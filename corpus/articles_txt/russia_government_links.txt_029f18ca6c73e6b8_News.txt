Mikhail Mishustin’s remarks:
Mr Askar
Mamin, good afternoon. Colleagues, friends.
I would
like to join you in expressing gratitude to our Kazakh partners for the excellent
preparation of this meeting.
The
Shanghai Cooperation Organisation marks its 20th anniversary this year. In such
a short period – short by international associations’ standards – the SCO has evolved
as an effective format for interaction among Eurasian states, resolving regional
issues, and aligning national development strategies. For this purpose, it has
developed a solid regulatory framework covering a wide variety of fields from
politics and the economy to security and humanitarian ties. Our states are
consistently deepening cooperation, implementing mutually beneficial
cross-border economic and investment projects and promoting significant
multilateral initiatives.
At the
September summit in Dushanbe, the leaders of our states identified the
priorities for further strengthening this organisation. Much work remains to be
done to implement the agreements reached at the highest level.
Meeting of the SCO Heads of Government Council
Over the
past few years, the world has faced profound, system-wide changes. The
coronavirus pandemic has led to a downturn in key sectors of the global economy,
pushing up unemployment. International value chains have been disrupted, and
trade and investment have shrunk.
The
external market environment is not exactly favourable either. Our Western
partners often use unfair competition strategies to keep their dominant
positions. Protectionist measures and illegal unilateral sanctions are
expanding.
Regional
conflicts are also escalating. The situation in Afghanistan, which is struggling
with an acute socioeconomic crisis, raises serious concern. It is important to
prevent that country, which is close to all of us, from sliding into a
humanitarian catastrophe. Following President Vladimir Putin instructions, we have
dispatched the first batch of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. Other SCO states
are also providing support to the Afghan people.
It is in
our common interests to ensure the peace, sovereignty and territorial integrity
of the Afghan state, freeing it from terrorism and drugs. It is essential for
the safe and stable development of our entire region. However, undoubtedly, the
main responsibility for post-conflict reconstruction should be borne by those
countries whose actions led to the present tragedy.
Colleagues,
It is important to note that CIS member states are
successfully overcoming the current difficulties.
Mutual trade is being gradually restored. In the
first eight months of 2021, Russia’s trade with our CIS partners expanded by
30.5 percent and exceeded $100 billion.
All states, including Russia, are taking action at the
national level to stabilise the domestic situation. And we can already see
certain results. At the end of the second quarter of 2021, Russia’s gross
domestic product recovered completely and topped pre-crisis levels.
In the nine months of 2021, industrial production grew
by over 4.5 percent in annual terms. The labour market situation improved, and
employment levels exceed pre-pandemic indicators. As instructed by President
Vladimir Putin, the Russian Government has drafted and approved new
socioeconomic development initiatives up to 2030. They reflect the modern
challenges that Russia should address. We will work on six key aspects, namely,
the social sphere, construction, the environment, digital transformation, a
technological breakthrough and welfare state.
Regarding the global economy, in order to ensure its
recovery, it is important to prevent the further decline in global trade. It is
necessary to preserve its institutional foundations that have been formulated
on the basis of the World Trade Organisation. This is the only way to ensure
clear, understandable and, most importantly, equitable rules of the game for
all participants.
And, of course, a wide-ranging macroeconomic policy coordination, on the basis
of openness and reciprocity, is essential. Today, we are witnessing
unprecedented demand for multilateral mechanisms of finding collective
solutions. In our opinion, the SCO could also play a leading role in this work.
We should continue to merge our national development
strategies and multilateral integration initiatives and build an area of trust,
equitable and mutually beneficial cooperation in Eurasia.
President Vladimir Putin’s initiative on
establishing a Greater Eurasian Partnership that would involve the countries of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the EAEU and the Shanghai
Cooperation Organisation, as well as other countries and regional associations,
hinges on precisely these principles.
The Memorandum of Understanding between the SCO
Secretariat and the Eurasian Economic Commission opens up good opportunities
for this. It stipulates expanding contacts in various directions, including the
economy and finance, as well as foreign trade and investment.
To strengthen
our cooperation, we should implement joint initiatives in the sphere of
transport. Six routes have been opened in accordance with the Agreement on
Facilitation of International Road Transport. We must make full use of them.
At present, some
20 million tonnes of cargo are annually transported from Asia to European
countries via Russia. Experts forecast that the cargo traffic will increase
several times over in 15-20 years and will reach some 100-150 million tonnes a
year.
To be able to
shoulder the increasing volume of cargo transportation, Russia, Kazakhstan and
China have launched the implementation of the Europe-Western China
international transit corridor.
Under his
project, Russia is building a motorway from Kazan to Moscow, which will have
access to the Baltic region and Northern Europe. We are preparing for the implementation
of the Meridian motorway project, which could have access to Central Europe via
Belarus. The implementation of this crucial strategic project will be in the
long-term interests of all SCO countries and will help strengthen transport,
logistics and cooperation ties. In light of environmental challenges, we will
stipulate the broad use of natural-gas-based
vehicles on the Meridian route. Our next task is to formulate measures for
coordinated infrastructure development based on digital technology and
cutting-edge intellectual systems.
Regrettably, we
have not yet coordinated our positions in this area. We must coordinate our
approaches without delay and reach agreements on the SCO road development
programme.
We will continue
our digital economy cooperation within the framework of the SCO. The world is
rapidly moving towards a new technological paradigm. We have the capability to
take leading positions on this track.
Russia is ready
to share its achievements in the sphere of remote employment and education
services, public services and telemedicine. We have scored success in the field
of database management platforms and in the development of AI-based solutions.
The SCO
countries have adopted the Concept of Cooperation of the SCO
Member States in Digitalisation and ICT. I would
like to urge our partners to more actively contribute to drafting a plan for
its implementation.
It would be
useful to develop cooperation for the digitalisation of the legal sphere. Russia
has forwarded to its partners a draft concept and a draft agreement on the SCO
electronic platform for the provision of legal assistance in civil matters.
The active
introduction of modern technologies has presented us with a new challenge: to
overcome the digital divide. Last year we approved the Concept
for Cooperation Between the SCO Member States in Developing Remote and Rural
Areas in the Digital Era. The SCO Best Solutions Bank looks like the best mechanism for the implementation of the concept.
It comprises over 170 technologies and practices in the field of
infrastructure, public and financial services, agriculture, education and
healthcare. We need to reach a compromise on this project as soon as possible,
so that all SCO counties have access to such solutions.
Digitalisation
is being accompanied by green transformation of the economy.
Meanwhile, some states are attempting to leverage
these trends to gain a competitive advantage in emerging markets. There are
attempts to promote green protectionism, to introduce additional taxes or
administrative barriers to international trade, which run counter to the WTO
rules and principles.
It is imperative that we pay the utmost attention to
these actions, in particular when implementing the
SCO Green Belt Programme and the Concept of the SCO Member States’ Cooperation
in Environmental Protection. We propose that the foreign ministries convene
consultations with representatives of relevant agencies, including on
decarbonising the economy.
International settlements are a separate issue. Clearly, we need
reliable mechanisms to finance the SCO projects. The use of national currencies
will help reduce dependence on external factors and cut conversion and
transaction costs. In the long term, this will improve financial stability and
create conditions for entering new markets and building production chains
between our countries. Russia advocates the early adoption of the roadmap for a
gradual increase in the share of national currencies in mutual settlements.
Now, I will briefly cover humanitarian cooperation which continues even
amid the pandemic. In October, the first SCO museum forum with the
participation of the member states and observer states was held in Tula.
The SCO University, which unites almost 80 higher educational
institutions, remains operational. It is essential to increase the number of SCO
University participants and new in-demand areas of education should be added to
its curriculum.
The Business Council, the Interbank Association and the SCO Youth
Council engage in vigorous activities.
Region-to-region cooperation is going strong. The Forum of Heads of
Regions holds a lot of promise for implementing specific projects.
All of the above goes to show that the peoples of the SCO countries are
interested in joint work across a variety of areas.
Colleagues,
The SCO is strengthening its position in the international arena year in
and year out.
The upcoming admission of Iran to the SCO and the granting of dialogue
partner status to Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia will significantly strengthen
the organisation’s potential and its role in international affairs.
The most important thing for all of us is to stop the spread of the
coronavirus and overcome its aftereffects. To do so, we must continue to
implement the Comprehensive Plan of Joint Action to Counteract the Threats of
Epidemics in the SCO Region and to ensure the teamwork of our sanitary and
epidemiological services. Russia proposes to hold a meeting of their leaders on
9 December to discuss in greater detail the steps to combat the pandemic.
Mr Mamin, in closing, I would like to congratulate you on the successful
completion of Kazakhstan’s chairmanship of the SCO Heads of Government Council.
I also wish every success to Mr Li Keqiang, in connection with the transfer of
the chairmanship to the People’s Republic of China.
I am confident that the SCO is capable of successfully achieving our
countries’ most challenging goals. Together, we will ensure the sustainable and
balanced growth of our respective economies and continue to work together for
the benefit of our peoples and states.
Thank you.
