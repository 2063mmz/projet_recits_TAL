Dmitry
Medvedev:
Mr President, your visit is yet another contribution to the
strengthening of our strategic partnership and cooperation. I am confident  your visit will help to further improve our
relations, which have already reached an unprecedentedly high level.
Our governments continue to
cooperate, and we meet regularly.
Last year, we met in St Petersburg
, and this year I
hope to visit your wonderful country for intergovernmental talks.
Jinping
(via interpreter)
We are pleased at the positive development of the Russian economy and
social stability in the country.
President Vladimir Putin
recently visited Beijing for the Belt and Road Forum, during which we agreed to
strengthen our relations in the new situation. We agreed to boost regional
economic integration, the parties’ economic globalisation, openness,
inclusiveness, common benefit, balance and mutual success in order to stand
together against global economic problems.
Our relations have always been
a foreign policy priority for China. We are confident of our cooperation with
Russia against global challenges. China and Russia should expand and deepen
their cooperation in the spirit of mutual support and openness in order to
create conditions for the joint development and revival of our countries and
also to give a powerful boost towards stronger peace and stable development in
the world as a whole.
