The newly released National Security Strategy signals a
marked reorientation
in U.S. engagement in Africa — moving away from an “aid-first, liberal-democracy promotion” model toward a more selective, partnership-based approach built around trade, investment, and conflict prevention.
Under this framework, Ethiopia — with its strategic location in the Horn of Africa, its history as a U.S. partner in counterterrorism, and its current legitimate calls for sea-access— emerges as a natural candidate for deeper U.S. cooperation. Several key factors explain why.
Firstly, Ethiopia has long contributed to regional efforts to counter militant Islamist movements such as Al-Shabaab. In the most recent
high-level visit
by the U.S., U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) Commander Dagvin R. M. Anderson met with Ethiopia’s leadership to emphasize shared threats from Islamic extremist groups. During the discussion, where Field Marshal Berhanu Jula was the top representative of Ethiopia, it was disclosed that General Anderson
praised
Ethiopia’s ongoing contribution to regional peace and security and confirmed U.S. support for Ethiopia’s efforts to counter terrorism.
The General’s visit to Ethiopia and the subsequent high-level discussion could be a primitive that Washington had taken the importance of strengthen counter-terrorism in the horn of Africa where Ethiopia is a potential long-standing partner. The new Strategy explicitly highlights the resurgence of Islamist terrorism in parts of Africa as a core concern — and underscores the need to cooperate with “capable, reliable states” rather than rely on prolonged large-scale deployments.
Secondly, Ethiopia sits at the crossroads of the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea / Bab el-Mandeb corridor, and the complex web of states and conflicts that stretch from the Horn to the Sahel and central Africa. The November 2025 Strategy names the Horn as a priority region for preventive diplomacy, given persistent tensions involving Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia.
Importantly, Ethiopia’s legitimate trajectory to regain access to the sea — either through Djibouti, a leased port, or maritime access via neighboring coastal zones — now resonates more directly with U.S. strategic goals.
Recent reporting
notes that U.S. backing could lend diplomatic legitimacy to Addis Ababa’s maritime ambitions, as maritime access for Ethiopia “is inseparable from national growth and sovereignty.”
Moreover, U.S. support for Ethiopia’s peaceful pursuit of sea access
was explicitly affirmed
by General Anderson during his 2025 visit. During this visit, he publicly expressed U.S. support for Ethiopia’s peaceful maritime ambitions and indicated he would brief Washington on Ethiopia’s priorities. While holding discussions with H.E. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, he said the U.S. would work with Ethiopia to explore cooperation that helps stabilize the Horn and open new economic and security opportunities.
The new U.S. strategy of shifting from an aid-centric relationship with African states to one oriented toward trade, investment, and mutual economic benefit is the third pillar where Ethiopia could position itself to benefit from it.
For Ethiopia, this could reopen a window of opportunity. The new strategy could potentially reform frameworks like the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).
Ethiopia, with its large population, youthful workforce and promising industrialization efforts, could become a key beneficiary of renewed U.S. trade and investment flows — especially in sectors such as energy, critical minerals, infrastructure, and manufacturing. This dovetails with long-standing Ethiopian ambitions to industrialize, expand export capacity, and reduce reliance on aid by diversifying its economy.
By combining its internal reforms and economic ambitions with U.S. investment, Ethiopia could anchor a new “investment and growth paradigm” — one that aligns with both American strategic objectives and Ethiopia’s development goals.
Moreover, the new Strategy foregrounds preventive diplomacy: the U.S. signals readiness to support negotiated settlements in existing conflicts (e.g., DRC–Rwanda, Sudan) and to prevent emergent ones — including potential flashpoints in the Horn (Ethiopia–Eritrea, Ethiopia–Somalia).
In this context, Ethiopia could play a pivotal role. As a relatively large, regionally influential state in the Horn, Addis Ababa could help broker or lend legitimacy to peace processes, especially if paired with U.S. diplomatic backing. Its renewed outreach to Eritrea over sea-access negotiations as Ethiopian high-level leaders including H.E. PM Abiy Ahmed have indicated, could be a test case — and an opportunity for Washington to deploy preventive diplomacy rather than reactive conflict management. During his November 2025 visit, General Anderson was
briefed
on a constructive exchange on regional security and opportunities for enhanced cooperation
That said, the alignment between U.S. strategic interests and Ethiopia’s ambitions is not without tension or risk. The main challenges involve resolving internal instability, which the government is working on; addressing neighboring states’ misconceptions (particularly Eritrea’s) regarding Ethiopia’s sea access move, which requires careful navigation; and, following its success with the Food Independency Initiative, ensuring the government sticks to the new investment and growth paradigm by avoiding reversion to an aid-dependent mindset.
Overall, the November 2025 U.S. National Security Strategy for Africa marks a turning point. By prioritizing conflict prevention, counterterrorism, investment, and trade — and by signaling selectivity rather than blanket engagement — Washington is opening a window for deeper, more strategic cooperation with states that can deliver. Ethiopia, because of its history, geography, ambitions, and potential, is among the strongest candidates to be such a partner.
The recent visit of General Dagvin Anderson underscores Washington’s serious intent: Ethiopia is no longer just part of a regional portfolio, but a focal point. By coupling diplomatic initiatives (such as sea access), internal stabilization, and economic reforms with its long-standing historical engagement, Addis Ababa could anchor a new model—one where the U.S.-Ethiopia relationship shifts from aid dependency toward shared security, mutual economic growth, and strategic cooperation.
Despite its rhetorical shift from aid to investment, the 2025 U.S. National Security Strategy reveals a narrow and instrumental reading of Africa’s strategic importance—one that risks reproducing extractive and quasi-colonial patterns of engagement. The Strategy explicitly prioritizes Africa’s “abundant natural resources and latent economic potential” and identifies “the energy sector and critical mineral development” as areas offering “a good return on investment” for the United States, including nuclear energy, liquefied natural gas, and mineral extraction (U.S. National Security Strategy, 2025). While framed as mutually beneficial, this emphasis sidelines Africa’s structural governance, industrial, and institutional needs in favor of resource access and market opening for U.S. goods and services. By favoring “capable, reliable states committed to opening their markets,” the Strategy risks reducing African partnerships to transactional arrangements that privilege external demand over endogenous development priorities, thereby reinforcing asymmetries long associated with colonial and post-colonial economic relations (U.S. National Security Strategy, 2025).
Moreover, although Washington has demonstrated constructive diplomatic engagement—most notably by supporting negotiated de-escalation efforts between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo—the Strategy treats peace building largely as a means of stabilizing environments for investment rather than as an end rooted in African political agency. Conflict mediation is framed alongside preventing threats to U.S. interests and avoiding “any long-term American presence or commitments,” signaling a preference for low-cost stabilization over sustained institution-building (U.S. National Security Strategy, 2025). This selective engagement risks leaving the underlying drivers of conflict—competition over resources, weak regional integration, and uneven development—unaddressed. By foregrounding counterterrorism, conflict containment, and mineral security while downplaying Africa’s role as a geopolitical, demographic, and normative actor in its own right, the Strategy may inadvertently perpetuate cycles of exploitation, instability, and external dependency, even as it claims to move beyond the aid paradigm (U.S. National Security Strategy, 2025).
