Hon. Dr. Tesfaye Bejigu and H.E. Jafar Bedru engaged with young diplomats in a dynamic training session, fostering insightful discussions on diplomacy, the philosophy of Medemer, and the challenges ahead. A thought-provoking exchange shaping the future of Ethiopia’s diplomacy.
H.E. Jafar Bedru delivered a profound lecture on the philosophy of Medemer at the Pre-Service Diplomatic Training Program, Civil Service University. At its core, Medemer is a philosophy of synthesis—uniting Ethiopia’s diverse society by focusing on commonalities rather than divisions.
It serves as both a diagnosis and a remedy for the fragmentation within the state, addressing governance challenges and legitimacy crises.
Medemer promotes the reintegration of political, economic, and social structures—offering a systematic approach to nation-building.
By fostering unity in diversity, Medemer envisions an Ethiopia strengthened by collaboration, shared history, and collective aspirations.
This philosophy is more than an idea; it’s a blueprint for sustainable governance and inclusive progress.
