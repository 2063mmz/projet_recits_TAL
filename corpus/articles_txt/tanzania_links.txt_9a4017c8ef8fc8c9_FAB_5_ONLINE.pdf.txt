During the first quarter of the 2025/2026 Financial Year (July–September
2025), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation continued
to advance Tanzania’s foreign policy priorities under the leadership of H.E. Dr..
Samia Suluhu Hassan, President of the United Republic of Tanzania. The Ministry
actively engaged in regional and international platforms to promote peace,
security, sustainable development, and economic diplomacy.
During this period Tanzania has worked with local, regional and international
stakeholders to steadfast its bilateral and multilateral relations as well as
developmental cooperation via expansion of tourism, trade and investment.
Between July and September 2025, I had the honour of receiving several high-
level ministerial delegations as part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen bilateral
cooperation with friendly nations. These engagements included visits from Hon.
Randeep Sarai, Canada’s Secretary of State for International Development; Hon.
Dr. Constantinos Kombos, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cyprus; Hon. Abdisalam
Abdi Ali, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Somalia; and Hon. Péter Szijjártó, Minister
for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary. During this period, we also held fruitful
consultations with Ambassadors, High Commissioners, and Representatives

of International Organizations accredited to Tanzania, focusing on deepening
bilateral relations and enhancing cooperation across various sectors.
In September 2025, I had the privilege of undertaking a historic four-day official
visit to London, marking the first visit by a Tanzanian Minister for Foreign Affairs
to the United Kingdom in fourteen years. The visit reaffirmed Tanzania’s strategic
commitment to expanding its international engagement in trade, investment,
and climate diplomacy. It also strengthened existing partnerships, opened
new pathways for collaboration, and underscored Tanzania’s position as a
stable, credible, and proactive partner in global affairs advancing our shared
diplomatic, economic, and environmental objectives with the United Kingdom.
As we continue to implement foreign policy, Tanzania participated at the 7th
Mid-Year Coordination Meeting between the African Union, Regional Economic
Communities and Regional Mechanisms in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, which
was held under the AU theme for 2025: ‘PAMOJA – Working Together to Ignite
Regional Integration’. During the meeting, heads of state and government
discussed Africa’s collective strategies for peace, economic integration, and
sustainable growth and reaffirmed the importance of Africa’s unity and the
implementation of Agenda 2063.
The United Republic of Tanzania hosted the Ministerial Committee of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) Organ on Politics, Defence
and Security Cooperation in Dar es Salaam as it winds-up the chairmanship of
the organ. The meeting provided an opportunity to review regional peace and
security developments, consolidate collective responses to emerging threats,
and strengthen political cooperation among Member States.
In August 2025, the United Republic of Tanzania concluded its tenure as Chair
of the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation. During this
period, H.E. Dr. Philip Isdor Mpango, the Vice President,  chaired the SADC Organ
Troika Summit held in Antananarivo, Madagascar, on behalf of H.E. Dr. Samia
Suluhu Hassan, President of the United Republic of Tanzania. In his capacity
as a chair, H.E. Dr. Mpango presided over high-level deliberations focused on
consolidating peace, strengthening democratic governance, and promoting
preventive diplomacy across the Southern African region. Furthermore, H.E. Dr.
Mpango represented H.E. President Dr. Samia at the SADC Summit, where regional
Heads of State and Government assessed progress made in advancing SADC’s
developmental agenda and deepening regional integration.
In early September, the United Republic of Tanzania also attended the African
Climate Summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which brought together leaders and
development partners to discuss the continent’s response to climate change
and pathways for financing renewable energy and adaptation initiatives.

Tanzania reaffirmed its commitment to implementing sustainable climate
actions, in line with national and continental priorities.
And later that month the Vice President H.E. Dr. Mpango represented H.E.
President Dr. Samia Suluhu Hassan at the 79th Session of the United Nations
General Assembly in New York, where Tanzania reiterated its commitment to
multilateralism, peace, and inclusive global development. On the sidelines of
the Assembly, Tanzania engaged in several high-level bilateral and multilateral
meetings aimed at strengthening its partnerships in trade, investment, and
environmental sustainability.
During the same quarter, Tanzania had the pleasure of hosting the Vice
President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, H.E. Col. (Rtd) Kembo Campbell Mohadi,
whose visit underscored the strong historical and fraternal relations between
the two nations. The discussions focused on enhancing bilateral cooperation
in trade, mining, agriculture, and education.
To further advance Tanzania’s engagement with landlocked developing
countries, we participated in the 3rd United Nations Conference on Landlocked
Developing Countries held in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan. In this forum, Tanzania
underscored its commitment to supporting regional transport corridors and
facilitating access to international markets through its ports and logistics
infrastructure.
During this quarter, Tanzania and Burundi also laid the foundation stone for the
Uvinza–Msongati Standard Gauge Railway Project, a strategic infrastructure
initiative that will enhance regional connectivity and boost trade between
Tanzania and neighbouring countries, particularly Burundi and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.
Collectively, these engagements reflect Tanzania’s steadfast dedication
to promoting peace, regional integration, sustainable development, and
international cooperation. As the Ministry moves forward, we remain committed
to implementing the country’s foreign policy objectives and ensuring that
diplomacy continues to serve as a bridge for prosperity and mutual benefit.
As we approach the final quarter of 2025, I would like to commend all staff, both at
headquarters and in our missions abroad, for their dedication, professionalism,
and tireless efforts. Let us continue to serve with integrity and excellence as we
represent the interests of our nation on the global stage.

I am pleased to present this edition of our Quarterly Bulletin, covering the
period from July to September 2025. This quarter has been both dynamic and
progressive, reflecting the Ministry’s ongoing commitment to strengthening
Tanzania’s foreign policy objectives, deepening regional and international
cooperation, and promoting our national interests abroad.
One of the key highlights of this quarter was the successful engagement with
the Pre-Election Observation Mission from the Electoral Commissions Forum
of the Southern African Development Community (SADC-ECF), the African
Union (AU), the Commonwealth, and the East African Community (EAC). These
missions underscored our country’s commitment to democratic governance,
transparency, and regional cooperation. Through fruitful discussions with
stakeholders—including the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)
and the  Electoral Commission (ZEC)—we demonstrated Tanzania’s readiness
for the upcoming General Elections and our openness to external observation in
line with regional bodies for stronger integrity.
On the bilateral and multilateral front, the Ministry has continued to implement
strategic diplomatic engagements aimed at attracting investment, enhancing
trade, and expanding development cooperation. We held productive discussions
with Ambassadors, High Commissioners and Representatives of International
Organizations accredited to Tanzania, as well as high-level leaders from

friendly nations like Canada, Somalia, Zimbabwe, Cyprus and Hungary These
engagements were all part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen diplomatic
ties and advance Tanzania’s national interests across political, economic, and
development fronts. We’ve also hosted delegations of businesses and investors
from government and private sectors who participated at the business and
investors forum both within Tanzania and abroad.
Our missions abroad remain critical actors in showcasing Tanzania’s economic
potential, cultural richness, leadership in regional peace and stability and
advancing Tanzania’s strategic interests on the global stage. They serve as vital
platforms for promoting the country’s economic potential—by attracting foreign
direct investment, facilitating trade partnerships, and showcasing opportunities
in sectors such as agriculture, tourism, energy, and infrastructure.
At the same time, our embassies and high commissions actively promote
Tanzania’s rich cultural heritage, which remains a powerful tool for fostering
people-to-people connections and enhancing our country’s image
internationally. Furthermore, our missions are instrumental in reinforcing
Tanzania’s long-standing reputation as a champion of peace, stability, and
multilateralism in the region. Through active participation in regional and
international forums, they contribute to dialogue on security, conflict resolution,
and sustainable development, further solidifying Tanzania’s leadership within
the region and beyond.
Internally, the Ministry has made progress in strengthening institutional capacity
and enhancing service delivery. Initiatives focusing on digital diplomacy,
performance monitoring, staff development, and recreational efforts continue
to be implemented as part of our broader reform agenda. We recognise that an
effective and modern foreign service is critical to achieving our national vision
in an increasingly complex global landscape.
As we are in the last quarter of the year 2025, I would like to commend all
staff, both at headquarters and in our missions abroad, for their dedication,
professionalism, and tireless efforts. Let us continue to serve with integrity and
excellence as we represent the interests of our nation on the regional and global
stage.
I thank you all and look forward to another impactful quarter ahead.

It is my pleasure to present this bulletin highlighting active engagement in East
African affairs during the period July to September 2025. This first quarter of the
2025 to 2026 financial year reflects our continued commitment to advancing
regional integration, sustainable development, and the shared prosperity of
the people of East Africa.
During the first quarter, we deepened our coordination with East African
Community institutions to fast track regional integration efforts. The Ministry
remains actively engaged in advancing the Common Market agenda,
supporting cross border infrastructure initiatives, and facilitating the free
movement of goods, services, and people, all of which are central to the socio
economic transformation of our region.
In this quarter we coordinated Tanzania’s participation in key East African
Community defence and security activities. In August 2025, we joined the
Concept Development Conference for the fourteenth EAC Command Post
Exercise “Ushirikiano Imara 2026” in Nairobi, focusing on operational planning,
logistics, and coordination among Partner States’ forces to enhance readiness
and joint response to regional security challenges.
The Ministry also took part in the forty first Meeting of the Sectoral Council on
Cooperation in Defence, held in Nairobi from 15 to 19 September 2025, where
Member States reviewed the regional security situation, approved the budget
for the 2026 exercise, and nominated Tanzania to host the sixth Civil Military
Cooperation (CIMIC) Week in August 2026.

Tanzania also hosted the Multi Agency Expert Working Group Meeting on the
EAC Mutual Defence Pact in Arusha from 22 to 24 September 2025, which
finalized the revised draft Pact reflecting Tanzania’s inputs on sovereignty, legal
alignment, and mutual defence obligations.
We also coordinated Tanzania’s participation in the inaugural EAC Ministerial
Conference on the Implementation of the East African Higher Education Common
Area (EACHEA), held in Kampala, Uganda. The conference underscored the
region’s collective resolve to harmonize higher education systems, promote
student and staff mobility, and strengthen academic collaboration to drive
innovation and socio economic transformation across the Community.
Equally significant was the fourteenth Mara Day Celebration, jointly hosted by
Tanzania and Kenya in Butiama, Mara Region, under the theme “Conserve the
Mara River: Sustain Life.” The event showcased the importance of cross border
cooperation in conserving shared ecosystems such as the Mara River Basin, an
essential lifeline for biodiversity, tourism, and livelihoods in the region.
As we are in the last quarter of 2025, Tanzania remains committed to
implementing EAC policies, decisions, and programmes that foster regional
cohesion, sustainable growth, and environmental stewardship. Through
continued collaboration with Partner States and EAC institutions, we are
determined to strengthen the foundations of an integrated, peaceful, and
prosperous East Africa.
I commend all staff, both at headquarters and in our missions abroad, for
their dedication, professionalism, and tireless efforts. Let us continue to serve
with integrity and excellence as we represent the interests of our nation on the
regional and global stage.

The Vice President of the United
Republic of Tanzania, H.E. Dr. Philip
Mpango, has called on global
partners to honor their commitments
on climate finance, urging for urgent
and equitable action to close Africa’s
growing adaptation and mitigation
funding gap.
Representing the President of
Tanzania, H.E. Dr. Samia Suluhu Hassan
at the Second Africa Climate Summit
held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from
8–10 September 2025, Dr. Mpango
stressed that despite contributing
less than four percent of global
emissions, Africa continues to suffer
the most from the effects of climate
change; including droughts, floods,
and rising sea levels that threaten
livelihoods and development gains.
Tanzania Urges Global Action to Bridge Africa’s
Climate Finance Gap
“Without urgent and scaled-up
support, our aspirations for resilience
and green development remain at
risk,” he warned, calling on developed
countries to double adaptation
financing, operationalize the Loss
and Damage Fund, and ensure that
adaptation is prioritized alongside
mitigation at COP30 in Brazil.
Dr. Mpango further emphasized the
need to translate Africa’s collective
commitments, outlined in the Nairobi
Declaration, into concrete global
action. He underscored Tanzania’s
dedication to environmental
sustainability through key initiatives
such as the Tanzania Vision 2050,
the National Environment Master Plan
(2022–2032), and the National Clean
Cooking Strategy (2024–2034), which

Africa’s Climate Finance
Demands Ahead of COP30
During a high-level panel on Africa’s
climate finance, Deputy Minister
for Foreign Affairs and East African
Cooperation, Hon. Cosato Chumi,
reaffirmed Tanzania’s call for fairness
and shared global responsibility. He
emphasized that climate finance
is about equity, not charity. Africa
needs USD 61 billion annually but
receives less than 36 percent, with
Sub-Saharan Africa getting under 5
percent. The panel, featuring regional
leaders, urged reforms in the global
financial system and mobilization
of USD 1.3 trillion annually until 2035
under a new climate goal.
“Africa is no longer waiting quietly
on the margins. We are stepping
forward to claim our rightful place in
global climate action. Our continent
deserves predictable, fair, and
adequate financing to implement

solutions for adaptation, mitigation,
and climate-resilient development.
This is not about charity; it is about
equity and global responsibility,” Hon.
Chumi said.

Opening the session titled “Clean

up sustainable solutions, financing,
and partnerships for clean energy
access,” Deputy Minister Chumi
underscored the importance of
regional cooperation, concessional
financing, technology transfer,
and infrastructure investment
to accelerate the clean energy
transition.
He revealed that Africa needs over
USD 2 billion annually to achieve its
clean cooking goals, while applauding
President Dr. Samia Suluhu Hassan’s
National Clean Cooking Strategy,
which targets 80 percent clean

Tanzania Calls for Fair, Predictable, and Sustainable
Development Finance at FfD4
By Staff Writer
The Vice President of the United Republic of Tanzania, H.E. Dr. Philip Mpango,
has called for reforms to the global financial architecture and development-
financing system to ensure lower interest costs, long-term sustainability,
predictability, and a stronger focus on equity and the priorities of developing
nations.
Speaking at the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development
(FfD4) in Seville, Spain, the Vice President underscored the importance of
innovative financing approaches, including converting financial debt into the
implementation of development projects—such as environmental conservation
initiatives.
He further noted that the methodologies used to assess governments’ debt-
repayment capacity should be reviewed to enhance transparency and fairness.
He added that the conference should deliver solutions to reduce borrowing
costs and expand access to affordable, long-term credit.
Emphasizing that trade is a pillar of economic growth, H.E. Dr. Mpango urged
support to enable countries to expand production and value addition to meet
international standards. He called for equity and fairness in international trade

rules and procedures, including customs duties and export restrictions affecting
developing countries.
The Vice President also stressed the need for cooperation between developed
and developing nations to accelerate progress in science, technology,
and statistics, so as to strengthen evidence-based policy formulation and
implementation.
He likewise highlighted the importance of partnerships with wealthier nations
to de-risk investments and to finance major, strategic development projects.
Strengthens Economic Ties with Spain, Showcasing
Investment Opportunities
Speaking at Tanzania-Spain Business Forum in Seville, Dr Philip Mpango
reaffirmed the government’s readiness to deepen collaboration with Spain’s
business community to advance Tanzania’s economic diplomacy agenda.
He highlighted Spain as a key partner in renewable energy, infrastructure,
agricultural technology, tourism, marine industries, and trade, inviting
Spanish investors to explore Tanzania’s vast investment potential in these
strategic sectors.
Dr. Mpango emphasised the private sector’s critical role in driving socio-
economic transformation, citing Tanzania’s political stability, strategic
location, abundant natural resources, youthful population, and strong
economic growth as solid foundations for long-term investment. He outlined
ongoing government reforms under President Dr Samia Suluhu Hassan to
enhance the business climate through legal, regulatory, and infrastructure
improvements.
He also encouraged investment in clean cooking technologies to combat
environmental degradation and called for partnerships in the blue economy,
focusing on value addition, technology transfer, and skills development to
promote sustainable growth.

Tanzania Anchors Southern Africa’s Peace Agenda
as Vice President Mpango Chairs SADC Organ
Troika Summit
By Ambassador Mindi Kasiga, ‘ndc’
The Troika of the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) convened on 16 August
2025 in Antananarivo, Madagascar, under the leadership of H.E. Dr Philip Isdor
Mpango, Vice President of the United Republic of Tanzania. Representing H.E.
President Samia Suluhu Hassan, Chairperson of the Organ, Dr. Mpango presided
over deliberations aimed at consolidating peace, strengthening democracy,
and advancing preventive diplomacy across Southern Africa.
The Troika Summit crowned a three-tier preparatory process. On 15 August,
Tanzania’s Permanent Secretary Ambassador Samwel Shelukindo chaired the
Senior Officials Meeting, followed by the Ministerial Committee of the Organ
(MCO) led by Foreign Minister Hon. Ambassador Mahmoud Thabit Kombo.
These sessions fed into the high-level summit, ensuring a seamless flow from
technical expertise to ministerial guidance and political decision-making
reflecting Tanzania’s diplomatic finesse in steering the organ’s agenda.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS BULLETIN

HIGH-LEVEL STATE, OFFICIAL AND WORKING VISITS
In his opening remarks, Vice President Mpango conveyed President Samia’s
greetings and reaffirmed Tanzania’s commitment to the Organ as the
cornerstone of SADC’s security framework. Since assuming the Chairmanship
in August 2024, Tanzania has presided over five Extraordinary Summits of Heads
of State and Government, an exceptional record underscoring the urgency of
security concerns and Tanzania’s decisive leadership.
President Samia’s stewardship has been historic. As the first Tanzanian woman
to chair the organ, she has left an indelible imprint on the region’s peace and
security landscape. Soft-spoken yet assertive, she blends humility with bold
decision-making, commanding the respect of her peers. She convened the
first-ever Joint EAC–SADC Summit, tackling complex crises, from Rwanda–DRC
tensions to instability in eastern Congo, while ensuring SADC remained united
around the principle of African-led solutions to African challenges.
During her tenure, Tanzania guided SADC Electoral Observation Missions
(SEOMs) in Mozambique, Botswana, Mauritius, and Namibia. Breaking with
tradition, President Samia appointed Tanzania’s eminent statesmen and
women to lead the missions rather than foreign ministers. Dr. Amani Abeid
Karume, former President of Zanzibar, led in Mozambique; Mizengo Kayanza
Peter Pinda, former Prime Minister, in Botswana; Mohamed Chande Othman,
former Chief Justice, in Mauritius; and Anne Semamba Makinda, the first female
Speaker of the National Assembly, in Namibia. This approach underscored her
conviction that impartiality, experience, and moral authority enhance electoral
credibility. The missions strengthened democratic institutions by reinforcing
transparency, fairness, and adherence to SADC principles of governance.
Tanzania’s chairmanship also oversaw the transition in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) from military intervention to coordinated diplomacy.
Following the conclusion of the SADC Mission in the DRC (SAMIDRC), the Joint
SADC–EAC Summit of 13 August 2025 endorsed a harmonised framework: the
AU-led Nairobi–Luanda–SADC peace process, under the leadership of the AU
Commission. Vice President Mpango hailed this as “an affirmation of African
solutions to African problems”, echoing a principle central to Tanzania’s foreign
policy since the Nyerere era.
At the Senior Officials Meeting, Ambassador Shelukindo emphasised the
inseparable link between peace and sustainable development, urging
investment in mediation and preventive diplomacy. With three member states
heading to elections in 2025, he urged SEOM to deploy observers to those
members, namely Tanzania, Seychelles and Malawi, underscoring the SADC
commitment to democratic transparency.

HIGH-LEVEL STATE, OFFICIAL AND WORKING VISITS
At the ministerial level, Foreign Minister Kombo outlined Tanzania’s achievements:
convening five Extraordinary Summits, leading four SEOMs, and mobilising
responses to the eastern DRC crisis. He credited President Samia’s leadership
with advancing the principle of “African solutions to African problems” through
diplomacy, peacekeeping, and support for democratic institutions.
At the summit, Vice President Mpango formally invited SADC to observe
Tanzania’s October elections, underscoring openness and confidence in
regional solidarity. He highlighted Tanzania’s coordination of the Luanda and
Nairobi processes and recalled the historic joint EAC–SADC Summit hosted in
Dar es Salaam.
Summit leaders addressed pressing challenges, notably instability in eastern
DRC. They endorsed the consolidated AU-led framework as the path forward.
Progress in Mozambique and Lesotho was noted, with a call for vigilance
and sustained support, while the DRC–Zambia border issue was flagged for
dialogue-based resolution.
On democracy, leaders praised recent peaceful elections and reaffirmed
commitments to implement SEOM recommendations. Tanzania’s formal
invitation for observation of its October general elections carried symbolic
weight, reflecting confidence in regional democracy.
The discussions also spotlighted preventive diplomacy, recognizing the Panel
of Elders, Mediation Reference Group, and the new SADC Network of Women
Mediators as essential to inclusive peacebuilding. Leaders further expressed

concern over emerging threats such as terrorism, cybercrime, organised crime,
and climate-induced disasters thereafter resolving to strengthen the Regional
Counter-Terrorism Centre (RCTC) and enhance cooperation among member
states’ security institutions.
Tanzania’s leadership of the organ is rooted in its liberation-era legacy. Under
Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, Tanzania provided sanctuary and support to Southern
Africa’s liberation movements, shaping the foundations of today’s SADC Organ.
This tradition of solidarity and principled leadership endures in Tanzania’s
modern diplomacy. From crisis mediation to electoral oversight, Tanzania has
consistently been at the forefront of SADC’s peace agenda. Under President
Samia, this legacy has been revitalised with renewed focus on preventive
diplomacy, democratic governance, and harmonised African-led solutions.
The Antananarivo meetings of August 2025 showcased Southern Africa’s
determination to safeguard peace and democracy. At the centre stood
Tanzania, a nation blending its liberation heritage with modern diplomatic
leadership.
As the Chairship passes to Malawi, Tanzania leaves a legacy of decisive action,
principled leadership, and enduring solidarity. From the vision of Nyerere to the
diplomacy of President Samia Suluhu Hassan, Tanzania continues to embody
the spirit of unity and resilience, reminding the region that peace is both a
historic mission and a continuing responsibility.

and culture. They highlighted opportunities under the African Continental
Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and SADC to boost intra-African trade, especially in
agriculture.
Vice President Mpango encouraged Zimbabwean investors to utilize Tanzania’s
Dar es Salaam Port as a gateway for regional and global trade. Bilateral trade
between the two countries has grown significantly—from TZS 21.1 billion in 2017
to TZS 115.9 billion in 2023—with five Zimbabwean investment projects valued at
USD 11.64 million, generating 247 jobs in Tanzania.
Honouring Shared Liberation Heritage
H.E. Vice President Mohadi expressed deep gratitude for Tanzania’s unwavering
solidarity during Zimbabwe’s liberation struggle, recalling the country’s role as
a haven for Southern African freedom fighters. He emphasized the importance

Vice President Dr. Mpango Urged International
Community to Prioritize Peace, Sustainable
Development, and Justice for African at UNGA 80
By Koleta Njelekela
The Vice President of the United
Republic of Tanzania, H.E. Dr. Philip Isdor
Mpango, condemned the resurgence
of violations of international law and
the use of force to resolve conflicts—
practices that inflict extreme harm
on civilians—during his address to the
80th Session of the United Nations
General Assembly on 25 September
2025 in New York. He spoke on behalf
of H.E. President Samia Suluhu Hassan.
Dr. Mpango decried “imperial
attitudes,” including treating Africa as
a mere source of raw materials, and
criticized multinational corporations
that profit from natural-resource
extraction in ways that fuel or abet
conflict. He reiterated Tanzania’s
rejection of unilateralism, the abuse
of military power, and the failure by
the international community to halt
ongoing wars.
The Vice President urged recognition
that rising military expenditures—
including research and weapons
manufacturing—divert resources
from sustainable development and
human well-being. He called on the
world to persist in pursuing peace
and commended ongoing mediation
efforts in eastern DRC, Sudan, Russia-
Ukraine, and the Middle East. He also
called for the full inclusion of women in
peace processes, marking Beijing+30.
Applauding President Samia Suluhu
Hassan’s leadership, he cited her
advocacy for peace, justice, security,
and clean cooking at regional and
global levels. He highlighted Tanzania’s

active role on the AU Peace and Security
Council and its recent chairship of the
SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and
Security Cooperation.
Dr. Mpango announced Tanzania’s
candidacy for a non-permanent UN
Security Council seat for 2029–2030,
reaffirming the country’s commitment
to global peace and security. He
reiterated Africa’s call to reform the
Security Council, seeking at least two
permanent African seats with veto if
the veto is retained.
Aligning with other nations, he urged
comprehensive reform of the global
financial system, including more long-
term concessional finance, reform of
sovereign credit rating frameworks, and
rethinking debt sustainability to unlock
investment in infrastructure, education,
health, and climate resilience. He also
called for expanded African voice in
the governance of the IMF and World
Bank.
Reporting on Tanzania’s SDG
implementation, the Vice President
said overall performance is “estimated
at 60%,” and cited national gains in
health (SDG 3), water (SDG 6), and
energy (SDG 7). According to his
statement, maternal mortality declined
“from 750 to 104”—figures presented
as per 1,000 live births—and access
to clean and safe water increased
to 79.9% (rural) and 94% (urban) by
2024; electrified villages rose to 12,318,
with only 15 remaining unconnected.
Note: global health agencies report
maternal mortality per 100,000 live
births (Tanzania ~276 in 2023). Editors
may wish to retain the Vice President’s
figures as direct attribution or convert
to internationally used units once
official national data are provided.
Looking ahead to COP30 in Brazil, Dr.
Mpango urged delivery on climate
pledges, including capitalizing the
Loss and Damage Fund, expanding
concessional finance, facilitating
technology transfer, and advancing
fair trade that supports domestic
revenue generation. He noted the
launch of Tanzania Vision 2050 in mid-
2025, aligning national development
with the SDGs.
He closed by calling on all UN member
states to strengthen multilateral
institutions and place peace and
sustainable development at the
forefront as the UN marks 80 years
since its founding.

lights and televisions and to charge mobile phones and other household
devices.
More than five million batteries have been charged and used, with each
station capable of serving up to 100 households and creating employment
opportunities for over 500 women in Tanzania and Nigeria.
Together, these visits reflect Canada’s integrated approach to development—
bridging health, energy, and agriculture to build resilient communities and
foster long-term growth in Tanzania.
Speaking at the conclusion of the visit, Minister Sarai praised the leadership
of H.E. President Samia Suluhu Hassan, commending her efforts to improve
healthcare and inclusive development in Tanzania.
He pledged Canada’s continued collaboration in advancing shared priorities
and delivering tangible results for Tanzanian citizens.
Welcoming the support, Tanzania’s Minister of Health, Hon. Jenista Mhagama,
highlighted the impact of Canadian assistance on the country’s health
outcomes and noted that between 2015 and 2022, under-five child mortality in
Tanzania dropped from 67 to 43 per 1,000 live births, while maternal mortality
fell from 556 to 104 per 100,000 live births—significant progress made possible
in part due to targeted investments in health infrastructure, capacity-building,
and service delivery.
Several flagship Canadian-funded programs were highlighted during the visit,
including the AHADI Project implemented by World Vision (TZS 38.8 billion), the
GRREAT Project led by UNICEF (TZS 51.7 billion), and the Strengthening Midwifery
Initiative supported by AMREF and partners (TZS 30.4 billion).
These initiatives represent a comprehensive strategy to transform Tanzania’s
health sector, with a focus on empowering local health workers, improving
service accessibility, and saving lives.
Canada’s renewed commitment not only reaffirms its role as a key development
partner to Tanzania but also demonstrates the value of long-term, people-
centered cooperation in achieving sustainable and inclusive development
outcomes.

Africa is informed by the prevailing global economic and political transitions, which
necessitate stronger international solidarity. He emphasized that both Africa and
Singapore are strategically positioned to foster meaningful cooperation—Africa
with its abundant natural resources, dynamic population growth, and expanding
consumer markets, and Singapore with its advanced technology and economic
expertise.
Dr. Balakrishnan further highlighted Africa’s strategic advantages, citing its
population of 1.3 billion, vast land resources, youthful workforce with nearly 70
percent under the age of 30, sustained peace and stability, expanding economies,
and rich endowment of raw materials. He emphasized that these factors provide
compelling incentives for Singapore to strengthen and deepen its partnership with
the continent.
For his part, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation, Hon.
Amb. Mahmoud Thabit Kombo, who led the Tanzanian delegation to the meeting,
affirmed that the Government of Tanzania will actively collaborate with key national
stakeholders including government institutions, the private sector and academia
to fully leverage the scholarships, trade frameworks and investment opportunities
made available through SAMEV.
Minister Hon. Amb. Kombo underscored that the opportunities presented will play a
significant role in transforming Tanzania agriculture into a modern and high-value
sector, fostering the development of a skilled and globally competitive workforce,
accelerating the pace of industrialization and advancing the integration of digital
solutions in governance and commerce.
According to the Tanzania Investment and Special Economic Zones Authority
(TISEZA), between 1997 and July 2025 a total of 36 projects from Singapore, valued
at USD 535.13 million, were registered in the country and created approximately
3,228 jobs. Most of the investments are in the industrial sector, which accounts for
21 out of the 36 projects.
For Tanzania, Singapore offers not just trade opportunities but also a model of
rapid economic transformation. The Southeast Asian nation, despite its small size
and limited natural resources, has built a globally competitive economy through
strategic investments in human capital, innovation, and efficient governance. These
lessons resonate strongly with Tanzania as it seeks to accelerate industrialization
and digitization.

as a cornerstone of Tanzania–Vietnam relations. Vietnam is now the seventh
largest export destination for Tanzanian products. Data shows that Tanzanian

By Tatu Lugusa
The Deputy Minister for Foreign
Affairs and East African Cooperation
responsible for East African Affairs,
Hon. Denis Londo, has expressed
profound appreciation to the
International Federation of Red Cross
and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)

delivered swiftly and effectively. Hon.
Londo underscored that stronger
partnerships between international
organizations and national agencies
are essential for providing timely and
well-coordinated emergency aid.
“The IFRC’s presence and continued
cooperation with our local agencies

Shattering Ceilings: President Samia Leads the
SADC Organ — A First for Women and a Catalyst for
Regional Security
By Staff Writer
August 2024–August 2025 marked a historic term for Southern Africa’s security
architecture: for the first time, the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security
Cooperation was chaired by a woman, H.E. Samia Suluhu Hassan, President of
the United Republic of Tanzania. Her tenure combined clear-eyed diplomacy
with practical coordination across regional mechanisms to address conflicts,
strengthen electoral integrity, and advance counterterrorism cooperation.
A Mandate with Momentum
Assuming the chair in August 2024, President Samia set out a pragmatic agenda:
reinforce collective security through earlier risk detection, faster political-
diplomatic engagement, and disciplined follow-through on summit decisions.
The approach emphasized on:- Prevention first- sharpening early warning
and political good offices to manage tensions before they escalate; Principled
dialogue - using quiet diplomacy to unlock stalled tracks while upholding
sovereignty and regional instruments. Delivery - converting communiqués into
sequenced actions; and Strengthening Conflict Prevention and Response
REGIONAL INTEGRATION AND MULTILATERAL DIPLOMACY

Under the Organ Troika framework, Tanzania prioritized synchronized political,
security and humanitarian lines of effort in conflict-affected areas. This
included convening high-level discussions with troop-contributing countries
and insisting on tighter coordination between military mandates and political
dialogue so that security gains translate into durable stability.
A major decision during the Chairship was the decision of the Extraordinary
Summit of SADC Heads of State and Government held in March 2025, which
approved the withdrawal of the SADC Mission in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (SAMIDRC).         The withdrawal aimed to create space for renewed
diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict.
Convening the Historic Joint EAC–SADC Summit and other
meetings
On 8 February 2025 in Dar es Salaam, President Samia hosted the first-ever Joint
Extraordinary Summit of EAC and SADC Heads of State and Government on the
situation in eastern DRC. The Summit:  Directed the merger and alignment of the
Luanda and Nairobi peace tracks to avoid duplication and accelerate coherence
under a single, reinforced facilitation architecture;  Called for renewed political
dialogue, including direct engagement with armed groups under agreed
parameters, to complement security operations and humanitarian access;
Tasked the Secretariats (EAC, SADC, and the AU Commission) to operationalize
the merged track and report on milestones.

The decision moved the region from parallelism to structured complementarity,
creating a clearer ladder of political de-escalation, verification, and
accountability.
In July 2025, Tanzania also hosted and chaired the 27th Meeting of the Ministerial
Committee of the Organ (MCO) on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation
in Dar es Salaam. The meeting reviewed critical issues emerging from various
technical and political structures within the Organ, including the Inter-State
Politics and Diplomacy Committee (ISPDC) which had convened in February
2025 in Dar es Salaam, the Inter-State Defence and Security Committee (ISDSC)
which met in Arusha from 26th  to 31st  May 2025, and the Public Security
Sub-Committee (PSSC), whose meetings in June 2025 addressed policing,
immigration, correctional services, refugee management, and anti-corruption.
Championing Electoral Integrity
A signature of the term was credible, peaceful elections. Tanzania seconded
some of its eminent leaders to lead SADC Electoral Observation Missions
(SEOMs), underscoring both regional solidarity and national capacity as follows:
H.E. Dr. Amani Abeid Karume, former President of Zanzibar - Head of SEOM to
Mozambique (October 2024 general elections); H.E. Mizengo Kayanza Peter
Pinda, former Prime Minister of Tanzania - Head of SEOM to Botswana (October
2024 general elections); Hon. Justice Mohamed Chande Othman, former Chief
Justice of Tanzania - Head of SEOM to Mauritius (November 2024 National
Assembly elections); and Hon. Anne Semamba Makinda, former Speaker of the
National Assembly - Head of SEOM to Namibia (National/Presidential elections).
The missions emphasized adherence to the revised SADC Principles and
Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections (2021), promoted professional
observation methodology, and issued recommendations to strengthen
electoral management.
Advancing Regional Security and Counterterrorism
Cooperation
Tanzania’s chairpersonship highlighted the need to strengthen regional
resilience against terrorism and violent extremism, prioritizing information
sharing, border management, and technical assistance to member states
under the SADC Counter-Terrorism Strategy. The Organ also pressed for
tighter linkages between security operations and political dialogue in complex
theatres, ensuring that military efforts are sequenced with credible diplomatic
off-ramps and community stabilization.
Tanzania’s Distinctive Contribution
Beyond the process, President Samia’s leadership brought a tone of inclusive,
solutions-oriented statecraft: elevating women’s leadership at the apex of
regional security; investing political capital in electoral credibility; and building

bridges across regional economic communities. The result was a year defined
by practical coordination, more joint planning, clearer mandates, and steadier
diplomatic engagement.
Looking Ahead
The next phase will test implementation of priorities including Operationalizing
the merged DRC track with a public timeline for benchmarks, spoilers’
accountability, and humanitarian access; Following through on SEOM
recommendations with peer support to electoral bodies ahead of upcoming
cycles; and Deepening counterterrorism cooperation through early warning
systems.
President Samia’s historic tenure not only shattered a glass ceiling; it also raised
the floor for what a regional security chairpersonship can deliver; a standard
of disciplined diplomacy, regional cohesion, and democratic resilience across
Southern Africa.

The outgoing Chairperson,
President Emmerson Mnangagwa of
Zimbabwe, assured the community
that the political situation in the
region is stable except for the eastern
part of the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC). He said ongoing
efforts require unity, solidarity, and
genuine commitment to resolve
that conflict. He underscored the
importance of the concept of African
solutions to African problems that
emphasize the continent to address
its own challenges through internal
initiatives rather than relying on
external interventions, noting external
efforts should be recognized only as
supplementary.
Regarding the economy, the
leaders stressed the importance
of developing the industrial sector,
agriculture, trade, and value addition
of raw materials. They said, if these
sectors are well developed, they
will boost the economy, generate
employment, and increase income,
especially for youth and women who
constitute a large proportion of the
African population.
On infrastructure development, taking
into account roads, railways, water,

energy, and ICT, it was stated that
these are the core to accelerating
development and integration.
Countries were urged to seek funding
to finance infrastructure projects
outlined in the Regional Indicative
Strategic Development Plan 2030 and
to accelerate the process of adopting
the protocol establishing the regional
development fund. 9th countries,
out of 16th including Tanzania, have
already signed the protocol.
On democracy, a call was made to
all countries to strengthen institutions
that oversee the promotion of
democracy and to enhance the
SADC Electoral Observation Mission
to ensure member states conduct
free, fair, and transparent elections.

Tanzania’s Multilateralism at 80 Years of the UN
By Amb. Mindi Kasiga, ‘ndc’
In September 2025, the United Nations
marked its 80th anniversary, and
Tanzania stepped onto the General
Assembly stage with a familiar
confidence and a contemporary
register. Vice President Dr. Philip Isdor
Mpango addressed the Assembly
on behalf of President Samia Suluhu
Hassan, the first diplomat whose
transformative, bridge-building
diplomacy has reopened Tanzania’s
global windows while deepening
its regional roots. The address was
unmistakably Tanzanian: principled,
practical, and coalition minded. It
drew from Mwalimu Julius Nyerere’s
legacy, updated for a century defined
by climate risk, financial asymmetry,
and persistent conflict.
From Nyerere’s time onward, Tanzania
has treated multilateralism not as
a venue but as a vocation. Dar es
Salaam hosted liberation movements
and advanced the then-contested
view that African freedom was
REGIONAL INTEGRATION AND MULTILATERAL DIPLOMACY
inseparable from a just international
order. Non-alignment for Mwalimu
and his peers was never passivity; it
was an active, principled refusal to
let great-power rivalry script Africa’s
future. He carried that ethic to the
UN, insisting that silence in the face
of injustice “surrenders our freedom
and dignity”, a line the Vice President
revived to frame today’s crises.
In those years, Tanzania helped
give institutional form to regional
solidarity, backing what became
SADC and championing the OAU’s
collective-security reflex. A habit took
root: mobilize coalitions, privilege
dialogue, and, when necessary,
shoulder costly commitments; from
hosting refugees to supporting peace
efforts. This is because the moral
arithmetic pointed that way.
Successive presidents translated
that ethic into fresh instruments.
President Ali Hassan Mwinyi opened

FOREIGN AFFAIRS BULLETIN
July – September 2025

Tanzania’s economy and diplomacy
simultaneously, showing that
engagement with global markets
can sit alongside a social-justice
society. President Benjamin Mkapa,
a deft international advocate,
became a leading African voice on
debt relief, trade equity, and policy
space for developing countries—
fact-based, coalition-minded, and
unafraid to challenge orthodoxy—
anticipating today’s calls to remodel
the global financial architecture.
President Jakaya Kikwete invested
in regionalism, revitalizing the East
African Community and, as AU Chair,
steering collective responses to crises,
normalizing the notion that African
problems should first be addressed
through African platforms, then
amplified globally. President John
Magufuli’s tenure tightened the focus
on domestic industrialization and
infrastructure; even then, the beacon
of rules-based regional integration
within the EAC and SADC held.
President Samia Suluhu Hassan has
reopened Tanzania’s international
windows while keeping its feet
planted in regional terrain. The Vice
President’s address reflects that re-
engagement: clear support for UN
reform; a call for equity in IMF and
World Bank governance; and a climate
agenda that links emissions justice
to practical instruments, long-term
concessional finance, technology
transfer, and capitalization of the
Loss and Damage Fund.
Three through-lines stand
out
First, law and legitimacy over force and
unilateralism. The address centers
the UN Charter: conflicts should
be resolved through dialogue and
international law, not the misuse of
REGIONAL INTEGRATION AND MULTILATERAL DIPLOMACY
military might. That stance is rooted in
lived history. Tanzania has mediated,
contributed to peacekeeping,
chaired the SADC Organ on Politics,
Defence and Security, and served on
the AU Peace and Security Council.
The announced candidacy for a
2029–2030 UN Security Council
seat follows logically: if you believe
in rules, you should help write and
apply them. Consistent solidarity with
Palestine and Western Sahara as well
as opposition to sanctions regimes
lacking Security Council mandate,
springs from the same well: sovereign
equality as practice, not slogan.
Second, reform anchored in
inclusion. The speech marries
respect for the UN’s founding vision
with a frank demand to renovate
its rooms. Tanzania welcomes the
UN-at-80 reform push but ties
trust to transparent process and
equitable outcomes. The reference
to the Ezulwini Consensus that is two
permanent African seats with full
prerogatives, including the veto if it is
retained, signals both principle and
patience wearing thin. Likewise, the
call to rebalance the financial system
that include fairer credit ratings,
rethought debt sustainability, and
scaled concessional finance; is not
new for Tanzania; it is Mkapa’s legacy
adapted to a climate-constrained
world where development and
decarbonization are a single problem.
Third, development as peace
in practice. The SDG inventory
that is spanning health, water,
and energy access, translates
multilateral commitments into
measurable national progress while
candidly noting gaps, especially in
environmental sustainability. This is
classic Tanzanian multilateralism:
connect global compacts to local

FOREIGN AFFAIRS BULLETIN
July – September 2025
135
delivery, then return to the table
asking for tools that match the
tasks. Vision 2050 is presented not
as a substitute for the SDGs but as a
bridge beyond 2030, an offer to keep
the development bargain alive if the
world meets Africa halfway.
There is also tonal continuity: moral
clarity without moralism. The Vice
President decries “the law of the
jungle,” the exploitation of Africa’s
resources linked to conflict, and
the perversity of spiraling military
expenditures that crowd out human
development. Yet the speech does
not end in grievance; it lands on
partnership: “win-win” arrangements
for natural-resource development,
women at the center of peace
processes, and an invitation to
recommit to the Charter’s basic
bargain.
Crucially, Tanzania couples values
with venues. It works through
concentric circles—local peace
initiatives, SADC mechanisms, EAC
integration, and AU frameworks—and
then escalates issues to the UN, where
legitimacy can be consolidated. That
laddered multilateralism is how a
REGIONAL INTEGRATION AND MULTILATERAL DIPLOMACY
medium-sized state wields outsized
influence: by being the steady hand
in rooms that change, the coalition-
builder when tempers run hot, and
the memory when institutions forget
why they exist.
If Nyerere gave Tanzania its
multilateral conscience, his successors
provided continuity and tools. Today’s
leadership adds urgency shaped
by our times: a planet on the clock,
a development agenda off track, a
financial order misaligned with need,
and wars that tear through norms and
neighborhoods alike. In that context,
the Vice President’s address reads as
both reaffirmation and brief: defend
the Charter, renovate the house, fund
the promises, and trust the method—
patient, principled, coalition-driven
multilateral diplomacy.
That is how Tanzania intends to
strengthen multilateralism now: by
insisting that the UN’s 80th year be
more than a commemoration. It should
be a recommitment to a way of doing
politics that Tanzania has practiced for
six decades, that is solidarity with teeth,
law with a voice, and development
that makes peace durable.

By Koleta Njelekela
The Vice President of the United Republic of Tanzania, H.E. Dr. Philip Isdor Mpango,
has reaffirmed Tanzania’s readiness to deepen economic engagement with the
United States, underscoring ongoing reforms aimed at creating a predictable,
competitive, and investor-friendly business environment.
Speaking at the Tanzania–U.S. Business and Investment Forum on the margins
of the Eightieth Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 80)
at the Park Lane Hotel in New York, Dr. Mpango highlighted recent policy
measures—including the revised National Foreign Policy launched in May
2025, improvements to the legal and regulatory framework, and continued
investments in infrastructure—that collectively position Tanzania as a gateway
to regional markets.
“We stand ready to work hand-in-hand with American and Tanzanian partners to
unlock our country’s full potential,” Dr. Mpango said, noting ongoing investments
by U.S. companies such as Visa, Cisco, and Coca-Cola as reflections of growing
international confidence.
Strengthening the Investment Climate
The Vice President emphasized that the Government is accelerating regulatory
reforms, streamlining approvals, and investing in skills development to improve
the ease of doing business. Central to these efforts is the restructuring of the
Tanzania Investment and Special Economic Zones Authority (TISEZA), which
has reduced the processing time for business permits from 14 days to 24 hours.

These measures, he noted, are designed to minimize administrative bottlenecks,
catalyze high-value investment, and promote fair, transparent competition.
Dr. Mpango reaffirmed the Government’s commitment to targeted investment
incentives and to a strong pipeline of transformative connectivity projects. He
further underscored Tanzania’s political stability, liberal economic orientation,
and rapid infrastructure development as robust foundations for long-term
private-sector growth.
Rising Trade and Investment with the United States
Citing recent performance, Dr. Mpango reported that bilateral trade between
Tanzania and the United States grew from USD 228 million in 2020 to USD 770
million in 2024. U.S. exports to Tanzania reached USD 566 million, while Tanzanian
exports to the United States increased nearly fivefold to USD 204 million over
the same period. U.S. foreign direct investment has also strengthened, rising
from USD 12.3 million in 2020 to USD 40 million in 2023, with cumulative U.S. FDI
now exceeding USD 1 billion across energy, infrastructure, agribusiness, and
digital technology.
“These numbers attest to a deepening partnership and the mutual benefits
we continue to harness,” the Vice President said. “Enhanced cooperation is
stimulating growth, creating jobs, and advancing sustainable development.”
Vision 2050: An Ambitious, Inclusive Growth Agenda
Looking ahead, Dr. Mpango outlined Vision 2050, Tanzania’s long-term strategy
to build a modern, inclusive, and innovative economy on course toward the USD
1 trillion milestone. Over the next five years, the Government aims to mobilize
approximately USD 185 billion in strategic investments focused on infrastructure,
industrialization, and human capital.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS BULLETIN
July – September 2025

A flagship of this agenda is the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR)—a
2,561-kilometre network interlinking Tanzania with Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi,
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo—designed to lower logistics costs
and enhance Tanzania’s role as a regional trade and transport hub. Special
Economic Zones and industrial parks complement this effort by providing
serviced land, reliable utilities, and streamlined facilitation.
Priority Sectors for U.S. Partnership
The Vice President invited U.S. investors to explore opportunities aligned with
Tanzania’s comparative advantages and regional market access under the
African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA):
Digital Economy: Internet penetration has risen markedly over the past five
years—from about 13% to 60%. Mobile money is a key driver, with annual
transactions exceeding USD 75 billion, approaching 90% of national GDP.
Fintech innovators, including home-grown firms such as NALA, illustrate the
sector’s dynamism and scope for partnerships in payments, cybersecurity,
data infrastructure, and digital services.
Smart Agriculture and Agro-Processing: With 44 million hectares of arable
land, Tanzania is prioritizing climate-smart agriculture, precision technologies
(including AI-enabled solutions and drones), irrigation, storage, and value-
addition to strengthen food security and export competitiveness.
Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals: Opportunities span pharmaceutical
manufacturing, medical equipment, and health-delivery systems. Tanzania
offers a strategic base for serving the East African Community market of
roughly 300 million people and for wider AfCFTA-enabled expansion.
Tourism and Infrastructure: Tourism continues to grow, attracting over 2 million
visitors annually and generating USD 3.37 billion in revenue. Iconic destinations—
including the Serengeti and the Zanzibar Archipelago—pair with upgraded
airports, roads, and the SGR to support sustainable, higher-value tourism and
ancillary services.
Mining and Green Energy: Tanzania hosts critical minerals essential to the
global energy transition, including graphite (Mahenge), nickel (Kabanga), and
significant lithium deposits. In line with the National Mining Policy, the Government
is promoting value-addition, local processing, and the development of battery-
grade materials.
Dr. Mpango encouraged American companies to act decisively amid shifting
global supply chains and the rapid expansion of African markets:
“With our shared commitment to sustainable growth, Tanzania and the United
States can forge an even stronger, mutually beneficial economic alliance. We
warmly welcome American investors to partner with us in building a competitive,
inclusive, and innovation-driven economy.”
As Tanzania advances along its Vision 2050 pathway, the momentum of its
economic diplomacy—anchored in stability, openness, and reform—signals a
future shaped by strategic partnerships and broad-based prosperity.

Tanzania Advances SADC Cooperation Agenda,
Highlights Health Collaboration and Pooled
Procurement
By Ally Kondo
On the margins of the 45th SADC Summit of Heads of State and Government,
the United Republic of Tanzania advanced a broad cooperation agenda with
SADC Member States; spanning infrastructure, trade, and notably, public
health. A central pillar of this agenda is the strengthening of the SADC pooled
procurement mechanism for medicines, medical supplies, and diagnostics,
aimed at improving access, affordability, and quality assurance across the
region.
As part of these efforts, a delegation from Tanzania’s Medical Stores Department
(MSD), led by Ms. Nabila Hemed, Regional Marketing Manager, paid a working
visit to Madagascar’s Central Medical Stores (SALAMA) and held consultations
with its leadership, headed by Board Chair Mr. Claude Eric Ramanantoanina. The
discussions focused on practical avenues to deepen cooperation in support of
resilient and efficient health supply chains.
In her briefing on MSD’s capabilities and performance, Ms. Hemed underscored
Tanzania’s role and through MSD, in coordinating the SADC pooled procurement
initiative on behalf of Member States. She emphasized that fully utilizing this

mechanism will help countries, including Madagascar, secure quality-assured
commodities at competitive prices, reduce transaction costs, and catalyze
regional manufacturing for greater self-reliance.
Both sides exchanged best practices in manufacturing, warehousing, and
distribution of medicines, medical devices, and diagnostics. They agreed that
these mission-critical functions demand efficiency, innovation, and robust
risk management to avoid service interruptions and ensure timely delivery to
patients. The parties therefore emphasized regular knowledge-sharing among
SADC-designated institutions to enhance system performance and outcomes.
Concluding the consultations, MSD invited SALAMA’s leadership to undertake
a technical visit to Tanzania to broaden the scope of dialogue, explore joint
initiatives, and identify concrete steps to operationalize pooled procurement
and other collaborative programmes.
The meeting was also attended by Ambassador Mindi Kasiga, Director of
Government Communications in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and East African
Cooperation, and Ms. Ukundi Domenic, Chief Legal Officer at MSD.

The Minister also welcomed Africa
CDC’s initiatives against sickle cell
disease, noting Tanzania’s readiness
to contribute through the “Building a

Dr. Kaseya applauded Tanzania’s
engagement and cited the country’s
potential to help amplify Africa CDC’s

celebrations with a strong, people-focused delegation spanning defence,
culture, and sport—an engagement to be graced by H.E. Dr. Samia Suluhu
Hassan, President of the United Republic of Tanzania, as Guest of Honour.
A special contingent of the Tanzania People’s Defence Force (TPDF) has arrived
in Moroni to join the national military parade. Led by Captain Mohammed
Maulid Nchimba, the unit paid a courtesy call on the Embassy of the United
Republic of Tanzania, where they were received by Ambassador Saidi Yakubu
and the Defence Attaché, Colonel Abdulrahim Mahmoud Abdallah, who is
coordinating the visit. Ambassador Yakubu conveyed appreciation to the
TPDF leadership—particularly the Chief of Defence Forces, General Jacob
John Mkunda—for honouring the invitation from the Comoros Defence Forces.
He noted that contingents from China and Morocco are also expected to
participate, highlighting the parade’s international character and the strong
defence cooperation between Tanzania and Comoros.

Complementing the ceremonial display, Tanzania’s cultural presence features
celebrated performers Khadija Kopa, the “Queen of Taarab,” and Jay Melody,
both scheduled to headline jubilee concerts. The artists, who enjoy a strong
following among Comorian audiences, paid a courtesy call on Ambassador
Yakubu ahead of the festivities. Their participation underscores cultural
diplomacy as a pillar of bilateral engagement and reflects shared Swahili
heritage across the Western Indian Ocean.
Tanzania’s sporting delegation will also take the ring during exhibition boxing
bouts organized for the celebrations. The team comprises Kassim Mbundwike
and Ezra Mwanjango of the TPDF, alongside Kaimu Kaimu and Samuel Kapungu
from the Amateur Boxing Federation. They are slated to face counterparts
from Madagascar, Réunion, and the host nation, Comoros. Upon arrival, the
boxers called at the Embassy, where arrangements were coordinated by
Colonel Abdallah. Team leader Valerian Lugongo affirmed the athletes are well
prepared and confident of strong performances. In presenting the National
Flag to the contingent, Ambassador Yakubu welcomed the athletes, noted the
historic nature of the jubilee, and expressed confidence that positive results
would bring pride to Tanzanians and friends of Tanzania alike.
Tanzania’s integrated presence—on parade, on stage, and in the ring—
underscores enduring people-to-people ties, maritime and regional security
cooperation, and a shared commitment to celebrate Comoros’ milestone
alongside partners across the region

Fluency as Influence: Reflections on Tanzania’s Public
Diplomacy Under H.E. Dr. Samia Suluhu Hassan
By Mindi Kasiga, ‘ndc’
When H.E. Dr. Samia Suluhu Hassan directed the revision of Tanzania’s Foreign
Policy (2001, 2024 Edition), she did more than refresh a document; she rewired
how we convert culture into capability. The most consequential shift is explicit
in Section 3.7: Kiswahili as an Instrument for Diplomacy. Here in the Ministry,
Kiswahili is no longer treated only as heritage; it is positioned as statecraft,
a diplomatic asset with economic, political, and social potentials as well as
returns. In practice, our diplomacy now speaks in a voice the continent already
understands, used by over 200 million people across East, Central, and Southern
Africa. It is also a language that the world increasingly chooses to learn.
Section 3.7 of Tanzania’s Foreign Policy recognizes Kiswahili’s ascent to a
widely spoken African language and records the United Republic of Tanzania’s
leadership in mainstreaming it as a working language of the AU, SADC, and EAC,
and in catalyzing UNESCO’s designation of 7 July as World Kiswahili Language
Day. It also acknowledges Kiswahili’s role in nationalist struggles, as a language
of identity and dignity, and as a lingua franca. At the same time, it is candid
about gaps: the economic potential of Kiswahili in foreign relations remains
underexploited, limited product ranges, weak branding, and underuse as a
diplomatic language in regional intergovernmental and expert bodies. Hence

the policy’s call to action: explore the economic value of Kiswahili in foreign
relations and champion its use in deliberations of regional, intergovernmental,
and expert bodies, including expanding its place in literature, academia, and
the creative industries.

Rooted in East Africa, Kiswahili now carries across more than fourteen countries,
Tanzania being the leader, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the DRC, South
Sudan, Somalia, Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia, and Comoros. It extends into
Oman and Yemen. Its classroom presence is widening too, with South Africa and
Botswana introducing Kiswahili in schools and Namibia and others weighing
similar steps.
The corollary Policy Objective (3.7.1) is clear, to enhance the exploitation of
economic potentials of Kiswahili and its use in diplomatic relations. Through
Policy Statements (3.7.2) the Government is committed to exploit the economic
potentials of Kiswahili in foreign relations and to promote its utilization as
Africa’s lingua franca and a diplomatic language in regional and international
intergovernmental and expert bodies.
We reframed language as infrastructure. Our Diplomatic Missions now plan
and report against Kiswahili deliverables. From interpretation at meetings;
co-produced media; classroom partnerships; and cultural programming tied
to trade, education, tourism, and health diplomacy. We moved from one-off
events to ecosystems: celebrations paired with curricula; broadcast slots with
training cohorts; goodwill with policy commitments.

July at a glance: As we celebrate Kiswahili this year, here are tangible results
from some of our envoys.
• Zanzibar (7 July): The Ministry received the “Champion of Promoting
Kiswahili Abroad” award. Ambassador Said Shaib Mussa, Deputy Permanent
Secretary, accepted on behalf of the Ministry, recognizing mission-
driven partnerships with teaching centres, mainstreaming of Kiswahili
in communiqués and conferences, and professional interpretation that
elevates its standing, nationally, regionally and globally.
• Abuja, Nigeria (4 & 7 July): Ambassador Selestine Kakele advanced
partnership between Tanzania Broadcasting Cooperation (TBC) and Voice
of Nigeria (VON) programme, with staff exchanges, expanded Kiswahili
programming, and structured training for VON journalists. With BAKITA
and the Tanzanian diaspora, the Embassy continues to coordinate VON’s
Kiswahili classes. On 7 July, the Embassy co-marked Global Kiswahili Day
with EAC missions and UNESCO, highlighting Kiswahili’s role in peace,
cohesion, and development across West Africa.
• Stockholm, Sweden (5 July): Ambassador Mobhare Matinyi convened 500+
participants for a Nordic celebration that paired culture with policy. Hon.
Nyamko Sabuni, former Swedish Minister for Gender Equality, delivered
remarks in Kiswahili, underscoring the language’s practical value in Europe’s
multicultural and commercial settings.

• Ntsoueni, Ngazidja (Union of the Comoros): Ambassador Saidi Yakubu and
Education Minister Bacar Mvoulana agreed to advance consultations to
introduce Kiswahili in Comorian schools, operationalizing H.E. the President’s
offer of teachers and learning materials, a pathway from community use to
curriculum and potential official-language status.
• Harare, Zimbabwe (11 July): Ambassador (CP) Suzan Kaganda co-led the
Fourth Kiswahili Language Day at the Museum of African Liberation, themed
“Kiswahili for Peace and Solidarity.” With Hon. Amb. Frederick Shava linked
language learning to social cohesion and development; Ambassador
Kaganda traced Kiswahili’s role from liberation networks (ZANU-PF, FRELIMO,
SWAPO, ANC) to today’s integration agenda.
Additionally, other efforts by the Ministry included: expanding simultaneous
interpretation into Kiswahili at regional meetings; seeding curriculum pilots with
universities and cultural institutes; producing digital learning content (subtitled
clips, micro-lessons) for youth audiences; and coordinating with tourism and
creative-industry stakeholders so Kiswahili events drive exchanges, bookings,
and co-productions.

Turning policy into practice: lines of effort
1. Diplomatic language of record: Increase the share of AU/SADC/EAC
sessions providing Kiswahili interpretation and circulate Kiswahili versions
of speeches, joint statements, and concept notes.
2. Education pipelines: Build a continental Kiswahili Teaching Corps and
certification track; deploy digital tools (subtitling, dubbing, adaptive testing)
to meet learners on mobile platforms.
3. Media consortia: Scale co-productions with African public broadcasters;
syndicate Kiswahili alongside English/French to normalize bilingual
consumption.
4. Creative-economy branding: Treat Kiswahili as an economic product
with right package standards, glossaries, and IP for film, music, gaming,
podcasts, and ed-tech; co-market with tourism, higher education, and
health services.
5. Measurement and incentives: Track access (meetings interpreted; texts
translated), adoption (channels and schools using Kiswahili), audience
(reach/engagement), and outcomes (exchanges, scholarships, agreements
catalyzed).
Based on the mandated given to the Ministry, it is our firm belief that a language
policy that lives abroad pays dividends at home. Negotiations are faster when
more actors engage meaningfully; markets open when content is discoverable
in Kiswahili; youth employability rises when media and education demand
certified skills; and national brand equity grows when partners meet Tanzania
in a language that is authentically ours yet broadly theirs.
A personal reflection
As the first woman to lead the Ministry’s strategic communications at
Ambassadorial rank, I have learned that who tells the story shapes who feels
invited. It is also true that how we tell it decides who understands. It is also
important to note that as Tanzanians, with Kiswahili we feel welcomed before
we negotiate, and we reciprocate. Kiswahili allows an AU commissioner, a
Nordic investor, and a West African journalist to meet Tanzania in a shared
register of respect and clarity.
President Samia’s revision gives us a clear mandate: exploit the economic
potential of Kiswahili and promote it as Africa’s lingua franca and a diplomatic
language. This July 7/7 campaign, driven by Ambassadors Said Shaib Mussa,
Selestine Kakele, Mobhare Matinyi, Saidi Yakubu, and (CP) Suzan Kaganda
shows this is not rhetoric but a workable architecture. Our task now is to embed
Kiswahili so deeply in diplomacy, media, education, and the creative economy
that 7 July is not just a celebration, but a checkpoint on a year-round roadmap
where fluency becomes influence and culture becomes cooperation.
