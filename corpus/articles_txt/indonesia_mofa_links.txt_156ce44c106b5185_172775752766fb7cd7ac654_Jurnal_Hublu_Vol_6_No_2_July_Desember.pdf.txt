 FOREWORD
The 6th Volume No. 2 , July – December 2021 of this Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri  presents
seven articles that discusses issues ranging from extremism, current development in
Afghanistan, seabed mineral act, perspective on citizen protection as a foreign policy,  halal
certification partnership, and China’s claim in the South China Sea.
On the issue of extremism, the first article overviews the measures made by the US government,
through USAID development assistance, in using soft power to counter violent extremism in
Indonesia through “Harmoni” program. The article suggests that Harmoni is ineffective towards
counterterrorism measures in Indonesia  because it offers less contribution in deradicalizing
ideological militants. The article offers recommendations for Indonesian policymakers to take to
make the program more impactful in containing violent extremism.
The second article discusses challenges faced by Indonesian diplomatic missions abroad in
undertaking early detection of extremism among Indonesian overseas communities following
the Indonesian goverment’s policy to not repatriating  Indonesian foreign terror fighters. The
paper suggests several policy options that can be considered by Indonesian missions that
include do nothing, make inquiries, coordinate with law enforcement , provide shelter (or not) ,
and assist repatriation.
The third article offers analysis on the development in Afghanistan following the coming back of
Taliban in Kabul and took over the government of the Isalmic Republic. The paper analyzes how
the Taliban came to power and how the countries in the region add ress this change. The writer
provides insights on the challenges the Taliban faces and how the region and international
communities responded to the change of power in Afghanistan. As for the Indonesian
government, the article provides policy recommendatio ns in dealing with the political
development of Afghanistan.
Another interesting topic discussed in the fourth article touches upon the absence of seabed
mineral act that create several challenges for the government of Indonesia, especially the
absence to access mining opportunities in the Area . This article suggests that the government
of Indonesia should immediately establish a seabed mineral act, especially in the context of
accelerating Indonesia's participation in the Area . In doing so,  Indonesia must refer to
international law and also the practice of countries in the world by considering their national
interests.
The fifth article discusses the perspective of citizen protection in the realm of diplomacy and
international relations. The article argues that International relations in general are still minimally
capturing the consular relations as an entry point for the protection of citizens abroad. However,
the experience of Indonesia's siding with the protection of Indonesian citizens in international
relations has opened its own interesting perspective . Indonesia not only views overseas citizen
protection as an avenue of consular relations but also as a foreign policy that becomes a
national priority.

iv

The sixth article explores on the opportunities and challenges if Mutual Recognition Agreement
(MRA) on halal certification  is made between Indonesia and European countries.  The study
finds that it would be mutually beneficial for Indonesia and partner country in Europe if an MRA
on Halal Certification is  established. However, up until the article is written, no single MRA has
been made. The articles suggests for Indonesian government to start finding ways to establish
MRA so that the potentials and opprotunities can be seized and tapped.
The last article examines the China’s idea of Belt and Road Initiative that connects mainland all
the way to Europe through the concept of “the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road” that starts at the
South China Sea. In order to achieve its ambition, China claims the South Chi na Sea as its
territory through the concept of nine -dash line. This situation might escalate the tension in the
region as other parties might be against China’s move. The paper suggests ASEAN to take
initiatives so that open conflict in the region could be prevented.

Why U.S Development Aid Fails to Counter Violent Extremism in Indonesia:
Learning from Harmoni
F. Bernard Loesi

The USAID has invested its development assistance to facilitate wider use of soft
power to counter violent extremism (CVE) in Indonesia by designing “Harmoni”
program, which will end in 2023. This article studies why development aid, through
Harmoni case a nalysis, is not productive to counterterrorism measures in Indonesia.
This article suggests Harmoni is ineffective because it offers less contribution in
deradicalizing ideological militants, though arguably positive to increase the capacity
building of st ate officials. Harmoni has marginalized two targeted program recipients:
violent radicalized individuals and individuals exposed to radicalism.
After exploring different research on international development and deradicalization
studies, I additionally ar ranged interviews with 17 Indonesian former terrorist convicts,
two government officials, and an activist before verifying my argument. In the end, the
article presents four recommendations on what actions Indonesian policymakers
should take to make future foreign aid deliver more impacts in containing VE.

Early Detection of Extremism in Indonesian Overseas Communities
Dandy F. Soeparan  & Zora A. Sukabdi

Indonesian diplomatic missions abroad have received a new ambit, with the
Government’s recent policy to prevent and counter violent extremism, by not repatriating
Indonesian foreign terror fighters (FTFs).
To help ensure national security and public order  at home, the missions would face a
significant challenge in performing early detection of extremism and its support network
of sympathizers overseas, not only in relation to extraterritoriality but also due to the
growing de-territorialized and networked nature of communities today.
Meanwhile, the impact of Indonesian overseas communities in violent extremism cannot
be underestimated, as overseas support could be linked to recent terrorist incidents in
Indonesia and abroad.
This paper seeks primaril y to investigate the means for detecting indications of
extremism in an Indonesian overseas community, through a case study on the flow of
Indonesian FTFs abroad.
Four external and internal drivers were identified – international patronage, online
activism, domestic militancy, government credibility – as a basis for discussion and the
drawing of four likely scenarios.
This paper suggests several policy options that Indonesian missions can consider.
These options complement each other and include: Do nothing ; make inquiries;

vi

coordinate with law enforcement; provide shelter (or not), and; assist repatriation.
While developing the necessary capability and preparedness, the Ministry and missions
should strengthen synergy with relevant actors and maintain strateg ic positioning as
honest brokers.
Detection should be done with the utmost care, credibility, and discretion, so as to
ensure safe and secure Indonesian overseas communities.

Afghanistan di Bawah Kekuasaan Taliban: Tantangan dan Peran Dunia
Internasional
Sigit Aris Prasetyo & Adam Janitra Valdy Savero

The current political and security developments in Afghanistan are still challenging and
even uncertain. After the withdrawal of US troops and the NATO coalition, the Taliban
seized power from the previous government. This take over was swift and shocked the
international community. The international media outlets took this political development
in Afghanistan as headlines, while scholars, policy makers and diplomats trying to
analyze the future of Afghanistan under the Taliban. The general picture shown is
unrest, security crisis, chaos, uncertainty and fear. This study aims to analyze how the
Taliban came to power and how the countries in the region address this change. This
study is also intended to look at the challenges faced  by the Taliban as the new ruler, as
well as the role the international community can play. In addition, this study also offers
recommendations for Indonesia's foreign policy and what role it can play in relation to
political developments in this country.

Indonesia Seabed Mineral Act: Urgensi dan Arah Pengaturan
Marsudi Triatmodjo, Agustina Merdekawati & Nugroho Adhi Pratama

Indonesia belum memiliki regulasi nasional yang mengatur mengenai Area (seabed
mineral act). Hal ini menimbulkan beberapa permasalahan khususnya berkaitan dengan
terhambatnya peran Indonesia berkaitan dengan akses penambangan di Area.
Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian hukum normatif yang akan merumuskan bagaimana
urgensi dan arah pengaturan seabed mineral act Indonesia di masa mendatang. Hasil
penelitian menunjukan bahwa Indonesia sudah seharusnya segera membentuk seabed
mineral act khususnya dalam rangka  percepatan partisipasi Indonesia di Area.
Mengenai arah pengaturannya sendiri Indonesia harus mengacu pada hukum
internasional dan juga praktik negara -negara di dunia dengan mempertimbangkan pula
kepentingan nasionalnya.

Shifting The Perspective of Citizens Protection from A Consular to A Foreign
Policy: The Indonesia Experience
Mohamad Nurdin

Consular relations are still less covered in the international relations literature, it can be
understood that the political perspective has high appeal in the academic discussion of

vii

international relations. However, consular relations, both historically and in
contemporary terms, still have high relevance in modern international relations
discourse, especially in terms of the involvement of countries that have a high number
of labor-supply abroad in multi -dimensional dynamics in various international fora. The
relevance covers various aspects of employment, immigration, consular affairs, and the
protection of workers abroad in general.
International relations in general are still minimally capturing the consular relations as
an entry point for the protection of citizens abroad. The experience of Indonesia's
siding with the protection of Indonesian citizens in intern ational relations has opened its
own interesting perspective, considering that in efforts to protect Indonesian citizens,
Indonesia not only views it as an avenue of consular relations but also shifts it as a
foreign policy that becomes a national priority . This paper seeks to investigate aspects
of protecting citizens abroad in the study of international relations in general and to
describe Indonesia's experience which presents a perspective on protecting citizens
abroad which has shifted from consular efforts to foreign policy.

Keywords: Consular, foreign policy, protection of citizens.

Kerja Sama Saling Sertifikat Halal antara Indonesia dengan Negara-Negara Eropa:
Potensi, Peluang dan Tantangan
Adkhilni Mudkhola Sidqi & Akmal Salim Ruhana

Undang-Undang No. 33 Tahun 2014 tentang Jaminan Produk Halal (JPH)
mengindikasikan kemungkinan dijalinnya kerja sama saling pengakuan ( mutual
recognition agreement, MRA) antara Indonesia dengan negara lain. Permasalahannya,
sulit menemukan mitra kerja sama yang setara dengan Badan Pengelola JPH
Kementerian Agama di luar negeri. Lalu, bagaimana praktik kerja sama itu diupayakan
selama ini? Apa saja potensi, peluang dan tantangan terwujudnya kerjasama MRA
tersebut?
Riset kualitatif yang mengumpulkan data dari kajian literatur dan wawancara
narasumber di dalam dan luar negeri ini, mencoba mencari jawaban atas dua
pertanyaan tersebut. Data yang terkumpul dianalisis dengan menggunakan
pendekatan intermestic ( international-domestic) yang melihat pertautan dinamika
implementasi UU JPH di dalam negeri d engan urusan internasional, dan sebaliknya.
Dilakukan juga analisis SWOT atas kondisi yang ada, serta studi komparasi untuk
menemukan skema MRA yang cocok untuk Indonesia.
Riset menemukan bahwa hingga artikel ini ditulis belum satu pun MRA atau MoU
terkait sertifikasi halal yang berhasil dibangun. Potensi dan peluang kerja sama belum
cukup dioptimalkan menghadapi tantangannya. Upaya -upaya yang dilakukan pun
masih minim, untuk tidak mengatakan tidak ada sama sekali. Sedangkan potensi dan
peluang ke depan m asih cukup memberi harapan, meski tantangan internal dan
eksternal yang tidak juga sederhana. Perlu penguatan kesadaran faktor intermestik di
dalam mengelola JPH, sehingga upaya penataan (potensi dan peluang) di dalam
negeri, dapat meyakinkan stakeholders di manapun tentang penyelenggaraan
sertifikasi halal di Indonesia. Penguatan potensi dan peluang, pada gilirannya, akan
menggeser tantangan -tantangan yang dihadapi. Salah satunya dengan mengikuti
skema MRA yang homegrown ala Indonesia.

Klaim Wilayah People’s Republic of China atas Laut China Selatan dan 21st
Century Maritime Silk Road: Laut China Selatan sebagai Flashpoint Baru di Asia
Tenggara
Sutadi

People’s Republic of China (China) ingin mewujudkan konsep BRI ( Belt and Road
Initiative) yang akan menghubungkan China dengan Eropa menggunakan jalur laut yang
disebut dengan “21st Century Maritime Silk Road” yang bermula di Laut China Selatan
(LCS) dan berujung di Eropa . Dalam kaitan itu, China memandang bahwa LCS harus
“dimiliki” berdasarkan konsep nine-dash line yang sejatinya bertentangan dengan
Konvensi PBB tentang Hukum Laut Internasional 1982 (UN Convention on the Law of
the Sea/UNCLOS, 1982). Meskipun demikian, Chin a tetap “menduduki” pulau -pulau di
LCS secara sistematis dan konsisten dengan dukungan militer. Memperhatikan perilaku
China, diperkirakan bahwa China nantinya akan membawa klaim wilayahnya atas LCS
ke ICJ ( International Court of Justice ) di Den Haag denga n konsep effective occupation
(pendudukan efektif) atas pulau -pulau tersebut. Strategi China itu didasarkan pada fakta
bahwa ICJ telah menggunakan prinsip tersebut ketika memenangkan Malaysia dalam
sengketa kepemilikan atas Pulau Ligitan dan Pulau Sipadan antara Indonesia dan
Malaysia (2002).
Klaim China di LCS ditentang Amerika Serikat yang tidak ingin kepentingannya atas
freedom of navigation di LCS dihambat oleh China. Amerika Serikat bahkan membentuk
AUKUS untuk menghadapi China.
Perbedaan kepentingan a ntara Amerika Serikat dan China berpotensi menjadikan LCS
sebagai flashpoint baru di Asia Tenggara. Dalam kaitan ini maka ASEAN perlu
mengambil inisiatif untuk mencegah terjadinya konflik terbuka di LCS.

Keywords: USAID, development aid, soft power, violent extremism, harmoni.


INTRODUCTION
There are three widely known approaches
in combating violent extremism (VE): hard
power through security forces, soft power
through the ability to entice and attract, and
smart power as a combination of both. U.S
counterterrorism efforts are known to mainly
invest in military trainings, weapons, and
technology. This article focuses on the role
of soft power, which is necessary to balance
the hard power measures, in addressing VE
in Indonesia. State and non-state actors are
called to assist countries in appl ying this
sort of power in addressing ideological
violence. An in-depth analysis of foreign aid
can be helpful to assess if aid flow can
effectively contribute to counterterrorism
attempts. This article is particularly relevant
because there has not been a dequate
literature studying the intersection of soft
power use in countering violent extremism
(CVE) and international development
studies.

As the world’s largest donor, the U.S aid
program is tied to its foreign policy concerns
and, like other donor co untries, U.S has
some foreign policy and strategic political
considerations in which countries receive
the aid and how much (Haan, 2009: 10–13).

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021

International aid has been one of the U.S
foreign policy pivotal strategies. Under the
Bush administration, for  example, the U.S
initiated Millennium Challenge for African
countries and elsewhere to deliver aid to
those willing to make reforms, combat AIDS
and infectious diseases (Joseph Nye, 2004:
11, 60 –62, 144 –145). Another instance is
during the time of Ethiopi an Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi. No matter how dictatorial the
regime was at the time, the country still
received U.S development aid because of
foreign policy consideration: that the U.S
needed Ethiopia as “a reliable ally in the
War on Terror, where Ethio pia was a
Christian nation in a sea of Islam” (Easterly,
2013: 157).

National security is another important
variable for the U.S to provide development
aid programs for selected countries, where
during the Cold War it was mainly to contain
communism. According to Easterly, National
security consideration in channeling the aid
has increased after the 9/11 tragedy, and
the U.S global interest has since shifted
from containing communism to containing
violent extremism through the global War on
Terror.

The co mmon justification has been that if
soft power could successfully crumble
communism, it can also crumble extremism
with the right strategies. The U.S State
Department is the leading actor in
employing soft power foreign policy, and
USAID is an independent agency under the
department since USAID Director is
coordinating with and reporting to the
secretary of state, no longer to the
president. The State Department, with the
USAID as the prime development agency,
has been the main driver of the diplomatic
motives behind the aid program both during
the Cold War and post 9/11 (Haan, 2009:
30–31). It was the State Department and
USAID that withheld $25 million economic
aid to South Korea unless Seoul started
political and economic reform (Kang, 2002:
99), which be came an effective pressure
until Seoul finally accepted the terms.

After the Cold War, the U.S largely ignored
Southeast Asia, at least until the 9/11
catastrophe.  Promoting a stabilized and
safe region to ensure American national
security interests at home and abroad is the
center of U.S foreign policy in Southeast
Asia. The U.S under President Bush then
started to focus on Southeast Asia after the
9/11, where Indonesia and the Philippines
receive the most attention in the CVE
concerns (Liow, 2017). Was hington
considered the region as the second front in
waging the war against terrorism (Conboy,
2009), thus aiming Southeast Asia as one of
the priorities in U.S global War on Terror
campaign. Since then, U.S political interests

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
3

in Southeast Asia have been consistent
after the 9/11, from George W. Bush
administration to Joe Biden’s: the South
China Sea, part of Indo -Pacific Strategy,
and issues related to VE (which this article
addresses), though with different emphasis
on each administration. U.S . foreign p olicy
engagement has recently been more
nuanced due to the severe impacts of
Covid-19 in the region, via its aggressive
“no strings attached” vaccine diplomacy as
an opening to balance China and restore
influence in the region.

How does the U.S . view terrorism in
Indonesia? Ideologically motivated violence
is still problematic, although Indonesia has
imposed strict policies through detainment
and execution. In the past three years, the
numbers of arrested militants have been
significantly higher than in the first eleven
years of the 2002 Bali bombing 1,  as shown
in table 1. It indicates that harsh methods
cannot end jihadism, and hard power alone
has failed to stop VE.

Table 1: Detained Indonesian Terrosrist

1  As a “celebration” for 9/11 tragedy, Al-Qaeda
sponsored the Bali bombing that took place exactly
one year, one month, and one day after the NY
attacks. The suicide bombings in Bali destroyed 202
lives and injured more than 209. That incident
becomes the most deadly terrorist attack after the
9/11.

Scholars argue that non -coercive strategies
will complement the hard power of security
forces (Koehler and Fiebig, 2019;
Kruglanski et al., 2018: 107). The role of
soft power, or the ability to entice, attract,
and shape the preferences of others to want
what you want (Joseph Nye, 2008: 29, 31)
becomes an appealing alternative in
addressing VE. The U.S has maintained its
3Ds national security strategy, or the
integration of “Defense, Diplomacy, and
Development” in dealing with VE globally.
Advancing the cap abilities of local law
enforcers constitutes a hallmark of U.S
counterterrorism efforts in Indonesia,
nonetheless this article emphasizes the
“development” feature that starts to receive
more attention from U.S policymakers.

On the other hand, one of the  soft power
strategies in dealing with Islamist militants in
Indonesia is through deradicalization, which
is the highlight of this article.
Deradicalization is my theoretical construct
to understand the process of how Islamist

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
4

jihadists abandon their radic al worldview
and conclude that it is not acceptable to use
violence to effect social change (Rabasa et
al., 2010: 1–2). Deradicalization can also be
understood as a process in which people
reject the radical ideology they once
embraced (Doosje et al., 2016 : 82). This
article further studies the role of foreign
development assistance in deradicalization
attempts.

According to the Congressional Budget
Justification, one of U.S priorities for
Indonesia is to help Indonesia contributes to
regional and interna tional peace and
security by countering terrorism and violent
extremism. The State Department (including
USAID) allocated $74 million for global CVE
purposes in the fiscal year 2020. Indonesia
received almost $4.9 million in 2020, or the
third largest reci pient country after Somalia
and Bangladesh 2  . The CVE funding falls
under the Economic Support and
Development Fund (ESDF), although in
practice, the use of soft power to CVE may
also be funded through different categories,
like Democracy, Human Rights, and
Governance. It is noteworthy, however, th at
there is no single U.S agency responsible
for providing aid to counter global VE

because the responsibility is loaded to
different units within the State Department.
Some units under the department
administering CVE are the Bureau of
Counterterrorism and CVE; Bureau of East
Asia and Pacific; Global Engagement
Center; Under Secretary of Public
Diplomacy and Public Affairs office; and
USAID. Consequently, it is challenging to
identify how much the total aid given to the
use of soft power to CVE in Indonesi a. This
article examines one particular CVE on -
going program initiated by USAID
Indonesia: Harmoni.

How does foreign aid contribute to contain
violent extremism in Indonesia? Reflecting
on Harmoni case analysis, this paper
argues that development aid doe s not
contribute to the deradicalization of the
jihadists, although the aid might be useful to
increase the capacity building of state
officials. Harmoni disregards its targeted
groups, which also include former terrorist
inmates. This article examines Harmoni and
assesses it from the perspectives of
deradicalization studies and international
development frameworks.

The paper proceeds as follows. After
presenting the methods, I start the first
section by exploring international literature
on USAID, Harmoni , and deradicalization
studies. Then, I analyze the data I obtained

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
5

from 20 interviews, to validate my argument.
To be clear, I use Harmoni as my case
analysis in generalizing my theory in the
futile use of foreign aid to address VE in
Indonesia. I draw so me conclusions in the
third section, and close the article by
outlining four recommendations to the
Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on
framing more effective soft power strategies
to CVE in the future aid policy formulations.

METHODS
This qualita tive study focuses the main
argument based on a number of
interdisciplinary empirical research on
deradicalization, in addition to literature on
international development studies. I
examine global deradicalization practices,
and construct Harmoni program u sing a
theory of change to explore if the program’s
activities are indeed consistent with the
program’s design and deradicalization
literature.

This article then triangulates the literary
analysis by confirming it to an independent
sample of data I developed after conducting
17 in -depth interviews with former
Indonesian terrorist convicts. I have secured
IRB approval from the University of
Washington Human Subjects Division in
conducting the research. The semi -
structured interviews took place from May
2020 to May 2021 through video meetings
and phone calls, which became my primary
data collection tool. I used a snowball non -
random purposive sampling when recruiting
the seventeen former militants. I additionally
held elite interviews (Lamont, 2015: 84) with
2 Indonesian Counter -Terrorism Agency
(BNPT) officials, and one activist from
Search for Common Ground -Indonesia. I
used open -ended questions when
interviewing the respondents, like: “Did you
receive any intervention programs? If so,
please explain”, or “ What prompted you to
renounce violence?”. I then followed up with
probes to capture informants’ specific views
on what may deradicalize violent militants.

I transcribed all the interviews and carefully
reviewed each narrative before employing
thematic content analysis (Neuendorf,
2017). When analyzing the empirical data, I
identified some relevant key themes, like
profiles and triggers of deradicalization,
which became my preliminary coding
strategies. Then, I checked related quotes
from the interview transcripts about
experiences that have successfully
deradicalized them.

DISCUSSION
This section discusses US development
assistance in containing VE, Harmon i
program design, and the concept of
deradicalization.

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021

For Washington, violent extremism
influences the order within states, which
matters to global security, as illustrated in
Yemen, Syria, Afghanistan, or Pakistan. U.S
foreign policy places USAID and other types
of foreign aid as a critical factor to indirectly
reduce terrorism by lowering poverty and
increasing the quality of education and
health. USAID enforces the use of soft
power in projecting its worldwide
development assistance. America offers its
foreign aid to provide incentives and
resources to the host countries to adopt
policies that are in line with the U.S
interests, which in the context of terrorism is
to fight extremist groups domestically
(Shahzad et al., 2020: 2). USAID has
decided to in vest in the development
response to address violent extremism and
insurgency due to the rising challenges
posed by violent extremism. The foreign aid
agency is obligated to secure national
security interests by supporting stability
abroad as well as reduci ng threats to
Americans at home.3

In the case of Pakistan, for instance, the
country has become a major victim of VE in
South Asia and there has been a flow of
USAID and other official development

3

/1866/10.6.2019-CVE-Policy.pdf, retrieved on

assistance to Pakistan just to control
terrorism. Shahzad concluded that the use
of foreign a id as a counterterrorism tool in
Pakistan is vague. His finding is based on
Pakistan’s sample of annual data over the
period of 1985-2016, which was divided into
pre-9/11 and post -9/11. The data utilized
three variables: the number of total terrorist
attacks; a total of U.S aid, loans, and grants;
the amount of official development
assistance, military expenditures, and GDP
per capita.  Furthermore, USAID suggested
that the foreign aid had insignificant impacts
on counterterrorism policies for Pakistan
(Shahzad et al., 2019).

Similarly, U.S assistance has done little to
improve the rule of law and government
effectiveness in Afghanistan. Government
corruption and lawlessness were fueling
Taliban insurgency despite of the nearly 3.9
billion USAID has spent in Afghanistan
since 2002. The corruption remained,
although USAID became the major provider
of assistance and capacity building
programs to promote the rule of law.
USAID’s micromanagement in controlling
the projects and their implementation, as an
accountability undertaking to the U.S
Congress, turned to be inoperable
(Swenson, 2017). And today, Taliban
forces, whom the U.S tried so hard to
defeat, have completely taken over
Afghanistan.

In another part of the world, Daniel Aldrich
(2014) argues that U S soft power and
development programs to CVE in Mali had
no casual connection with behavioral
outcomes. His conclusion is derived after
conducting randomized control trials (RCTs)
in two similar towns and 200 respondents in
Mali. One town received USAID CV E
programming for up to 5 years, and the
other was not. USAID programming in the
two cities in Mali focused on radio
broadcasting for peacebuilding, capacity
building for local governments, micro -
finance, and educational trainings.
Unfortunately, Aldrich’s  quantitative
research found out there was little
difference between the two groups in terms
of their cultural identities and attitudes
towards the West. Even so, soft
counterterrorism bolstering in development
should still be envisioned as a strategic
development defense activity in Africa
(Miles, 2012: 27).

Scholars argue poverty, income inequality,
corruption, unemployment, ineffective
governance, the weak rule of law, and
limited access to education and health
amenities are significant factors for
grievances that attract terrorism (Adelaja
and George, 2020; Shahzad et al., 2019).
The U.S government seems to realize this
argument and has delegated USAID, not
the military, to address terrorism through
development aid. As mandated in 2020
USAID’s policy fo r CVE, the agency
currently attempts to foster resilience in
partner countries by strengthening the
capacities of local institutions to counter VE
threats. One of USAID’s development
strategies to contain terrorism is by
engaging development assistance tha t can
have real impacts in reducing VE. USAID
has shifted its mission from countering
specific grievances that trigger terrorism, to
strengthening the resilience in partner
countries to prevent and eradicate violent
extremism (USAID, 2020b). However, it is
not entirely clear what makes this new
mission different than previous policy
practices. Although USAID’s current mission
appears new, the donor institution has long
applied similar principles globally as
indicated in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Mali:
empowering host countries to achieve self -
reliance to address terrorism.

USAID interprets ‘self -reliance’ as country’s
ability to plan, finance, and apply solutions
to address its own development challenges.
For the Indonesian case, USAID had three
main Development Objectives (DO) to reach
in the 2013 to 2020 period, and the first
Development Objective (DO I) was to
achieve democratic governance and more
strengthened security. Improving key
institutions’ ability to counter extremism was
one of the four key f ocuses in DO I (USAID,

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021

2020a: 14). USAID attempted to support the
Indonesian government’s interests in
promoting tolerance and pluralism by
reducing the communities’ vulnerability to
VE influence in order to degrade the drivers
of conflict and intolerance.

For USAID, the intended resilience against
VE can be more realistic if the Indonesian
communities and key institutions have the
necessary awareness and tools to sustain
tolerance and counter the appeal of violent
ideological organizations. Secondly,
Indonesia should ensure that effective
systems should be established to nurture
and reintegrate former violent militants. The
donor institution formulates its programs in
containing VE in Indonesia on these
understandings, and has partnered with the
Indonesian government, particularly the
Ministry of Law and Human Rights.

USAID views that intolerance and VE can
reduce the quality of democracy in
Indonesia and eventually threaten
Indonesia’s economic goals and socio -
political stability. Consequently, in the l atest
2020-2025 Country Development
Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) in Indonesia,
USAID maintains countering terrorism as its
DO I to achieve effective and strengthened
democratic governance. Combating
intolerance, terrorism, and building
community resilience against extremist
ideologies will support U.S foreign policy in
fostering Indo -Pacific Strategy (USAID,
2020a). Thus, American national interest
through USAID is to channel development
aid to help the Indonesian government
surpass terrorism.

USAID’s role is to work as an advisor to the
Indonesian government and civil societies to
increase their capacity to plan, finance, and
apply their own solutions to address
challenges of ideological violence. One of
USAID’s on -going CVE programs in
Indonesia is Harmoni.

Unpacking Harmoni Program Design
This section discusses the program design
of Harmoni, which is mainly obtained from
three interviews with Indonesia’s Search for
Common Ground country representative
and two National Counter Terrorism Agency
(BNPT) officials.

Harmoni is a five -year proje ct and USAID
allocates $24.3 million for the period of 2018
to 2023. The project’s amount is considered
relatively small compared to Indonesian
CVE programs of other State Department
units. USAID initiated Harmoni in August
2018, with the purpose to increa se the
resilience of key Indonesian institutions and
segments of society against the rise of
violent extremism in Indonesia. In line with
USAID’s philosophy for combating terrorism

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
9

in Indonesia, Harmoni focuses on
community resilience, rehabilitation of
extremists, and migrant worker resilience.
USAID has coordinated with the Directorate
General of Correction, under the Indonesian
Ministry of Legal and Human Rights, in
implementing Harmoni. Nonetheless, the
focal point institution organizing the use of
soft power strategies towards violent
extremism is the National Counter Terrorism
Agency (BNPT), which is not the leading
agency in Harmoni.

USAID has selected Management Systems
International (MSI) as the prime awardee to
implement Harmoni, which collaborates with
Love Frankie (for strategic communication
purposes) and Search for Common Ground
Indonesia (or known as “Search”) as the
sub-prime awardees. Harmoni is the first
USAID - Search collaboration, as the NGO
usually works in different CVE programs
with other bureaus in the State Department.
This pattern links to Burger’s three -level
hierarchy: bilateral government and aid
donor, which subcontracts to international
and national non-private organizations, and
subcontracts the project to the more local
organizations (Burger et al., 2018). Harmoni
has three components of intermediate result
(IR)4 , as described in Table 2.

A consortium of non -government entities
implements Harmoni program and they
agree for MSI to focus on the larger issue in
the first intermediate result, and Search as
the main executing agency that works on
the IR 2. After doing some preliminary
research, the consortium decided to drop
the IR 3 since it has a low -risk of violent
radicalization. IR 1 focuses to preventing VE
and does not directly deal with terrorist
inmates. Since the use of soft power in
deradicalizing religious militants primarily
deals with rehabilitation and reintegration, I
concentrate on Harmoni’s design in the IR
2.

Search has collaborated with other
Indonesian civil society organizations
(CSOs) in doing IR 2, such as C -Save,
Center for Detention Studies (CDS),
Institute for Internat ional Peace (YPP), and
International NGO Forum on Indonesian
Development (INFID). One of the
collaborations is when Search and CDS
produced psychometry measurement tools
to assess the level of violence, recidivism,
and grievances of the observed Islamist
militants. Search’s Program Manager,
Wijaksana, is convinced that the tools have
helped prison counselors working for the
probation office to have the capacity on how
to assess the militants. However, the tools
are not for the correctional officers, as they
are not the main target of Search’s work.
Section Head of American Affairs at the
National Counter Terrorism Agency (BNPT)5
explained that IR 2 intends to provide a
better system for radicalized individuals and
their families' reintegration process. In o rder
to achieve a better system, the designed
activities should increase the capacities and
collaboration among relevant stakeholders,
and improve conducive circumstances for
rehabilitation and reintegration (R&R)
processes.

Next, the priorities of the IR 2 in 2021 are to
strengthen the knowledge of government
officials and practitioners on R&R; support
R&R in the available facilities; strengthen
the role of communities and CSOs in R&R;
and strengthen public communication on
R&R. To achieve these prioriti es, Search
has to intensify coordination and advocacy
in designing R&R policies, and encourage
the National Plan of Countering Violent
Extremism in the R&R context.

Search has traditionally applied four other
CVE activities years earlier but decided to
proceed and integrate them into the new
Harmoni umbrella. The first activity is
BRIDGE (Building the Resilience of
Indonesian Girls Against VE), held in
September 2019. The program aimed to
deepen participants’ understanding of VE

messaging application on December 13 and 14, 2020.

and equipped them with ski lls to counter
and prevent provocative messages in
radicalizing the public. Second is a two -day
training for the Directorate General of
Correction on public communication and
media handling, organized in July 2019. The
third is Training of Trainers for Wom en
Peacebuilders, which aimed to internalize
the Common Ground Approach to the
women participants for peacebuilding
purposes. The last program is peace
journalism training for media and journalists.
Peace journalism trained media
professionals to address h ate speech,
misinformation, acts of discrimination, and
violent messages that have been successful
in recruiting new Islamist radicals.

In sum, USAID’s platform in countering VE
using soft power in Indonesia has come up
with some programs, and Harmoni is  one
longer-term program that remains until
2023. It is evident that Harmoni represents
the epicenter of USAID’s cooperation
development strategy to contain violent
radicalism in Indonesia. Can it be concluded
that Harmoni is a successful project to
rehabilitate and reintegrate the radicals in
Indonesia? How can USAID and Indonesian
decisionmakers certain that programs like
Harmoni that foster capacities of prison
counselors, can be an effective method to
deradicalize and reintegrate former terrorist
inmates as mandated in the IR 2 activities?
The answers are found to be difficult, yet it
is helpful to examine existing international
field research and empirical data in
deradicalization studies that the next section
discusses.

A Glimpse of Deradicalization Studies
Deradicalization is the central component of
soft power strategies in dealing with violent
radicals. Deradicalization is also
academically interpreted as reintegration,
rehabilitation, or re -education, which
basically describes the process of turning
from endorsing and using violence to
abstinence from violent behaviors.
Deradicalization studies have unfortunately
been under -researched compared to
radicalization studies (Koehler 2017, 4;
Anne-Sophie Ponsot, Cateline Autixier
2018, 2) for many reasons like l ack of
empirical data and access limitation. State
and non -state actors alike create
deradicalization programs without much
theoretical backing behind the decisions,
making it essential for them to establish a
solid basic knowledge and toolkit for
deradicalization before applying for the
programs. This article seconds Koehler’s
narrative that deradicalization -related tools
and programs are best understood as
intervention (Koehler, 2017: 115).

This section limits to merely two credible
deradicalization res earch that obtain their

Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021

primary data collection through interviews,
participant observation, field experiments,
and surveys with the radicalized and
deradicalized individuals, as well as
professionals who have been working in
terrorism for years. These stu dies
investigate some strategies on how to
successfully deradicalize religious militants
based on their empirical findings.

The first thesis comes from Rabasa of
RAND Corporation that studied intervention
programs in 10 countries in the Middle East
(Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Iraq), Southeast
Asia (Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia,
Thailand), and Europe (UK, Holland,
Denmark). Rabasa a nd his co -authors
conclude from the cases around those
regions that prison interventions can only
succeed when encompassing affective,
pragmatic, and ideological components,
which need to be proceeded after their
release. Affective elements involve family
and friends; pragmatic deals with work and
compensation; while ideological component
relates to religion, ideology, and normative
elements. Furthermore, the authors argue
that ideology plays a central role in
deradicalization attempts. The militants are
grieved due to a number of different factors,
like: repressions against Muslims, the
absence of Islamic law, or American
occupation in the Middle East; but it is the
ideology that brainwashes them into
becoming violent jihadists. It is also the
ideology that  helps recruitment, legitimizes
violence, and maintains group solidarity
(Rabasa et al., 2010). Additionally, the
success of intervention programs would be
much more likely when continued after the
terrorist inmates are released, or also
recognized as aftercare programs.

Other scholars proposed other factors like
social and psychological rehabilitations
(Rohan Gunaratna, 2020) for the released
violent extremists; social media platforms
(Koehler, 2014); and government CVE
policies (LaFree and Freilich, 2 019) toward
intolerant messages expressed by religious
figures may contribute to the success of
deradicalization endeavors.

The second study is by social psychologist
Arie Kruglanski. He and his team had
conducted hundreds of field research with
violent extremists in more than 20 countries
in the Middle East, South and Southeast
Asia, Europe, and North America. They
synthesize different empirical evidence by
introducing the 3N framework (Needs,
Narratives, Network) that can radicalize and
deradicalize terrorists (Arie Kruglanski et al.
2019). For deradicalization efforts in the 3N
model, the planners must identify the needs
of the detainees. The needs are factors that
may trigger deradicalization process, and
the needs can differ from one militant to

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
13

another. Some may feel disillusioned by
terrorist actions and strategies, some may
feel burned -out, receive negative social
sanctions and stigma, start a family, lose
social support, get disappointed about the
effects of violence, unmet expectations, and
so forth.

Then, rehabilitation and reintegration
programs must address the radical
ideological narratives that justify violence to
achieve ends. It is important to focus on a
counter-narrative that stresses moderation,
tolerance, and indoctrinate participants wi th
the right ideology that prohibits the use of
violence. The last is that interventions must
sever ex -terrorist convicts from their
previous social network and replace them
with new groups like NGOs and community
or religious groups that support moderatio n
and non-violence.

There are some cohesions on Rabasa and
Kruglanski’s deradicalization frameworks.
First, state and non -state actors place
violent extremists as the direct beneficiaries
of the intervention programs. Second,
deradicalization should involve, or counter,
the ideology that drives them to be violent in
the first place. Third, interventions that
include vocational trainings, psychological,
financial, and social supports need to be
systemized both when they are st ill in
prisons and after they get released through
aftercare programs. Therefore, it is crucial
to explore if different USAID development
programs in CVE have satisfied the findings
of available empirical research as
evidenced in Rabasa and Kruglanski.

Data Analysis – Harmoni
The first, and most important, assumption of
USAID and its implementing CSOs when
designing Harmoni is to strive for a change.
This article uses Gugerty’s framework on
the theory of change to better understand
the construction of Har moni’s missions for
making a change. A theory of change is a
map of an intervention program and the
social changes it seeks to create (Gugerty
and Karlan, 2018: 30), and the theory helps
organizations articulate how their programs
work to produce the chang es they seek.
Theory of change can also help monitor the
on-going progress of the intervention
program.

The first step is to define what the problem
and intended results are. Harmoni is
designed to address the problem of the
delicate resilience of key In donesian
institutions and segments of society against
the rise of violent extremism in Indonesia.
Based on table 2, the intended result of
Harmoni is to attain successful rehabilitation
and reintegration, or what academic
literature deems as successful
interventions. Based on that table, Harmoni

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
14

is mandated to initiate activities aimed at
violent radicalized individuals (former
terrorist inmates and returnees from Syria)
and those exposed to radicalism doctrines
to generate a change to the problem. Table
2 shows that the two targeted participant
groups are former terrorist inmates and
returnees from Syria.
Table 3 shows the construction of activities
and the effects of 2018 -2020 IR 2 based on
the information obtained from Search and
BNPT.

In line with USAID’s platform, search major
strategy for Harmoni is to increase the
capacity of state officials in order to achieve
better prison management. USAID and the
implementing organizations on the ground
allow capability principles in mobilizing the
initiative: expanding participatio n
capabilities, deliberating principles,
catalyzing partnerships, and learning mutual
accountability (Apsan Frediani et al., 2014).
The capability approach in international
development encourages the human
capability perspective that links to CVE
project p lanners and evaluators, and it
seems Harmoni has responded positively to
the capability approach for government
officials. Search mentioned how Indonesian
probation, parole officers, and social
workers did not have the necessary skills to
manage terrorist and ex -terrorist inmates
and how the officers were satisfied to
participate in the trainings. Anyhow, there is
little evidence of the long-term effectiveness
of this sort of participation in improving
prison management and impacting terrorist
and ex-terrorist inmates (Cleaver, 1999: 1).

Nonetheless, the construction of the theory
of change in the table 3 shows that the
activities have marginalized the only groups
Harmoni aims at violent radicalized
individuals and those exposed to radicalism
doctrines. USA ID has additionally
overlooked the target of recipient stated in
the IR 2: former terrorist inmates (see table
2), let alone ISIS returnees. This
inconsistency is surprising given the clear
platform of Harmoni’s IR 2.

Another contradiction is when Harmon i’s
program activities do not accommodate its
strategy to nurture and reintegrate former
terrorist convicts. Subsequently, it cannot be
suggested that Harmoni directly helps
Indonesia combat intolerance, terrorism,
and building resilience against the influ ence
of radical ideologies. In addition, preparing
current and former terrorist inmates as
direct program beneficiaries would be
consistent with Rabasa and Kruglanski’s
deradicalization frameworks. It is
unfortunate that this specific group is left out
in Harmoni’s capability building activities
and does not receive any aftercare
interventions.

 In terms of deradicalization techniques,
Rabasa and Kruglanski argue that effective
CVE needs to address the ideology that
drives the extremists to be violent. On  the
other hand, Search intentionally refuses to
involve theological dialogs and avoids
confronting the jihadists’ radical ideology.
For Search, confronting ideology may
generate resistance among the extremists.
Again, Search’s strategy is to “educate”
state workers and let them deal with the
current and former terrorist detainees. It is

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
16

puzzling how Harmoni’s trainings for
capacity building can improve prison
management that contributes to
deradicalization.

To measure the impacts of the programs,
Search utilizes its internal Design,
Monitoring and Evaluation Protocol (DME
Protocol) that ensures each step fulfills the
project quality assurance. The protocol
analyzes if the program design of the
activities corresponds to the overall
objective. The protocol also allows Search
to recognize if projects end in the outputs
only or successfully deliver the outcomes.
Nevertheless, Search is unable to measure
the projects’ impacts for the jihadists, and
can only analyze the impacts “probably after
ten years from now”.6

The next section examines how 17
Indonesian former terrorist convicts got
deradicalized.

Data Analysis – Formers’ Perspectives
This article has established 17 cases of
former Indonesian terrorist inmates. They,
all males, tended to be relatively y oung
when involved in violent jihadism, averaging
24 years old with an outlier of 43 years. One
respondent graduated elementary, one from
middle school, and four earned their

focal individuals, are high school gra duates.
The respondents received different
sentences, ranging from eleven months to
fifteen years, and they generally become
entrepreneurs after serving their time. The
profiles of the respondents are summarized

47% never experienced interventions while
they were detained. However, all admitted
receiving var ious interventions once they
got out of prisons (aftercare programs). The
interventions varied depending on prison
and geographical locations, but generally
included religious dialogues, family
outbounds, vocational trainings, personal
supports, seminars, informal lunches, social
gatherings, or classes on some subjects at
BNPT’s Sentul facility. All formers
mentioned a range of state institutions that
approached them after their release: local
police (including Densus), army, BNPT,
Ministry of Social Affair s, and intelligence.
Three of the ex -jihadists additionally
mentioned how some civil society
organizations improved their vocational
skills and facilitated social reconciliation with
families of terrorist victims.

30% respondents who received
interventions from BNPT explicitly criticized
the state agency for its fruitless programs;
which corresponds to Hwang’s premise that
BNPT’s deradicalization programs are often
assessed as “poorly conceived and
implemented, disconnected from the actual
needs of the ta rget population” (Hwang,
2018: 150).

The focal individuals described they feel
humanized and significant when authorities
involved them in different intervention
programs. Eight cases collaborated wi th
authorities to deradicalize other jihadists
and propagate moderation among terrorist
inmates, Islamic students, and other general
audiences. All respondents do not mind
persuading other militants in their
community to renounce an Islamic state in
Indonesia. Some informants explained: “I
will be happy to help the police to talk with
other radicals so that they can turn away
from their extreme views.” At least seven
respondents are active in Persadani and
Gema Salam, two organizations managed
by former ter rorist inmates that strive to
embrace and deradicalize Islamist militants.

Having the voice of the formers to influence
imprisoned and released jihadists can likely
be more credible and effective than the
government’s. Persadani and Gema Salam
members confirmed: “I have witnessed how
they trust us more than the government,
because in many cases they still regarded
the state as an infidel.” Rabasa
complemented this by arguing that
extremists may find greater credibility to the
ex-jihadists who played a sign ificant role in
their previous organizations (Rabasa et al.,
2010: 36).

In addition to receiving interventions, four
cases des cribed how they started to doubt
their radical views after experiencing
positive relationships and treatments from

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
18

prison and police officials. However, it is
unknown if the mentioned state officials
have received any capacity-building training
from USAID or other institutions. It is also
unclear if the four respondents would still be
deradicalized if they never received any
intervention programs. Interestingly, this
parallels with the latest RAND empirical
research on violent extremism in America
that ques tioned 36 former white
supremacists, jihadists, and their families.
RAND found out that planned
or coincidental exposure to kindness and
understanding by group members that the
individuals came to hate for ideological
reasons, become the most common feature
of successful interventions in the U.S
(Brown et al., 2021: 65). Below (table 5) are
the intervention trajectories that the17
formers experienced.

The empirical data suggests correlations
with Rabasa and Kruglanski’s findings that
the 17 formers have become direct
beneficiaries of the intervention programs.
Similar to the scientific findings, the
Indonesian programs also include religious
discussions, vocational training,
psychological, financial, and social support
during their imprisonment and stretched out
after release.

CONCLUSION
The literature reviewed in this article
indicates that USAID’s efforts to counter
violent extremism in different r egions have
little impact on controlling terrorism. A
similar outcome can also be found in
Indonesia. This article argues that the use
of soft power can effectively deradicalize
militants through different interventions, but
USAID does not have a direct co ntribution
to achieving so.

Harmoni likely increases the resilience of
key Indonesian institutions and segments of
society, especially women and journalists.
Nevertheless, particular trainings, like Public
Communication, Media Handling, and ToT
for Women Peacebuilders, do not serve the
purpose of Harmoni’s objective. Those
trainings do not necessarily provide the
capability to deal with actual violence and
conflict, since the beneficiaries have not
shown proven abilities in applying the
knowledge and skil ls acquired from the
trainings to real CVE situations.

Organizing trainings in Indonesia are not
very costly, but it will be more valuable if the
funding can be allocated to address the ex -
terrorist convicts through empirically proven
interventions. For an illustration, a cost for a
two-day training or seminar that holds 50
participants (including catering their
breakfasts and lunches), 10 resource
persons, and is organized in a four -star
hotel in Indonesia would not probably cost
more than $25,000. With that amount of
money, agencies could provide
comprehensive one -year aftercare
programs for 25 militants and their families.
Deradicalized terrorists can create multiplier
effects by deradicalizing other jihadists if
decision-makers can systematically
empower them. Search estimates there are
less than 2,500 detained and released
Indonesian violent extremists, so it will be
more productive for Harmoni, and other
CVE programs in this matter, to focus on
this specific group of people.

It is not uncommon that NGOs promise
things but rarely deliver, which creates a
gap between donors’ expectations and local
realities (Swidler and Watkins, 2009: 1192).
Harmoni has not really satisfied important
international development principles, like
transparency, accountabili ty, monitoring

evaluation, and impact evaluation, though
Harmoni accommodates the capability
approach for some state officials. From the
perspective of soft power, Harmoni does not
contribute to the deradicalization of violent
extremists. This occurs because USAID has
different philosophical objectives from
empirically established deradicalization
studies in terrorism. The two perspectives
are yet to merge, which may explain why
there is no academic literature so far that
investigates the intersection of de velopment
assistance and the use of soft power to
counter violent extremism.

Nevertheless, if the objective or need
assessment of Harmoni is for rehabilitation
and reintegration of violent extremists in
Indonesia, the implementing agencies
should design  program activities, outputs,
and outcomes that satisfy the objective. The
agencies should refer to credible (and pretty
rare) deradicalization research when
articulating how their programs should work
to produce the changes they seek.

Lastly, the empir ical evidence of the 17
former Indonesian jihadists suggests they
have directly received intervention
programs, either while they were still in
prisons, out of prisons, or both. In other
words, they have become the direct
beneficiaries of the interventions , which
does not materialize in Harmoni. This also
suggests intervention programs that
incorporate affective (involving family and
social network), pragmatic (work,
compensation, practicality), and ideological
variables (religion, normative) have
contributed to deradicalizing them. This is
an approach that donors and their
implementing agencies tend to ignore.

RECOMMENDATIONS
After examining USAID’s Harmoni program
design and analyzing it from the
deradicalization and international
development perspectives, this article
proposes four recommendations to modify
foreign development aid directing at CVE to
be more impactful and attain more
strengthened community resilience.

First, a directorate at the Indonesian
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) sh ould
specifically use soft power to CVE as its
routine program. A dedicated MFA unit is
principal, and Directorate of Public
Diplomacy or Directorate of International
Security and Disarmament should take the
initiative to serve as the leading coordinator
for this specific concern at the ministry. This
unit should identify and accommodate donor
countries (can be started from MFA’s
interfaith dialog bilateral partners, for
instance) and international agencies like
USAID that aim to apply the use of soft
power in CVE. It will be fruitful if the office

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
21

seeks inputs from other regional
directorates that have identified interests
from different countries, like Australia, Saudi
Arabia, U.S, Singapore (also frequently
praised for its successful interventions),
Denmark, or Germany to get involved in
Indonesian soft counterterrorism. After
identifying the donors that have worked or
shown interest in counterterrorism work in
Indonesia, and after coordinating this
internally, the unit should communicate their
missions an d facilitate them with related
government stakeholders, particularly
BNPT. Establishing a coordinated structure
between donors and the right domestic
institution partners will be worthy. BNPT
should be the significant state partner of this
effort, instead of the Ministry of Legal and
Human Rights.

Second, the donors and BNPT should adopt
deradicalization strategies that are
empirically and scientifically reliable.
Although limited, there is international
empirical literature that investigates
effective i ntervention programs. The
interventions should be directly aimed at
militants and their families through
programs that involve vocational trainings
and financial supports (can be through the
establishment of koperasi, group lending,
financial inclusions, m icrofinance, non-cash
assistance), and provide other day -to-day
facilitations, like helping with the making of
IDs (KTP), BPJS, driving license, the
opening of bank accounts, or obtaining the
available various non -cash social
assistance (like PKH). Other v ariables like
psychological, nationalism, citizenships,
religious, and social components can also
be integrated though they should not be
placed as central agendas. Therefore,
successful interventions must include
careful individual needs assessments and
tailored programs for the beneficiaries.
Seminars in hotels or a few lectures, no
matter how inspiring, are unlikely effective
(Sumpter, 2017: 130).

Third, learning from USAID’s Harmoni,
implementing agencies should empower ex-
violent jihadists as the key agent of change,
instead of prison counselors or social
workers. Government officials should no
longer be the beneficiary of the intervention
works. Former militants play a strategic role
in deradicalizing other terrorists as their
voices are more credibl e in the eyes of the
militants than the voices of those who are
connected to the government, NGOs, or
mainstream religious figures. MFA should
involve organizations run by former
militants, like Persadani, Gema Salam, or
Yayasan Lingkar Perdamaian in a mor e
systemic loop.

One of the most problematic aspects about
current literature and practices of

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
22

deradicalization programs is the lack of
evaluative studies. Therefore, the last
recommendation is that the MFA ensure
local implementing agencies, including
BNPT, perform rigorous studies and include
bottom-up assessment as an inseparable
part of impact evaluation. In other words,
the evaluation should integrate the
recipients' assessment of the received
programs to learn if the executed programs
are indeed ef fective and efficient in
deradicalizing them. The general
assessment should be made open for the
public to access to ensure transparency and
accountability to improve the quality of
services (Kosack and Fung, 2014: 65). If
MFA is willing to take an extra m ile, it
should encourage BNPT, or allow
universities and researchers, to organize
randomized control trials to further test the
efficacy of the interventions. The trials
should encompass treatment groups
(groups receiving intervention programs)
and control  groups (groups without
intervention), so related stakeholders can
determine which interventions that may, or
may not, work. Interventions will mean
nothing without proper impact evaluation.
Even better, MFA, which has the reputation
of being unbiased am ong state
bureaucracies, should be the one who
performs all the evaluative studies.

Simultaneously, MFA should standardize
some indicators to identify if the
beneficiaries are really deradicalized, or
solely exploiting benefits without decent
intentions. As suggested by Rabasa, some
indicators to be considered are: the
recidivism rates of the program rec ipients;
sincerity in providing information about their
former group; willingness to openly
renounce the use of violence; and
enthusiasm to actively participate in
deradicalization efforts to reach out to other
militants.

EARLY DETECTION OF EXTREMISM IN INDONESIAN
OVERSEAS COMMUNITIES

Abstract
Indonesian diplomatic missions abroad have received a new ambit, with the Government’s recent policy
to prevent and counter violent extremism, by not repatriating Indonesian foreign terror fighters (FTFs).
To help ensure national security and public order  at home, the missions would face a significant
challenge in performing early detection of extremism and its support network of sympathizers overseas,
not only in relation to extraterritoriality but also due to the growing de -territorialized and networked nature
of communities today.
Meanwhile, the impact of Indonesian overseas communities in violent extremism cannot be
underestimated, as overseas support could be linked to recent terrorist incidents in Indonesia and abroad.
This paper seeks primaril y to investigate the means for detecting indications of extremism in an
Indonesian overseas community, through a case study on the flow of Indonesian FTFs abroad.
Four external and internal drivers were identified – international patronage, online activism , domestic
militancy, government credibility – as a basis for discussion and the drawing of four likely scenarios.
This paper suggests several policy options that Indonesian missions can consider. These options
complement each other and include: Do nothing ; make inquiries; coordinate with law enforcement;
provide shelter (or not), and; assist repatriation.
While developing the necessary capability and preparedness, the Ministry and missions should
strengthen synergy with relevant actors and maintain strategic positioning as honest brokers.
Detection should be done with the utmost care, credibility, and disc retion, so as to ensure safe and
secure Indonesian overseas communities.

BACKGROUND
In February 2020, President Joko Widodo
announced the Government’s decision to
not repatriate Indonesian nationals who are
foreign terrorist fighters/ FTFs affiliated to
the “Islamic State” terrorist group, in order to
ensure national security and public order in
Indonesia (Se kretariat Kabinet , 2020).
Meanwhile, the National Counter Terrorism
Agency (BNPT) estimated before the
Parliament that the current number of
Indonesian FTFs is around 1,500 people, of
which 800 are abroad, 100 died, 550
deported, and 50 repatriated (CNN
Indonesia, 2021).

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021

The existence of hundreds of Indonesian
FTFs and their potential network of
sympathizers abroad poses a challenge for
Indonesian missions in the discharge of
their diplomatic and consular duties. The
missions now need to monitor and prevent a
security problem from developing, not only
in their accredited countries but also in
relation with In donesia. Indeed, terrorist
attacks involving Indonesian IS -affiliated
deportees such as Surabaya bombings
(2018), Mobile Brigade Headquarters
standoff (2018), and Jolo Cathedral
bombing (2019), served as a potent
reminder on the risks of allowing extremism
to thrive in Indonesian overseas
communities, along with its consequences
to security at home.

 There are significant risks that need to be
anticipated. Indonesian FTFs' previous
travels to IS -controlled areas in Syria were
organized by extremist groups,  exploiting
ease of access from the nearby
international hub of Istanbul (Detikcom,
2021). A small extremist cell has developed
in the Indonesian community in Hong Kong,
enabling fighters to leave for the Middle
East while plotting terror attacks in
Indonesia (IPAC, 2017 : 4). Closer to home,
a survey found that students active in five
out of 10 state universities showed
moderate to high levels of radicalism, in
terms of promoting intolerant beliefs, having
peer support to do so, and were able to
spread radi cal teachings through various
groups on campus (Infid, 2020 : 5 -8).
Similarly, another survey found considerably
high level of religious intolerance –at 30% of
respondents-- among university students in
Indonesia (PPIM UIN Jakarta, 2021).

Indeed, one can a rgue that there are at
least three fundamental shifts taking place
in Indonesian society today: The outbreak of
Covid-19 global pandemic that has eased
the transition to online realm and virtual
communities; the growing rates of Internet
penetration and ga dgets ownership; the
ongoing demographic bonus of young
population. These trends are likely to
contribute towards the growth of extremism
in Indonesia and beyond.

Given the latest developments and existing
legal responsibilities, it should be presumed
that supporting the Government’s policy in
Prevention and Countering Violent
Extremism/P-CVE would become a
necessary aspect of Indonesian missions.
The legal responsibility consists of, among
others: (1) The equality of every Indonesian
citizen before the la w and duty to uphold it
(1945 Constitution); (2) Duties of a Mission
to protect State interests and assist
nationals (1961 & 1963 Vienna
Conventions); (3) Fostering unity and
harmony, while providing protection and

Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
27

legal assistance (1999 Law on Foreign
Relations); (4) Representing and advancing
national interest in accredited countries
(2004 Foreign Minister’s Decree No. 06); (5)
Duty to report criminal conspiracy (1981
Law on Criminal Procedure).

The purpose of this policy paper is to
investigate the means for detecting
indications of extremism in an Indonesian
overseas community, in the context of
Indonesian missions’ duties and
Government’s policies. To analyze the
problem of extremism in an overseas
community, a case study on the growth of
FTFs in Istanbul, Turkey (2016-2018) will be
used. The outcomes of this paper should
provide pioneering and valuable
contribution, providing policymakers with a
strategic body of knowledge, a working tool
to address the problem, thus helping to
enhance coordination  and inform decision -
making on the matter.

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
On violent extremism
Radicalism, derived from the Latin word
radix or root, can be defined as a trend to
drastic reform (Bealey & Johnson, 1999:
278). Radicalism and extremism are linked
but distinguishable from one another, as a
democratic system may accommodate the
political expressions of the former but not
the latter, since extremism’s dogmatic
demands and actions often do not
correspond with the existing social reality
(Botticher, 2017: 76). The links between
them could be simply understood as follows:
Radicalization becomes a process for
spreading the ideology of violent extremism,
which enables the acts of terrorism
(Striegher, 2015: 82).

While there is no dearth in definitions on
terrorism, a working definition that aptly
underscores its violence, psychological
effects beyond victims, and the extreme
need to gain leverage in a target population
would be, “The deliberate creation and
exploitation of fear through violence or
threat o f violence in the pursuit of political
change” (Hoffman, 2017 : 41 ). Meanwhile,
one definition of violent extremism that
demonstrates its linkage to terrorism is,
"Encouraging, condoning, justifying, or
supporting the commission of a violent act
to achieve political, ideological, religious,
social, or economic goals" ( UNODC). In
other words, violent extremism incites and
provides support base for terrorist
organizations and their attacks.

Motivations
Most terrorist groups would not attribute
their criminal  and violent acts on terrorism
per se , but often defend it on a basis of
certain rationales and urgency. As
Robespierre, the “father of terrorism”, once

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
28

put it, “Terror is nothing other than justice,
prompt, severe, inflexible; it is therefore an
emanation of virtue...” (Bienvenu, 1970 : 32-
49). Almost all terrorist groups would
identify themselves as fighters or defenders,
not criminals, and indeed many of them
originate from politically marginalized
protest communities (Sageman, 2017 : 23 -
25, 383).

At a mo re personal level, one’s willingness
to engage in violent extremism can be
explained by the need to restore certain
significance that is perceived to be lost, due
to trauma, frustration, stigmatization and
humiliation that one may experience
(Kruglanski et  al., 201 5: 20 -21). This
“significance quest theory” underscores
three important pillars of radicalization,
namely needs, narratives, and networks -
the “3Ns” -, that may be facilitated by
extremist groups. Naturally, reasons to
engage in violent extremism  would vary
from one person to another, but they can be
categorized into at least four general causes
(Bjorgø, 2005: 3-4):
1) Structural, trends such as
demographic imbalances,
globalization, modernization;
2) Facilitator (or accelerator), that make
it easy to employ terrorist methods,
such as technological advances in
media, transportation, computing,
and arms;
3) Motivational, through rhetoric of
ideologues and leaders that translate
structural causes into grievances
that people experience, persuading
them to take action;
4) Triggering causes, including acts or
events that provoke and become
direct precipitators of terrorist acts.
Even peace talks may trigger terror
attacks, as perpetrators seek to
undermine negotiations and discredit
moderates.

Detection, GCTS, and Indonesia’s Action
Plan
There have been no universally accepted
definitions on extremism and terrorism.
Nevertheless, that fact does not seem to
hinder Indonesia’s efforts at countering
these threats to national security and
promoting international coo peration on the
matter. Indonesia supports the formulation
and implementation of the Global Counter
Terrorism Strategy (GCTS), which
represents a common strategic and
operational approach to fighting terrorism
that relies not only on coercive measures,
but also on sustained efforts in addressing
conditions that are conducive to the spread
of terrorism (UNOCT, 2021). Among others,
the GCTS emphasizes on states’
engagements with religious authorities and
community leaders, especially in crafting
and deliverin g counter -narratives to

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
29

distorted terrorist narratives, while
amplifying positive narratives that cater to
vulnerable audiences (UNOCT, 2021).

Detection is decidedly the next step in
countering violent terrorism (CVE), following
prevention efforts that target considerably
broader audiences. Detection can be
directed towards assessing those
considered to be showing signs of exposure
to, and involvement in, violent extremism
(CREST, 2017). In GCTS’ context, detection
of violent extremism has a broader scope,
ranging from anticipating lone terrorists,
terrorist financing, to flow of travel of
international recruits to terrorist
organizations (UNOCT, 2021).

In line with the GCTS, the President of the
Republic of Indonesia has issued the
National Action Plan for Prevention and
Countering Violent Extremism Conducive to
Terrorism for 2020 -2024 ( BNPT, 2021:
Decree No. 7 , named “Perpres RAN PE ” in
Indonesian jargon). The Plan promotes soft
approach to complement the
implementation of existing national laws on
terrorism, involving government and civil
society stakeholders. Early detection falls
under the Plan’s first pillar of programmes,
which consists of prevention (alertness,
counter-radicalization, deradicalization),
prior to law enforcement  and protection of
witnesses and victims. It calls for the
development of a "community -based early
detection system" at national and local level
- particularly in priority or vulnerable areas –
in the forms of telephone hotline and
advocacy services, imple mented by
domestic agencies (BNPT, 2021).

ANALYSIS: CASE STUDY OF FTFS
TRAVELLING THROUGH ISTANBUL
Glocalism effect
For Indonesia, the threats of violent
extremism, terrorism, and foreign terrorist
fighters (FTFs) are not a novelty, as they
have taken roots ever since the nation’s
struggle for independence and continues to
exist until the present day. The so -called
“Islamic State of Indonesia” originated from
the Cisayong Declaration (1948 -1962)
evolved into urban terrorism in Java and
Sumatera (1977 -1981), and later the
clandestine “Jemaah Islamiyah”  (1985-
1998) (Solahudin, 2011 : 66 -73). JI
prospered in its base of operations in
Malaysia ( Tanjung & Chaidar, 2009)  and
managed to send up to 250 cadre members
to join military training in Afghanistan,
before waging terrorist bombing campaigns,
inflaming primordial conflicts in Indonesia
(2000-2010), and established paramilitary
camps in south Philippines (Solahudin,
2011: 157).

In the present day, clandestine terrorist
organizations persist in Indonesia and law

Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
30

enforcement authorities continue to thwart
their plots at building financial, arms,
recruitment, and tactical capabilities (Antara
News, 2021). With the recent wave of
Indonesian FTFs to Syria, there should be
little doubt that if left unchecked, the g rowth
of such groups would lead to future
instability in Indonesia’s social fabric.

The phenomenon of Indonesian foreign
terrorist fighters (FTFs) affiliated to the
“Islamic State” (IS) terrorist group in Syria
and Iraq could be understood as a
“glocalism effect”, in which social problems
at a locality find resonance and become
interdependent and interconnected with
other localities, thus requiring problem
solving at a global level.

The “calling” and its legal consequences
for Indonesian FTFs
In July 2014, the IS’ so -called “caliphate”
called for all Muslims, who are able, to
migrate to the territory under its control
(Bunzel, 2015: 32 ). The call attracted a lot
of Muslims from around the world - including
Indonesia - to move to IS-controlled territory
in Syria and Iraq, with little regard to the
area’s state of prolonged conflicts and
disorder. In short, they became the victim of
IS’ propaganda that promise d prosperity
and religious glory.
The Government of Indonesia was quick to
ban the IS in Indonesia in August 2014, with
Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa soon
called for Indonesians to not be swayed by
IS’ calling (Merdeka, 2014). However,
detection, prevention, deradicalization, and
law enforcement efforts against violent
extremism at the time have l ed to several
issues, such as: The ban on IS was not
followed up with firm travel bans and
inspections at airports; Backlogs in the
processing of deportees led to the
accumulation of up to 350 detainees in
Kelapa Dua police detention centre,
resulting in a  36-hour bloody standoff
(2018); The one -month shelter and
rehabilitation program for around 196 FTFs
deportees at social home facilities in East
Jakarta was decidedly ineffective, given that
some of its ‘alumni’ were later involved in
various terrorist at tacks and plots in
Indonesia and the Philippines.

Indonesia criminalizes terrorism through
several legal instruments, with offences that
include, among others : High treason ,
incitement and hate speech  (Criminal
Code); spread of distressing hoaxes  (1946
Criminal Law) ; distribution of offensive
information (2008 Law on Electronic
Information and Transactions); terrorist
crimes including creating atmosphere of
terror, involving children, joining, and
becoming terrorist corporations (2018 Law
on Crimes of Terr orism). Indeed, the
Government has prosecuted several cases

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
31

against FTF organizers affiliated to IS,
mainly using charges of criminal conspiracy,
attempted criminal acts of terrorism, and
creating an atmosphere of terror.

The land bridge
Turkey and es pecially its cosmopolitan
Istanbul have become an ideal transit point
for international FTFs’ migration to IS
territory, due to Istanbul’s international air
hub and the country’s “land bridge effect”
that connect the Middle East with at least
Europe, Centr al Asia, and Africa. By time
and distance, it would take roughly a day
trip to travel by road from Istanbul to the so -
called IS “capital” in Raqqa, northern Syria.
Indeed, travelling across border from Turkey
to Syria was relatively easier prior to the
2016 coup attempt in Turkey, which led to a
two-year state of emergency ( OHAL). In
2018, the 822 -kilometer separation wall at
the Turkish border was finalized, thus
helping to curb illegal cross -border trips to
war-torn Syria.
It should be noted that international FTFs
flowed to the ungoverned space in northern
Syria to join not only IS, but also to other
militant entities that included the Nusra
Front ( Jabhat Fatih al -Sham) and the
Kurdish Self-Defence Force (SDF/ PYD). It
was understood that from Indonesia, JI sent
fighters to train with JFS/ al -Nusra militants
based in Deyr az -Zowr, Syria, while pro -IS
groups travelled to IS -controlled territory in
Hasakeh and Raqqa.

For aspiring Indonesian FTFs, flights to
Istanbul became the main option to travel
closer to their destination . From spot
interviews conducted by Indonesian
missions’ staff based in Ankara and
Istanbul, many deportees booked tour
programs to Turkey - thus securing return
tickets to avoid scrutiny - before separating
themselves from tour groups and linking up
with pro-IS organizers that would help them
find temporary boarding and even odd jobs.
There are many routes travellers could use
to reach the border, either by road, rail, air,
and with ferry services available for trips
between provinces in the Marmara region.

Meanwhile, Turkey has not at all tightened
its visa regulations. Only by registering
online (evisa.gov.tr) and making payment by
credit card, one could secure a 30 -day visa
to Turkey without undergoing background
checks, demonstrating physical and mental
health, or even showing proof of economic
affordance. At the time, an Indonesian with
a Turkish e -visa printout could take
international flights and land at either
Ataturk (now closed, replaced by a new
airport on Black Sea sho res) or Sabiha
Gökçen airports, both located at greater
Istanbul. While there are international
airports in major tourist destinations such as

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
32

Izmir and Antalya, it was understood from
spot interviews that Istanbul remained a
main entry point for many Indonesian FTFs.
According to police briefs, foreigners’
movements in cities near the border such as
Gaziantep and Şanlıurfa, especially in
groups, would stand out and attract the
attention of either Turkish police,
paramilitary police ( jandarma), or military .
Some groups experienced turnback at
checkpoints (i.e., not allowed to proceed to
border areas), while some were detained for
deportation out of Turkey. Given the
tightening security, a cross -border trip to
northern Syria at the time would face
significant risk of discovery, taking more
time for laying low, with little chance of ever
making the crossing. Spot interviews held in
2017 pointed to some aspiring Indonesian
FTFs, exhausted of financial resources
(having brought little capital in the first
place), stayed in Istanbul and “continue the
jihad” by working at small stores and
workshops nearby, while awaiting further
news from colleagues.

Briefings from Istanbul Police gave
assurances to Consular Corps that the
immigration police at airports in Istanbu l
have become more proficient at detecting
travellers suspected as would -be FTFs.
Profiling, interviews, and physical searches
conducted at immigration checkpoints in
arrival terminals are said to have netted
thousands of suspicious individuals
between 201 6 and 2018, with acceptable
grounds for refusing their entry to Turkey.
For instance, the police showcased photos
of relevant evidence such as military garbs
and sharp weapons, IS materials, overly
light or overly heavy luggage, even contact
details of IS organizers hidden inside small
objects such as pens. Some of the
individuals could not explain their travel
plans, nor bringing reasonable amount of
money for the journey.

Consular assistance to Indonesian
detainees and deportees
The police crackdowns that followed the
2016 coup attempt and the 2017 New Year
mass shooting in Istanbul, revealed the
existence of IS safehouses in several
addresses, spread mostly in immigrant
communities along the western and
southwestern part of Istan bul. Police
information and spot interviews confirmed
that the safehouses , mostly flats , were
boarded by multiple nationals, not just
Indonesians, over the normal capacity. A
common flat would accommodate a nuclear
family of around four to six members . T he
ones used for safehouses would often hold
dozens of occupants.

Spot interviews to Indonesians netted in
such police operation were often met with
dishonest answers, made-up excuses, even

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
33

physical and verbal aggression to consular
staff. On one occasion,  a woman - already
overstayed her visa - claimed to come to
Istanbul for honeymoon with her newly -
wedded husband, although both were
arrested in an IS flat packed with at least 10
other multi -national strangers. Meanwhile,
on another occasion another staff  was
pushed and yelled at, accused of being “the
intelligence” who foiled their supposedly
holy journey.

 A typical response by an Indonesian
mission for its arrested nationals overseas
would be to offer consular assistance and
making efforts to facilitat e the legal problem
that the persons face. Such could be done,
for example, by providing interpreter and
advocacy services, thus speeding up their
release and departure back to Indonesia.
However, the non -cooperation and harsh
attitudes of alleged FTFs cre ated additional
challenge in fulfilling those tasks.

It should be noted at this point that the
hostile attitudes actually helped the
experienced consular staff to distinguish the
Indonesian FTF groups from genuine
travellers in distress, thus providing a n
important point for further reporting, should
there be questions from the Indonesian
authorities. It was also observed on some
occasions that the aggression showed by
such individuals while in police detention
was actually an effort to impress other
Indonesians sharing their cells, with some of
them only recently met over the journey.
 Another notable disposition of alleged
Indonesian FTFs found in Istanbul is their
delusions of existing reality. One spot
interview found a young Indonesian
detainee claimi ng not to know of a
protracted war taking place in Syria, despite
owning a smartphone – thus should be able
to follow news - and wishing to start a new
life in  “blessed land”. Yet another one
sought shelter in the Indonesian mission,
freshly clothed with l ocal brands and
claiming to be held against his will , but
curiously refused to make a report to local
police. He was later found trying to influence
others in the shelter to join him to “get work
in Mosul” (Iraq).

 It was a tragedy that consular staff oft en
found Indonesian children netted in police
operations, with their parents not being
found in  the same address or any other
address being raided by the police at the
time. The children were either abandoned
by their FTF parents or being put in an
illegal shelter run by FTFs organizers.
Furthermore, several children were found
on separate occasions being accompanied
by adults who are not their biological
parents. Following raids, the police often
handed over netted children in the care of
various state -run social homes all over

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
34

Istanbul. The social homes were in general
in good conditions, but with limited number
of counsellors and hundreds of foster
children in each home – many of which
were found to be non -Turkish nationals and
related to other FTFs cases  – made it not
an acceptable option to leave Indonesian
children in those homes. Meanwhile, the
police and social services would only allow
their release to an acceptable legal
guardian.

Thus, Indonesian missions in Turkey began
efforts to interview each abandoned
Indonesian child to find out about their next
of kin. Though almost all children naturally
could not recall their home address in
Indonesia, through weeks of chatting and
playing the consular staff were able to
“guesstimate” its general location based on
the child’s memory, usually by asking which
kindergarten and elementary school or
clinic, market and mall they usually went to.
With the assistance of counterparts in
Indonesia, t he minimum information was
developed and the missions were able to
locate the children’s address and next of
kin, secured verified copies of Family Cards
(Kartu Keluarga ) back home, thus
establishing acceptable legal guardianships
that swiftly facilitated the children’s
repatriation to Indonesia.

Distinguishing between denied
travellers, deportees, and repatriates
Based on descriptions above, there are at
least three categories of Indonesian FTFs:
(1) Denied travellers , those who were
prevented from leav ing by Indonesian
authorities or those refused entry by Turkish
immigration; (2) Deportees, who were able
to enter and stayed in Turkey, but were later
detained and deported by Turkish police,
mostly on the grounds of visa violations; (3 )
Repatriates, who lived in IS -controlled
territory and were sent home.

There were also Indonesian IS FTFs
detainees held mainly in camps such as Al -
Hol or Al-Roj (Hasakeh) or Ain-Issa (Raqqa)
following the fall of IS in Syria and Iraq. The
de facto authority who runs these camps is
the Kurdish Administrative Authority for
North East Syria (AANES/ Rojava). The
camps receive humanitarian assistance
(hygiene, medical aid ) from international
NGO Medecins Sans Frontieres , in
cooperation with the Kurdish Red Crescent
based in Qamishli, Syria (MSF, 2020).

DISCUSSIONS: DRIVERS AND
SCENARIOS
External and internal drivers
From the case study, there is a lesson
learned that the risks posed by FTFs abroad
to Indonesia's national security are very real
and could not be underestimated, as

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
35

becoming apparent from various terror plots
in Indonesia, such as: Central Jakarta terror
attacks (2016) that was funded by
Indonesian FTFs based in Raqqa; Surabaya
bombings (2018) that was allegedly directed
by a former dep ortee; Jolo Cathedral
bombing and subsequent terror plots on the
island (2019) perpetrated by a family of
former deportees. Indonesia’s diplomacy in
dealing with FTFs has thus “gone local”, in
the sense that missions abroad need to
support and correspond w ith the
Government’s efforts to address security
problems at home.

Early detection of extremism has become
necessary, since extremist cells can and
have grown in Indonesian overseas
communities, thus enabling crimes of
terrorism. Indeed, fundamental shif ts in the
society have reinforced the “glocalism
effect” of extremism in Indonesia and
beyond. Therefore, assessment of those
considered to be exposed to violent
extremism should be a useful capability for
an Indonesian mission, in that the former
will hel p the mission to make informed
decisions and strategize on the matter.

To investigate the means for detecting
extremism in Indonesian overseas
communities, the scenario planning
approach is used to help identify relevant
driving factors and consider alter native
strategies that Indonesian missions could
undertake. The driving factors for extremism
could be categorized into at least external
and internal ones, which can then be broken
down into four causal categories (see
Bjorgø, 2005: 3-4).

Following the previous discussions, external
drivers may consist of at least two factors:
(1) Patronage of international terrorist
organizations - substantial support that not
only calling for fighters’ allegiance but also
providing logistics to travel and launch
attacks elsewhere -, which serves as a
structural cause enabling cross -border
movements of foreign terrorist fighters, and;
(2) Online activism, as the growth of social
media has allowed terrorist groups to reach
wider, multi -national audience, in order to
spread their propaganda, recruit members,
and direct attacks. The two factors are
linked and mutually reinforcing, in that one
demonstrates the existence and credibility
of the other.

Meanwhile, internal drivers in Indonesia for
the spread of extremism may inc lude at
least two factors: (1) Domestic militancy ,
being motivated and nurtured by various
extremist groups in Indonesia, and; (2)
Public distrust to government, as evident in
widespread negative sentiments – e.g.,
anger, fear, discontent - that can be
triggered by current events, such as the

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
36

Government’s perceived mishandling of the
pandemic that led to public health and
economic woes. Similarly, the two factors
feed into each other . The militant groups
routinely manipulate information to
rationalize anti -government narratives, in
the process feeding public distrust towards
increasing its support base.


Possible future scenarios
A broad and simplistic planning would
envisage at least four likely scenarios for
the near future. Titles from motion pictures
are borrowed for ease of discussion, as
follows: (Graph 1)
1) Scenario 1: “The Perfect Storm” .
Imagine a repeat of what happened
between 2014 and 2016 in the future,
when international terrorism called for
loyalty from their followers and
enabled flow of resources (i.e.,
funding, personnel, travel) to increase
terrorist activities worldwide, while
leveraging social media that reinforces
violent extremism in communities. At
home, militant groups stepped up
activities to exploit grievances and
intolerance, framing hate narratives
that feeds into public anger and
distrust.
2) Scenario 2: “Never Say Never
Again”. International patronage for
terrorism revives, with calling to
relocate and join the movement
overseas. Networked computing helps
with storage, repackaging, and
distribution of propaganda materials to
extremist social media channels and
groups. In Indones ia, tensions over
political polarization subside, due to
government crackdowns and bans on
extremist organizations. Public
sentiment is in an upswing,
encouraged by the improving
economy. This is similar to
Indonesia’s situation pre -pandemic in
2019, when terrorist groups at home
received funding to move to IS -
“Khorasan” and attack police
headquarters (BBC News, 2019),
while economic growth and
infrastructure development inspired
public confidence.
3) Scenario 3: “ The Quiet Place” . A
somewhat ideal yet unlike ly scenario,
in which there seems to be minimum
drivers for extremism across the board.
However, appearance of calm could
be deceiving, hindsight is always
20/20, and tensions might be
simmering just under the surface. For
instance, one can wax nostalgic a bout

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
37

Indonesia’s relative peace and
prosperity in the 1980s and 1990s, but
it was also the times when various
terrorist and separatist groups – even
the Japanese Red Army ( Sekigun) on
one occasion – established presence
in Indonesia and set up clandestine
networks overseas. The government’s
repression against public criticisms at
the time helped to conceal public
grievances, as well as the growth of
terrorist groups in Indonesia.
4) Scenario 4: “The Raid”. International
terrorism declines, with relative loss of
control over flow of resources.
Activism through social media
continues, but access to international
audience was disrupted by countries’
prevention policies that include
censorships, counter -narratives, and
deradicalization programs. In
Indonesia, domestic militancy remains
high due to persisting political issues
that extremist groups can exploit to
gain leverage, while public distrust is
worsening due to spread of hoaxes.
This is similar to Indonesia’s 2018, a
“political year” that saw the
Government finally took a firm stance
against terrorism, while the public was
bombarded by misinformation
campaigns that ran rampant over
social media. Even the popular
platform Whatsapp soon took action to
limit message forwarding, in a bid to
curb virality (January 2019).

On nearly all of the four broad scenarios
described above, there is a need to develop
working capability for detection of
extremism in Indonesian overseas
communities:
 In The Perfect Storm  scenario, the
problem becomes complicated since
intense patronage abroad found
resonance at home, with promises of
certain rewards, coupled with
heightening distrust over the
government’s good will. However, it
is indeed a rare occasion for a
terrorist gr oup to demonstrate such
global influence.
 The Never Say Never Again
scenario would likely see less violent
extremist actions in public, though
forceful political protests may occur
and the government should probably
be vigilant on extremist groups’
efforts at organizational building (i.e.,
recruiting, financing, arming, training,
alliances) at this point.
 The Quiet Place  scenario seems
unlikely, and actually may point
towards a distorted picture that does
not represent the existing socio -
economic and political conditions.
 The Raid scenario is more likely and
commonplace, as international

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
38

terrorism persists, with Indonesia
having a history of chronic domestic
militancy and its government
maintains a rather relaxed control
over online information. Low media
literacy among the population also
makes it susceptible to extremist
influences.

A tool for assessing violent extremism
risks
In any case, in an open and multicultural
society like Indonesia, there will always be
certain political aspirations that could lead to
acts of violent extremism. The important
thing for Indonesian missions – through
monitoring and detection - is to keep the
proverbial fingers on the pulse of
Indonesian overseas communities in their
accredited areas.

A fresh search for a homegrown  (i.e.,
developed by Indonesian e xperts) working
instrument for detection of extremism could
begin from the Motivation -Ideology-
Capability Risk Assessment, or MIKRA for
short ( Sukabdi, 2021b: 1 -12). MIKRA is a
tool for assessing FTFs, terrorist offenders
at prisons/ rehabilitation facilities , women
within terrorist organizations, and children in
areas of conflict (i.e., Poso) , thus
recognizing prior identification of risks and
needs of subjects before applying the
necessary intervention  (Amelia, Widodo, &
Budiarto, 2020; APSIFOR, 2020; APSIFOR,
2021; Slamet, 2020; Sukabdi, 2020;
Sukabdi, 2021c; Sukabdi, forthcoming).
 Although used in intervention settings, the
MIKRA tool offers useful concepts for
detection of extremism in a community, and
should help bridg e communication between
Indonesian mission with justice
professionals. The key concepts include
(Sukabdi, 2018; 2020; 2021b: 1-12):
1) Three domains of needs: (a)
Motivations that drive actions
(including interests, will, drives,
feelings, emotions); (b) Ide ology that
provides justifications, knowledge,
rationalisations, values (incl. belief
systems, thought process, ideas,
mindsets, commitment); (c) Capability
that covers physical performance of
skills.
2) 18 risk factors, grouped into
motivation, ideology, and  capability
domains:
a) Motivations (6): Economic,
justice, situational, social,
superiority, actualization;
b) Ideology (6): Values, violent
ideology-driven attitudes, beliefs
about objectives, layers in
ideological groups, militancy,
understandings on philosophy;
c) Capability (6): Skills that include
intelligence, language, ICT,

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
39

military, social domination,
mechanical and electrical.
3) Five-type band corresponding to risk
factors - ‘very-high’, ‘high’, ‘medium’,
‘low’, and ‘no risk’ (in need of
protection). The ban d is formulated
based on the author’s consultations
with academic, security, social, and
religious establishments.


POLICY OPTIONS
With extremist groups being facilitated by
technology to connect and find resonance
with their sympathizers beyond national
borders, Indonesian missions could find
themselves with a new mission to detect
extremism amid Indonesian communities in
their areas.

Based on discussions about the Istanbul
case study and broad scenarios above, it
could be surmised that securing cooperation
with receiving State authorities is important
in handling the increase of Indonesian FTFs
cases. The FTFs are likely to violate the
terms of their visas or resident permits, and
not likely to report their residence in -country
to Indonesian missions. Meanwhile, there
can be support from local residents, who
are sympathetic to their cause.

In the likelihood of The Raid  scenario, it
should become a  priority for the Indonesian
mission concerned to assess the existence,
motivation, ideology, and skills of extremist
group/s in its community. Their presence
carries significant risk to Indonesia’s
security and also to receiving country, an d
may cause significant surge in cases that
require attention.

Following the detection and monitoring of
extremism in an Indonesian overseas
community, the Indonesian mission may
have to weigh up several policy choices,
that could complement each other an d
include the following: (1) Do nothing; (2)
Making inquiries; (3) Coordinate with law
enforcement; (4) Provide shelter (or not); (5)
Assist with repatriation.

Doing nothing. A mission can decide not to
take action to a problem, including with
regard to the existence of skilled, committed
extremists, or women and children being
held in police custody. After all, there are
local authorities sanctioned to handle the
problem, including by detaining,
prosecuting, or deporting them. While doing
nothing may allo w more time for further
observations, it will not yield important
information that stakeholders need in such
cases, such as who are being deported and
when, in what condition, or whether their
next of kin as well as relevant agencies in
Indonesia have been notified.

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
40

Making inquiries.  By contacting local
authorities and asking for consular access,
an Indonesian mission could help facilitate
the processing of suspected FTFs (e.g.,
offer translator services), while conducting
spot interviews to learn how they  get into
the problem in the first place and who else
may be affected by the same problem, thus
allowing the mission to estimate the scale of
the problem and prepare for anticipative
measures. There are typically time and
place constraints in these spot in terviews,
especially if they occur in detention facilities,
therefore requiring competent staff who has
the ability to seamlessly combine eliciting
information with building empathic rapport
with the subjects.

Making reports.  For an Indonesian
mission, making reports to law enforcement
authorities requires several considerations.
Firstly, reporting to local authorities is not
within the duty of an Indonesian mission,
and should only be done when there is a
crucial interest, such as to provide extra
layer of protection to Indonesian diplomatic
and consular staff and premises.
Meanwhile, access and cooperation from
local authorities are not always guaranteed
in the first place. Secondly, reporting to
Indonesian authorities should be part of a
coordinated effo rt to solve FTFs problems
and other related issues, such as missing
persons reports, unaccompanied children,
as well as in securing cooperation with local
authorities.

Shelter (or not).  Providing shelter is a
typical assistance provided by a mission for
Indonesian nationals in vulnerable
condition. However, its allowance should be
considered on a case -by-case basis. As
shelter spaces within embassies and
consulates are not secure facilities, FTFs
and criminals might see it as an opportun ity
to be exploited. Among others, a shelter
commonly has unhindered access to
otherwise dangerous equipment in the
kitchen, while close proximity with other
occupants allows for unhealthy interactions
to take place in the premises, including
influencing o thers to join their journey to
conflict zone.

Repatriation. The decision to repatriate
Indonesian nationals should also be done
on a case -by-case basis and with due
diligence, by considering all the
circumstances and the case’s genuine
exigency. That inc ludes the sincerity,
vulnerability, and infirmity of the person in
question. Statements need to be confirmed
with evidence, to understand the scale of
the problem and to learn if there are other
victims involved. Furthermore, arrivals in
Indonesia need to be coordinated with
relevant authorities, to ensure the presence
of receiving next of kin and reassessment

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
41

as well as facilitation by relevant social,
medical, and security services.

CONCLUSION AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
Conclusion
This paper has explored the context, the
framework, the likely scenarios, as well as a
working instrument that can help Indonesian
missions with the task of detecting
extremism in Indonesian overseas
communities. Certain resourcefulness is
needed for the m issions to monitor and
assess violent risks in those communities,
whether through interviews, in -person
encounters, or observations on social media
scene. The lessons learned within the
scope of this paper should inform
policymakers in their decision makin g and
coordination on the matter.

As the implementing agency for foreign
policy and diplomacy, the Ministry for
Foreign Affairs needs to develop the
capability and preparedness of its
diplomats, in order to anticipate the problem
of extremism in Indonesia n overseas
communities. The trend of extremism in
Indonesian overseas communities is not
exactly new, having spread over places like
Malaysia, Pakistan -Afghanistan border,
south Philippines, Hong Kong, and Istanbul.
Given the support networks and
unsuspecting missions, the problem could
extend to other areas of the world.

The international ideological pull to relocate
overseas would not appeal to Indonesian
audience when there is no critical mass of
sympathizers built up by militant groups.
Therefore, the  Ministry needs to build
synergy and commitment between
government agencies, while employing a
whole-of-society approach in contributing to
mitigate the gravity of the problem.

Situated at the frontline of diplomacy,
Indonesian missions deals directly with
Indonesian overseas communities on a
daily basis. In order to protect these
“neighborhoods”, mission staff has to
demonstrate its role as a sincere actor and
honest broker, in order to win the trust of
community members. For that reason,
detection of extremism needs to be
conducted in the most credible way that it
does not lead to waves of anxiety, fear, nor
polarizing among the population concerned.
To emphasize, special consideration and
tact are of the essence.

Recommendations for Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and Indonesian Missions
1. For internal capacity building :
Establish guidelines for detection in an
Indonesian overseas community;
encourage storage and sharing

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
42

database of consular cases, under
strict privacy guidelines; conduct
periodic refresher  courses on violent
risk assessment for staff; establish
consular services laboratory for
training, simulation, and studies.
2. For community outreach in overseas
missions: Improve consular services,
meeting and shelter facilities at
missions; develop attract ive cultural
and sports programs; promote
counter-narrative and positive
messages about Indonesia; engage
with credible social media actors in
Indonesian overseas communities;
where possible, involve credible
voices from non-government, authority
figures.
3. For strengthening interagency
cooperation: Promote synergy with
competent government agencies in
Indonesia; engage with receiving
country’s agencies and authorities, in
order to build rapport and lobby for
assistance; foster technical
cooperation with rece iving country’s
agencies and authorities.
4. In regional and multilateral fora :
Encourage cooperation in detecting
terrorist financing, recruitment, and
flow of FTF travels; voice concerns
over the borderless nature of terrorism
and promote capacity building along
GCTS/ P-CVE themes.

Abstract
The current political and security developments in Afghanistan are still challenging and even uncertain.
After the withdrawal of US troops and the NATO coalition, the Taliban seized power from the previous
government. This takeover was swift and shocked the international community. The international media
outlets took this poli tical development in Afghanistan as headlines, while scholars, policy makers and
diplomats trying to analyze the future of Afghanistan under the Taliban. The general picture shown is
unrest, security crisis, chaos, uncertainty and fear. This study aims to analyze how the Taliban came to
power and how the countries in the region address this change. This study is also intended to look at the
challenges faced by the Taliban as the new ruler, as well as the role the international community can
play. In addition, this study also offers recommendations for Indonesia's foreign policy and what role it can
play in relation to political developments in this country.

PENDAHULUAN
Perkembangan politik dan keamanan di
Afghanistan hingga saat ini menjadi
perhatian dunia internasional. Pasca
Amerika Serikat menarik pasukannya dari
Afghanistan, kelompok Taliban berhasil
menguasai negeri ini. Dalam waktu kurang
dari sepekan, sembilan ibu kota provins i
berhasil dikuasai tanpa perlawanan berarti. 1
Puncaknya, pasukan Taliban menduduki
Kota Kabul secara penuh pada tanggal 15
Agustus 2021. Pemerintah status quo
pimpinan Presiden Asraf Ghani akhirnya
lumpuh. Asraf Ghani beserta pejabat
penting lainnya melar ikan diri dan pasukan
keamanan Afghanistan memilih meletakkan
senjata saat menyaksikan pasukan Taliban
memasuki jantung ibu kota Kabul.

Kembali tampilnya Taliban sebagai
penguasa menimbulkan goncangan politik
di Afghanistan dan kawasan sekitar.
Puluhan r ibu warga sipil berusaha
melarikan diri mencoba mencari suaka di
negara lain untuk mencari kehidupan yang
lebih aman. Mereka khawatir Taliban akan
melakukan tindakan represif setelah
berkuasa kembali. Memori lama tentang

kebijakan konservatif Taliban, sema cam
pembatasan kebebasan perempuan dan
pemberlakuan hukum syariah yang ketat
dalam hal ini menghantui rakyat
Afghanistan. Negara -negara di kawasan,
seperti India, Iran, Pakistan, dan Rusia juga
langsung mengambil tindakan dengan
meningkatkan status “waspad a” terkait
kemungkinan terjadinya ancaman nasional
yang bakal mereka dihadapi.

Tampilnya Taliban sebagai penguasa
tunggal di Afghanistan memunculkan babak
sejarah baru, sekaligus tantangan yang
makin kompleks. Untuk kedua kalinya
Taliban kembali berkuasa setelah sekitar 20
tahun berperang menghadapi AS. Pasukan
AS dan koalisi NATO hengkang pada
tanggal 31 Agustus 2021, persis seperti
halnya nasib para imperium -imperium
sebelumnya yang pernah menginvasi
Afghanistan. Penarikan pasukan AS ini
memperkuat pandangan bahwa Afghanistan
memang menjadi kuburan para imperium -
imperium dunia (graveyard of impires).

Gonjang-ganjing politik di Afghanistan ini
juga memunculkan berbagai pertanyaan
besar. Bagaimana masa depan Afghanistan
di bawah kekuasaan Taliban? Apakah
berkuasanya kembali Taliban dapat
memberi angin perubahan menuju negara
yang lebih aman, stabil dan makmur? Apa
tantangan-tantangan yang dihadapi

Taliban? Bagaimana sikap dan kebijakan
negara-negara di kawasan terkait dinamika
di Afghanistan? Dan, bagaima na peran
dunia internasional, termasuk pemerintah
Indonesia dalam menyikapi perkembangan
tersebut?

DISKUSI & ANALISA
Akar Kompleksitas
Sangat penting untuk memahami sejarah
Afghanistan untuk dapat menganalisa akar
permasalahan yang saat ini terjadi di negeri
ini. Perspektif historis penting untuk
digunakan dalam melihat akar
permasalahan di Afghanistan. Mohsen
Makhmalbaf dan Asne Sejesrtad menyebut
budaya dan masyarakat Afghanistan sangat
kompleks. 2  Keduanya juga menyimpulkan

Iran dan sutradara film “Kandahar.” Asne Sejesrtad
adalah seorang penulis dari Norwegia, salah satu
karyanya adalah “The Bookseller of Kabul.”
sangat sulit mengenal masyarakatnya tanpa
memahami karakterisik kehidupan sosio -
budaya nya.

Kompleksitas Afghanistan salah satunya
terkait dengan keberagaman suku yang
mempengaruhi dinamika politik di negeri ini.
Berdasarkan demografinya, masyarakat
Afghanistan terbagi dalam beragam etnis.
Etnis mayoritas adalah Pashtun, jumlahnya
mencapai 42% dari keseluruhan populasi.
Beberapa etnis lainnya yaitu Tajik (27%),
Uzbek (9%), Hazara (9%), Aimaq (4%),
Turkmen (3%), dan Baluch (2%). Masing -
masing suku tersebut memiliki
keberagaman budaya, bahasa, dan adat
istiadat yang kokoh.

Keberagaman etnis di Afghanistan menjadi
salah satu sumber konflik politik. 3 Terdapat
beberapa faktor yang memicu konflik
antaretnis, antara lain: (1) adanya
pembentukan hierarki etnis untuk
menegaskan dominasi etnis Pashtun pada
masa kepemimpinan Adur Rahman Khan;
(2) batas -batas wilayah etnis seringk ali
berubah-ubah; dan (3) belum adanya
kebijakan yang memadai untuk menjawab
kebutuhan setiap kelompok. 4  Ketegangan
antar etnis inilah yang kemudian seringkali
membuat konflik terjadi sampai beberapa
dekade terakhir, baik di tingkat akar rumput
maupun elite politiknya.

Etnisitas menyebabkan pengkotak -
kotakan di Afghanistan. Loyalitas kepada
etnis tertentu lebih bersifat dominan.
Bahkan, semangat loyalitas kepada etnis
tertentu lebih kuat dari ikatan lainnya,
termasuk rasa nasionalitas kebangsaan.
Hal ini m enjadi lebih parah setelah isu
etnisitas dimanfaatkan oleh kalangan elit
politik dalam kontestasi perebutan
kekuasaan. Etnisitas yang teramat kuat ini
kerap disimpulkan bahwa bangsa

Afghanistan akan gagal mencapai
terbentuknya sebuah “national building.”

Ketegangan etnis di Afghanistan kerap
terjadi antara etnis Pashtun selaku
mayoritas dengan tiga etnis lainnya, yakni:
Uzbek, Tajik, dan Hazara. Etnis Pashtun
terkonsentrasi di bagian Selatan dan
Tenggara Afghanistan (berbatasan
langsung dengan Pakistan). Kelompok ini
menganggap diri mereka sebagai etnis
dominan dan menginginkan preferensi
khusus, meskipun jumlahnya kurang dari
setengah populasi.

Taliban berharap dapat menyelesaikan
masalah etnisitas dalam bingkai negara
Islam Emirate. Namun, semangat Tal iban
ini juga tidak mudah diwujudkan. Taliban
yang dibentuk Mullah Omar ini cenderung
eksklusif dan ketat dalam menjalankan
hukum syariah Islam. Perempuan -
perempuan di Afghanistan juga diharuskan
untuk mengikuti syariat -syariat Islam
sesuai versi mereka. D iskriminasi
terhadap perempuan memang menjadi isu
ketika Taliban berkuasa. Taliban bahkan
tidak segan -segan merusak gambar -
gambar wanita di berbagai salon
kecantikan di kota -kota besar termasuk
Kabul. Gambar -gambar wanita dianggap
bertentangan dengan syari at karena
dianggap mengumbar aurat. Selain itu,
perempuan di Afghanistan juga dilarang

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
49

untuk mengikuti kuliah atau bekerja di
universitas. Mereka baru diizinkan apabila
‘lingkungan Islam’ telah diciptakan. Aturan
itu menjadi salah satu langkah dari Taliban
untuk menciptakan pengecualian bagi
perempuan dari kehidupan publik.5
Akar kompleksitas masalah di Afghanistan
juga dipengaruhi oleh kuatnya peran
kekuatan eksternal. Negeri ini telah sekian
lama menjadi arena persaingan dan
pertempuran kekuatan -kekuatan dunia.
Misalnya pertarungan “ the Great Game ”
antara Inggris dan Rusia pada abad 19.
Pertarungan besar semacam ini sejatinya
juga masih berlangsung dengan
melibatkan negara -negara di kawasan,
seperti konflik India -Pakistan, Rusia -AS,
Iran-AS, Iran -Saudi dan  masih banyak
lagi. Hal tersebut menunjukkan bahwa
Afghanistan secara berkelanjutan telah
menjadi ajang proxy-war yang melibatkan
berbagai pemain sesuai kepentingan nya
masing-masing.

Pergantian kekuasaan di Afghanistan
seringkali diiringi dengan kekeras an.
Transisi kekuasaan muncul sebagai hasil
dari sebuah perang dan pertumpahan
darah. Selama tahun 1960 -1990-an,

banyak pemimpin dan elit politik
Afghanistan yang tewas dalam proses
transisi kekuasaan. Fraksionasi etnis turut
memberi pengaruh terhadap munc ulnya
fenomena transisi yang sarat dengan
kekerasan tersebut. Masyarakat
Afghanistan terutama para elite politik
mereka dengan demikan dapat dikatakan
belum mampu menciptakan proses transisi
kekuasaan yang damai.

Taliban Versi lama atau Baru?
Dunia intern asional telah mengamati
peristiwa perebutan kekuasaan oleh
Taliban pada bulan Agustus 2021. Transisi
kekuasaan ini dianggap dunia
internasional tidak sah (inkonstituen)
karena tidak melalui cara -cara damai,
demokratis atau pemilihan umum.
Masyarakat intern asional lalu turut
merasakan kekhawatiran bakal timbulnya
perang saudara dan konflik berkelanjutan
yang mengancam stabilitas Afghanistan
maupun kawasan.

Psikologi dunia internasional memang
masih trauma dengan kebrutalan dari
Taliban saat berkuasa pada tahun 1990an.
Para pemimpin dunia, khususnya negara -
negara Barat pesimis, apriori, dan khawatir
terkait ideologi radikal yang diusung
Taliban. Kelompok ini terlanjur dicap
sebagai kelompok teroris. Kemunculan
Taliban dikhawatirkan dapat mendorong

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
50

gelombang radikalisme dan terorisme
global. Kekhawatiran ini mendorong dunia
internasional untuk mendesak Taliban
agar membentuk pemerintahan yang
inklusif, menghormati HAM, dan tidak
diskriminatif terhadap kaum minoritas
serta perempuan.
Pada tanggal 6 September 20 21,
pemerintahan Taliban mengumumkan
struktur pemerintahan barunya setelah
kurang lebih satu bulan menguasai Kabul.
Beberapa tokoh senior Taliban tampil
menjabat posisi strategis. Mullah
Muhammad Akhund ditunjuk sebagai
Perdana Menteri. Ia sebelumnya menja di
penasehat politik Mullah Omar, pendiri
Taliban, dan pernah menduduki jabatan
Menlu serta Wakil PM di tahun 1990an. Ia
dianggap tokoh garis keras dan pernah
masuk dalam daftar sanksi PBB.
Sederetan tokoh seperti Molvi Muhammad
Yaqoob (Menteri Pertahanan) , Alhaj
Mullah Sirajuddin Haqqani (Menteri Dalam
Negeri), Mullah Hedayatullah Badri
(Menteri Keuangan) dipandang sebagai
sosok garis keras yang dapat mewarnai
kebijakan pemerintah Taliban.6

Mayoritas sosok yang masuk di kabinet
pemerintahan Taliban sebenarnya adalah

wajah-wajah lama. Mereka umumnya
adalah tokoh -tokoh senior yang memiliki
hubungan dekat dengan pendiri Taliban.
Yang menarik, semuanya adalah laki -laki
dan tidak satupun pos strategis yang
diduduki perempuan. Kementerian
Pemberdayaan Wani ta ( Ministry of
Women’s Affairs Restructuring and
Empowerment) yang sebelumnya dibentuk
di masa pemerintahan Asraf Ghani juga
ditiadakan.

Pemerintah baru Taliban tetap identik
dengan suku Pasthun, meski tidak
semuanya mendukung kelompok ini. Hal
ini juga  terlihat dalam komposisi anggota
kabinet yang sebagian besar berasal dari
suku Pasthun. Hanya kurang lebih tiga
tokoh dari suku Tajik dan Uzbek yang
ditunjuk sebagai pejabat menteri.
Komposisi ini makin menguatkan persepsi
kalau pemerintah Taliban kurang inklusif
dengan tidak melibatkan suku -suku
minoritas dalam struktur pemerintahannya.

Reaksi Dunia Internasional
Dunia internasional cenderung skeptis,
curiga dan bahkan berhati -hati untuk
hanya membuka komunikasi dengan
Taliban. Pendekatan “wait and see”  yang
bersifat pasif lebih dipilih sejumlah negara,
seperti AS, Uni Eropa dan negara lainnya.
Terdapat beberapa alasan dunia

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
51

internasional bersikap hati -hati, bahkan
“anxious” dengan Taliban.

Pertama, banyak negara masih
memandang Taliban sebagai kelompo k
teroris karena memiliki hubungan dengan
Al-Qaeda dan Osama bin Laden. Salah
satu faksi di Taliban, yakni Haqqani
Network bahkan masuk ke daftar
kelompok teroris oleh AS dan PBB. 7
Haqqani Network dianggap radikal karena
berafiliasi tidak hanya dengan Al -Qaeda,
melainkan juga dengan Intelejen Pakistan
(ISI). Sarajuddin Haqqani yang ditunjuk
sebagai Menteri Dalam Negeri
diindikasikan memiliki hubungan erat
dengan Haqqani Network. Ole h sebab itu
menjadi wajar jika pandangan dunia
internasional tentang Taliban sebagai
kelompok teroris masih belum berubah.

Kedua, pemerintahan Taliban dianggap
tidak sah karena berkuasa tanpa melalui
mekanisme yang legal (pemilu). Ketiga,
Taliban yang be rkuasa saat ini dianggap
sebagai kelanjutan dari bentuk Taliban
lama (1990an). Masyarakat internasional
masih menganggap Taliban belum
berubah, di mana mereka dinilai masih
belum moderat, inklusif, menghormati

HAM, dan melindungi kaum minoritas dan
perempuan.

Engagement vs disengagement
Meski belum ada yang memberikan
pengakuan, beberapa negara mulai
membangun komunikasi dengan
pemerintah Taliban atau melalui
perwakilannya di Doha, Qatar.
Pemerintahan China adalah salah satu
negara yang cukup aktif membangun
komunikasi dengan Taliban. Menlu Wang
Yi melakukan pertemuan dengan Mullah
Abdul Ghani Baradar di Doha tanggal 26
Oktober 2021. Sebelumnya, Menlu Wang
Yi juga telah bertemu dengan Mullah
Abdul Ghani Baradar di Tianjin pada
tanggal 28 Juli 2018. S ecara umum,
pemerintah China bersedia untuk
membantu proses pembangunan yang
dilakukan oleh pemerintah Afghanistan.
Namun sebagai timbal baliknya, Taliban
diharapkan tidak mendukung gerakan
kelompok radikal Gerakan Islam Turkestan
Timur (East Turkestan Isl amic
Movement/ETIM) yang dianggap sebagai
kelompok teroris oleh Beijing. Beberapa
alasan China merangkul Taliban dikaitkan
dengan alasan keamanan dan ekonomi,
termasuk Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
dan keberlanjutan China -Pakistan

Economic Corridor (CPEC)  di

Setelah itu ada India yang membangun
komunikasi politik dengan Taliban. India
menilai Taliban sebagai kepanjangan
tangan Pakistan selaku musuh
bebuyutannya, sehingga mereka akan
senantiasa bersedia membangun
komunikasi yang baik. Diwakili Dubes nya
di Qata r, Deepak Mittal telah menemui
Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai selaku
kepala Kantor Politik Taliban di Doha.
Pertemuan ini diinisiasi Taliban dan
berlangsung di Kedutaan Besar India pada
31 Agustus 2021. Dalam pertemuannya,
Stanikzai meminta agar hubungan
ekonomi, politik, dan budaya antara kedua
negara tetap terjalin bahkan dapat
ditingkatkan.

Rusia sebagai pemain penting di kawasan
Asia Tengah juga telah menjalin
komunikasi dengan Taliban. Melalui
penyelenggaraan Konferensi Moskow
pada tanggal 20 Oktober 2021,  Rusia
mengundang delegasi Taliban untuk
membahas berbagai isu perkembangan di
Afghanistan. Beberapa negara lain turut

hadir dalam pertemuan tersebut, seperti:
China, India, Pakistan, Iran, dan lima
negara bekas Uni Soviet. Rusia dalam
pertemuan ini mencob a menyerukan
bantuan PBB untuk Afghanistan.

Pada tanggal 12 September 2021, Menlu
Qatar, Syekh Muhammad juga bertemu
dengan Mullah Muhammad Hasan
Akhund. Syekh Muhammad. Dalam
pertemuan yang berlangsung di Kabul ini,
Syekh Muhammad mendorong pemerintah
Taliban bersifat inklusif dalam melakukan
rekonsiliasi nasional dan mengantisipasi
pertumbuhan terorisme. Qatar sejatinya
menjadi negara yang cukup punya relasi
dekat dengan Afghanistan. Perjanjian
antara AS -Afghanistan yang membuat
pasukan AS dipulangkan b ahkan
berlangsung di Qatar. Akhund
menyampaikan terima kasih kepada
Qatar.

Turki juga tekah melakukan kontak politik
dengan Taliban, salah satunya yakni
meminta berbagai golongan selain Taliban
agar dimasukkan ke roda pemerintahan.
Kemudian Turki juga me mbahas tentang
upaya perlindungan pengungsi
Afghanistan di Turki. Hal tersebut
disampaikan Menlu Mevlut Cavosoglu
kepada Menlu Afghanistan Amir Khan di
Ankara tanggal 15 Oktober 2021. Amir
Khan juga meminta dukungan Turki dalam

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
53

hal investasi dan bantuan ke manusiaan,
termasuk pemberdayaan perempuan.

Negara yang intensif melakukan kontak
dengan Taliban salah satunya adalah AS.
Perwakilan AS dan Taliban bertemu di
Doha tanggal 9 -10 Oktober 2021. Mereka
membahas tentang tindak lanjut perjanjian
pada bulan Feb ruari dan isu terorisme.
Meskipun demikian, Taliban menyatakan
mereka tidak ingin menerima bantuan anti-
terorisme dari AS. Pihak AS juga meminta
kepada Taliban agar memudahkan para
warga negara Amerika Serikat dan warga
negara asing lainnya saat ingin
meninggalkan Afghanistan.

Tantangan Multi Sektor
Masalah yang dihadapi bangsa
Afghanistan sangat begitu kompleks.
Tidak hanya gangguan atau instabilitas
keamanan, konflik internal dan terorisme,
tetapi negeri ini sekian lama juga dibelit
berbagai masalah sosial, ekonomi dan
teknis lainnya. Perang yang telah
berlangsung lebih dari dua dekade
menghancurkan berbagai sektor
kehidupan. Infrastruktur seperti jalan,
irigasi dan sarana produksi hancur karena
perang. Kondisi ini menyebabkan
kekeringan dan kelangkaa n pangan.
Akibatnya, sektor pertanian mengalami
kerugian dan kemiskinan menjadi
meningkat. Fenomena kemiskinan itu
terjadi dalam skala besar karena sekitar
70% warga Afghanistan tinggal di daerah
pedesaan atau lahan pertanian, dan
sekitar 61% pendapatan wa rga berasal
dari sektor pertanian.9

Berbagai laporan dari lembaga
internasional seperti UNHCR dan
International Crisis Group (ICR) menyebut
kondisi Afghanistan makin memburuk
setelah satu bulan pemerintahan Taliban.
Selain mandegnya aktivitas ekonomi
(ekspor-import), pemerintah Taliban
menghadapi krisis dukungan dunia
internasional. Belum ada negara yang
secara resmi memberikan pengakuan
kepada pemerintah Taliban. Beberapa
organisasi dunia seperti Bank Dunia dalam
hal ini juga menangguhkan bantuan atau
pinjaman kepada pemerintah Taliban.

Ketergantungan Bantuan Internasional
Afghanistan merupakan salah satu negara
yang telah bergantung pada bantuan
internasional. Selama dua dekade terakhir
(2001-2021), pemerintah Afghanistan
mengandalkan bantuan asing unt uk
menjalankan roda pemerintahannya.
Mandegnya sektor industri dan produksi
membuat perekonomian negara menjadi

rentan, serta membuat ketergantungan
dengan dana internasional turut menjadi
cukup tinggi. Partumbuhan ekonomi rata -
rata Afghanistan selama sepu luh tahun
terakhir juga cukup rendah, sekitar 2-3%.

Data dari Bank Dunia menunjukkan 42,9%
PDB Afghanistan pada tahun 2020 berasal
dari bantuan dana internasional.10 Amerika
Serikat, Uni Eropa dan organisasi
multinasional adalah donatur utama. Saat
Taliban berkuasa, AS menghentikan
seluruh bantuan ekonomi. Pemerintah AS
malah membekukan asset bank sentral
Afghanistan (Da Afghanistan bank) senilai
US$ 9 miliar yang dis impan di AS.
Absennya dana internasional ini menjadi
tantangan bagi Taliban dalam membangun
Afghanistan.

10 The World Bank
Masalah pandemi COVID -19 makin
memperburuk perekonomian nasional
Afghanistan. Sektor kesehatan kewalahan
menangani warga yang terinfeksi. Menteri
kesehatan, Ahmad Jawad Osmani
menyatakan jutaan warga telah terpapar
tanpa mendapat perawatan yang
memadai.11

Selama tahun 2001 -2021, tercatat ada
sekitar 51.613 warga Afghanistan yang
meninggal akibat konflik, ribuan luka -luka
dan 2,6 juta orang menjadi pengun gsi.
Angka tersebut mendorong PBB
mengkategorikan Afghanistan sebagai
negara terbesar ketiga dengan jumlah
warga terlantar terbanyak di dunia setelah
Suriah dan Venezuela. 12  PBB kemudian

memperingatkan bakal makin banyak

Afghanistan jika situasi politik dan

permasalahan akut di Afghanistan. PBB

Afghanistan sebagai neg ara paling miskin
di dunia. Situasi itu tentu akan membuat
catatan kemiskinan di Afghanistan
memburuk, karena garis kemiskinan di
Afghanistan sempat tercatat terus
meningkat dari tahun 2007 -2016
sebagaimana digambarkan melalui grafik
di bawah.


Gambar 4 . Grafik Tingkat Kemiskinan di
Afghanistan

Konflik yang berlangsung di Afghanistan
selama dua dekade memang telah
menghancurkan berbagai aspek
kehidupan. Berbagai laporan Lembaga
internasional menyimpulkan kalau
Afghanistan mengalami permasalahan
kompleks. Pemerintahan Taliban dalam
hal ini dipastikan bakal menghadapi
berbagai tantangan sulit dalam
menjalankan kekuasaannya. Jika krisis
ekonomi tidak ditangani dengan baik,
maka kemungkinan terjadinya krisis
kemanusiaan menjadi  besar. Mereka
harus menemukan solusi untuk
menyelesaikan masalah -masalah yang
ada.

Seperti laporan Bank Dunia, PBB dan
lembaga internasional lainnya, data
Fragile State Index (FSI) juga
menunjukkan suramnya nasib
Afghanistan. Penghitungan data FSI ini
makin menegaskan kalau Afghanistan
menghadapi berbagai tantangan yang

begitu kompleks. Berbagai segi
perekonomian negara ini hancur
dikarenakan konflik yang berlanjut dalam
beberapa dekade. Pada tahun 2021,
indeks kerentanan Afghanistan berada di
angka 102.1. Skor ini menempatkan
Afghanistan sebagai negara ke -9 dengan
tingkat kerentanan tert inggi di dunia,
setelah Yaman, Sudan Selatan, Chad,
Sudan, Republik Afrika Tengah, Kongo,
Suriah, dan Somalia.

Adapun beberapa variabel yang
menujukkan tingkat kerentanan yang akut
seperti di Afghanistan adalah aspek
ekonomi dan kesenjangan ekonomi
(economic inequality ). Kedua variabel ini
menunjukkan trend ‘memburuk’
(worsening). Pelayanan publik ( Public
service) juga semakin memburuk
dikarenakan permasalahan ekonomi yang
juga makin menurun.

Afghanistan: Ancaman Krisis
Kemanusiaan
Afghanistan saat ini terancam atau bahkan
telah masuk dalam fase krisis
kemanusiaan. Negeri yang telah tercabik -
cabik perang ini menghadapi
permasalahan besar terkait
keberlangsungan hidup rakyatnya.
Mandegnya aktivitas ekonomi mulai
menimbulkan berbagai masalah sosial,
seperti kelangkaan bahan makanan dan
logistik lainnya. Harga bahan makanan
mulai naik di tengah makin menurunnya
daya beli masyarakat. Sebagai contoh,
harga bensin meningkat hingga 75%, lalu
sayuran meningkat hingga 50%, dan
peningkatan harga kebutuhan dasar
lainnya. Kondisi ekonomi yang memburuk
juga menyebabkan langkanya peredaran
uang di masyarakat. Terkait kelangkaan
peredaran uang ini, pemerintah Taliban
memutuskan untuk tidak mengizinkan
warganya menarik uang di bank di atas
US$ 200 per minggu. 13  Peraturan ini
menyebabkan antrean panjang di bank.
Selain itu, pasukan dan milisi Taliban
dilaporkan juga belum mendapatkan gaji
dalam bulan terakhir ini.

Sekjen PBB, Antonio Guterres
menyatakan bahwa krisis kemanusiaan
telah terjadi di Afghanistan. Pernyataan
tersebut dikeluarkan pada tanggal 13
September 2021 dalam pertemuan High -
Level Ministerial Meeting on Humanitrian
Situation. Guterres juga menyerukan
penggalangan bantuan kemanusiaan
senilai lebih dari US$ 600 juta untuk 11
juta warga Afghanistan hingga ak hir tahun
2021. Sejauh ini, Guterres telah
mengamankan komitmen pemberian

bantuan senilai US$ 1 milyar untuk
membantu Afghanistan.

PBB melalui laporannya menunjukkan ada
peningkatan vulnerability di Afghanistan
setelah sekian lama mengalami perang
dan kekerasan konflik. Laporan PBB juga
menyebutkan bahwa sekitar 97% populasi
Afghanistan akan hidup di bawah garis
kemiskinan dalam pemerintahan Taliban.
Sebelum Taliban mengambil alih
kekuasaan, sekit ar 72% penduduknya
padahal sudah hidup dibawah garis
kemiskinan. Ketua UNHCR, Filippo Grandi
menyebutkan akan melakukan asesmen
terkait bantuan kemanusiaan untuk 3,5
juta pengungsi Afghanistan, termasuk di
dalamnya sekitar 500 ribu pengungsi pada
tahun ini.

Selain menghadapi instabilitas keamanan,
Afghanistan di bawah pemerintahan
Taliban juga mengalami berbagai masalah
pelik seperti kekeringan, krisis bahan
makanan dan pandemi Covid -19.
Berdasarkan laporan Global Hunger Index
(GHI) tahun 2020, Afghanistan  berada di
ranking terendah nomor 99 dari 107 yang
menghadapi bahaya kelaparan. Skor GHI
Afghanistan mencapai 30,3, sehingga
masuk pada kategori serius. 14  Terkait

14
https://www.globalhungerindex.org/afghanistan.html
Kategori low (kurang dari 9,9), moderate (10.00-19,9),
pandemi Covid, lebih dari 150 ribu kasus
tercatat pada tahun 2021. Potensi
bertambahnya jumlah  kasus juga masih
cukup besar. Hal itu tentu akan semakin
menjerumuskan Afghanistan ke situasi
yang lebih terpuruk.

Peran Indonesia di Afghanistan
Bagaimana kebijakan luar negeri
Indonesia terkait perkembangan politik di
Afghanistan? Apa kepentingan dan sikap
pemerintah Indonesia terhadap Taliban
sebagai penguasa baru Afghanistan?
Berbagai pertanyaan ini penting untuk
dicarikan jawabannya agar perumusan
kebijakan luar negeri Indonesia sesuai
kepentingan nasionalnya.

Pemerintah Indonesia pada dasarnya
telah sekian lama menjalin hubungan
persaudaraan yang dekat dengan
Afghanistan. Melalui politik luar negeri
“bebas dan aktif,” Indonesia menganggap
Afghanistan sebagai negara sahabat.
Terlebih, kedua negara juga sebelumnya
terlibat aktif dalam Gerakan Non -Blok.
Saat terbentuknya pemerintahan
Afghanistan (2001 -2014), pemerintah
Indonesia menjalin hubungan bilateral
yang erat serta memberikan beberapa
bantuan teknis pembangunan. Hubungan
ini makin erat saat Presiden Asraf Ghani

serius (20.0-34,9), alarming (35.0-499) dan extremly
alarming (lebih besar dari angka 50.0)

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
58

menggantikan Hamid Kharzai. Di ma sa
pemerintahan Asraf Ghani, Presiden Joko
Widodo bahkan sempat melakukan
kunjungan kenegaraan di Kabul pada
bulan Januari 2018.

Pemerintahan Indonesia telah berusaha
menjadi mediator untuk mengakhiri konflik
internal antara pemerintah Afghanistan
dengan Taliban. 15  Tidak saja berperan
sebagai penengah ( peace broker ),
pemerintah Indonesia juga meyalurkan
berbagai bantuan teknis dan
pembangunan, seperti komitmen senilai
US$ 10 juta untuk membantu kegiatan
pemberdayaan perempuan, perbaikan tata
kelola, pembinaan UMKM, dan bantuan
teknis lainnya. Indonesia juga telah
mendirikan masjid dan rumah sakit di
Kabul sebagai bentuk persahabatan dan
dukungan kepada rakyat Afghanistan.

Saat Taliban berkuasa kembali bulan
Agustus 2021, Pemerintah Indonesia juga
aktif mendorong terwujudnya perdamaian
dan stabilitas politik. Indonesia
menekankan penyelesaian politik harus
dilakukan melalui pendekatan Afghan-
owned, Afghan-led. Selain itu, pemerintah
Indonesia juga mendorong pemerintah
Taliban agar menghormati HAM serta

15 Presiden Republik Indonesia Joko Widodo pernah
mengunjungi Kabul pada bulan Januari 2018 untuk
bertemu Asraf Ghani
perlindungan perempuan dan minoritas.
Sejalan dengan harapan terbentuknya
stabilitas keamanan, Indonesia juga
mendorong agar Taliban tidak
mengizinkan beroperasinya organisasi
teroris di tanah Afghanistan.

Indonesia sebenarnya tidak memiliki
kepentingan terselubung ( vested interest )
di Afghanistan. Hal ini ditekankan Menlu
Retno Marsudi yang menyebut kalau
Pemerintah Indonesia hanya ingin
terciptanya perdamaian dan stabilitas di
negara itu. Sejalan dengan harapan
tersebut, Indonesia juga mendorong agar
pemerintah Taliban dapat menujukkan
komitmen kepada dunia internasional.

Diplomasi untuk mengatasi krisis
kemanusian ( humanitarian diplomacy ) di
Afghanistan dapat terus dilakukan
pemerintah Indonesia. Sebelumnya, dalam
Pertemuan Tinggi Tingkat Menteri PBB
Tentang Situasi Kemanusiaan pada
tanggal 13 September 2021, Menteri
Retno Marsudi menyampaikan bahwa
Indonesia akan memberi dana sebesar 3
juta US dolar untuk membantu masalah
kemanusiaan di Afghanistan. Bantuan
tersebut nantinya akan disalurkan melalui
mitra lokal yang terpercaya. 16  Adanya

Afghanistan: Minister of Foreign Affairs,
https://setkab.go.id/en/indonesia-provides-us-3-

Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
59

bantuan seperti itu menunjukkan bahwa
Indonesia tetap akan berusaha menjaga
relasi persaudaaan dengan warga
Afghanistan. Meski telah memindahkan
misi diplomatiknya dari Kabul, Indonesia
tetap harus memantau dan terlibat dalam
upaya pemberian bantuan kemanusiaan
kepada rakyat Afghanistan.

Meski berjarak jauh dengan Afghanistan,
Indonesia tetap berupaya agar stabilitas di
negara itu terbentuk. Goncangan
keamanan di Afghanistan tidak hanya
berdampak bagi negara -negara kawas an,
namun juga bagi dunia internasional,
termasuk Indonesia. Setidaknya ada dua
alasan mengapa Indonesia
berkepentingan agar Afghanistan tumbuh
menjadi negara yang aman, damai dan
stabil. Pertama, Indonesia ingin agar
radikalisme dan terorisme tidak
berkembang di Afghanistan. Jika
kelompok teroris berkembang, maka
aktivitas terror tersebut akan berpotensi
menjalar ke Indonesia. Sebagaimana
pengalaman teror di Indonesia tahun
1990-2000an, banyak pelaku bom di tanah
air sebelumnya pernah belajar atau
mengikuti pelatihan militer pada kelompok-
kelompok radikal di Afghanistan. Maka
dari itu Indonesia berupaya agar tidak
tercipta ruang aman ( safehaven) bagi

million-aid-for-afghanistan-minister-of-foreign-
affairs/
kelompok radikal maupun teroris untuk
berkembang di Afghanistan. Kedua,
Indonesia berpotensi akan menerima
limpahan pengungsi Afghanistan,
meskipun Indonesia bukan menjadi
negara tujuan utama. Limpahan pengungsi
ini dapat terjadi akibat krisis kemanusiaan
dan instabilitas politik yang terjadi.

KESIMPULAN
Masih terlalu dini untuk menyimpulkan
Taliban telah berubah menjadi Taliban
Baru ( New Taliban ) dengan predikat
moderat, inklusif, menghormati HAM,
kaum minoritas dan wanita. Namun, terlalu
awal juga untuk menilai Taliban gagal
mewujudkan komitmennya. Terkait hal ini,
masyarakat internasional perlu
memberikan waktu untuk dilakukannya
proses dan tra nsformasi politik yang
dilakukan Taliban. Lalu, dunia
internasional juga harus terus memonitor
bahkan mendorong Taliban untuk
menepati komitmen -komitmen politiknya
sesuai hukum dan nilai-nilai internasional.

Pemerintah Taliban dipastikan akan
menghadapi tantangan-tantangan sulit
dalam menjalankan pemerintahannya.
Kondisi Afghanistan masih jauh dari
perdamaian dan stabilitas keamanan.
Konflik internal, gangguan keamanan, dan
potensi instabilitas kedepannya masih
menghantui Afghanistan. Hal ini

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
60

diperparah d engan masih kompleksnya
permasalahan yang dihadapi, seperti
kemiskinan, masalah pengungsi, pandemi
Covid-19 dan berbagai masalah kronik
lainnya.

Namun, suka atau tidak, Pemerintah
Taliban adalah penguasa di Afghanistan.
Taliban mengontrol sebagai besar w ilayah
Afghanistan, memiliki kekuatan militer
layaknya seperti negara dan menentukan
kebijakan yang berdampak langsung bagi
rakyat Afghanistan. Masih banyak negara
yang saat ini memutuskan untuk “ wait and
see.” Negara -negara Barat cenderung
skeptis, curiga  bahkan menerapkan
langkah kebijakan “ disengagement”
dengan Taliban. Namun, pendekatan “wait
and see” tersebut tidaklah harus bersifat
pasif, sebaliknya harus dapat bersifat
“constructive engagement.”

Pendekatan politik dapat menjadi salah
satu opsi bagi dunia internasional meski
tidak harus dengan pemberian pengakuan
diplomatik. Kebijakan unilateral yang
kontraproduktif seperti pemberian sanksi
ekonomi atau hukuman lainnya tampaknya
kurang efektif. Kebijakan sepihak ini justru
hanya dapat memperburuk kond isi krisis
yang dialami warga Afghanistan. Dengan
kata lain, dunia internasional harus tetap
memberi perhatian dan bantuan karena
makin bergolaknya Afghanistan dapat
menjalar ke negara -negara tetangga, atau
bahkan lebih luas lagi. Indonesia pada
saat yang bersamaan perlu juga untuk
mengantisipasi krisis di Afghanistas yang
mendorong membanjirnya pengungsi dari
Afghanistan.

Sejarah mengajarkan bahwa bangsa
Afghanistan perlu belajar dari masa
lalunya. Sejarah juga mengajarkan bahwa
tidak ada satupun kekuata n asing yang
dapat menguasai negeri ini. Artinya,
Pemerintah Taliban perlu belajar dari
sejarah ini. Mereka perlu melibatkan
kelompok-kelompok etnis lain jika ingin
membentuk pemerintahan yang inklusif,
kuat dan didukung dunia internasional.
Pemerintah Tal iban dalam hal ini perlu
memberi komitmen tinggi pada proses
pembagian kekuasaan ( power sharing ).
Mereka harus senantiasa menjaga
moderasi, inklusivitas, toleransi dan
pembangunan nasional. Jika tidak, maka
konflik berkepanjangan kemungkinan
besar masih ak an terus terjadi. Dan, yang
paling menderita sebagai korban perang
adalah rakyat Afghanistan sendiri.

Kepercayaan atau dukungan masyarakat
dunia saat ini sangat dibutuhkan Taliban.
Indonesia sebagai bagian dari masyarakat
dunia perlu terus mengambil peran . Peran
ini tentunya tidak hanya harus melalui first
track diplomacy, namun juga dapat

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
61

melibatkan pihak kedua ( second track ),
selain melalui forum multilateral di PBB
maupun OKI. Kebijakan “ constructive
engagement” oleh komunitas internasional
harus ada sebagai upaya kolektif untuk
menginisiasi, mendorong dan menciptakan
perdamaian yang langgeng di Afghanistan.

INDONESIA SEABED MINERAL ACT:
Urgensi dan Arah Pengaturan

Marsudi Triatmodjo, Agustina Merdekawati, dan Nugroho Adhi Pratama
Fakultas Hukum - Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia


Abstrak
Indonesia belum memiliki regulasi nasional yang mengatur mengenai Area (seabed mineral act ). Hal ini
menimbulkan beberapa permasalahan khususnya berkaitan dengan terhambatnya peran Indonesia
berkaitan dengan akses penambangan di Area. Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian hukum normatif yang
akan merumuskan bagaimana urgensi dan arah pengaturan seabed mineral act Indonesia dimasa
mendatang. Hasil penelitian menunjukan bahwa Indonesia sudah seharusnya segera membentuk seabed
mineral act khususnya dalam rangka percepatan partisipasi Indonesia di Area. Mengenai arah
pengaturannya sendiri Indonesia harus mengacu pada hukum internasional dan juga praktik negara -
negara di dunia dengan mempertimbangkan pula kepentingan nasionalnya.

Kata Kunci: Seabed mineral act, Indonesia, Area

LATAR BELAKANG
Indonesia memiliki hak untuk
mengeksplorasi dan mengeksploitasi
sumber daya mineral di Area (UNCLOS,
1982: Article 133). Hak tersebut didasarkan
pada prinsip  common heritage of mankind
(CHM) yang diatur dalam Article 136 Part XI
the United Nations Convention on the Law
of the Sea  (UNCLOS 1982). Rezim hukum
CHM memberikan kesempatan partisipasi
yang seluas -luasnya bagi negara di dunia
untuk memanfaatkan sumber daya mineral
di Area berdasarkan mekanisme kontrol
yang dalam hal ini dilakukan oleh
International Seabed Authority (Edward
Gungtrip, 2017). Hingga tahun 2021,
setidaknya terdapat 31 kontrak aktif yang
melakukan eksplorasi di Area (ISA, 2021).

Indonesia merupakan salah satu negara
yang aktif berperan di ISA. Dalam beberapa
kesempatan, Indonesia menjadi salah satu
Dewan ISA dalam hal ini pada grub C dan E
(ISA, 2021). Grub C terdiri dari empat
negara anggota ISA yang merupakan
pengekspor utama dari kategori  mineral-
mineral yang memiliki kandungan sama
dengan mineral yang berasal dari Area.
Sedangkan Grub E terdiri dari delapan
belas anggota ISA dengan mekanisme
"prinsip distribusi geografis yang adil"
dimana Indonesia mewakili kawasan
geografis Asia -Pasifik. Dengan
bergabungnya Indonesia dalam dewan ISA,
tentu Indonesia memiliki peran yang cukup

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
64

signifikan terutama dalam pembentukan
hukum mengenai Area di level internasional.

Namun sayangnya posisi strategis
Indonesia dalam ISA tersebut tidak dikuti
dengan peran aktif Indonesia dalam
pemanfaatan (pertambangan) Area baik
sebagai kontraktor maupun Negara sponsor.
Ketiadaan hukum domestik yang mengatur
mengenai Area atau disebut sebagai
seabed m ineral act diduga menjadi salah
satu alasan akan asbennya peran indonesia
tersebut (Ilham Putuhena, 2019).
Terhambatnya implementasi Article 153
UNCLOS 1982 “mekanisme penerbitan
sponsor” merupakan salah satu
implikasinya.

Pasal 153 (4) UNCLOS 1982 sendi ri
menyatakan bahwa " …States Parties shall
assist the Authority by taking all measures
necessary to ensure such compliance in
accordance with Article 139... ".  Penjabaran
terkait dengan hal tersebut dijelaskan dalam
Annex III, Article 4 (4) of UNCLOS 1982
"The sponsoring State or States shall,
pursuant to Article 139, have the
responsibility to ensure, within their legal
systems, ... ". Dari kedua pasal tersebut,
terlihat bahwa diksi " shall" sendiri
menunjukan adanya seabed mineral act
merupakan kewajiban dari negara yang
ingin menerbitkan sponsor bagi suatu pihak
khususnya berkaitan dengan "responsibility
to ensure compliance and liability for
damage" sebagaimana Article 139
UNCLOS 1982 (Bryan Garner, 1999).

Pengaturan s ecara khusus  dalam hukum
domestik juga untuk memastikan " effective
control" dari negara bersangkutan kepada
kontraktor yang di sponsori tersebut. Selain
itu, hukum nasional -lah yang juga
memberikan batasan mengenai badan
hukum yang berhak mengajukan sponsor,
yang dalam hal ini hubungan tersebut dalam
hukum internasional dikenal sebagai " a
direct link" atau biasa juga disebut sebagai
"a genuine connection" (D. French, 2011).

Menyadari pentingnya eksistensi seabed
mineral act , pada tahun 2011 Dewan ISA
meminta Sekretaris Jenderal untuk
menyiapkan laporan tentang undang -
undang, peraturan dan tindakan
administratif yang diadopsi oleh Negara -
negara sponsor dan anggota ISA lainnya
sehubungan dengan kegiatan di Area (ISA,
2011). Pada tahun 2012, Dewan
menjadikan masalah tersebut sebagai  poin
pembahasan tetap dalam agendanya dan
meminta Sekretaris Jenderal untuk
menyiapkan laporan terbaru setiap tahun.

Merujuk pada berbagai pertimbangan
tersebut, ketiadaan hukum domestik seakan
akan "mematikan" kesempatan bagi calon
kontraktor yang ingi n terlibat secara aktif

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
65

dalam pemanfaatan Area termasuk
kontraktor yang berasal dari Indonesia.
Pihak-pihak tersebut tidak bisa langsung
meminta izin kepada ISA mengingat
memang penerbitan izin baik eksplorasi
maupun eksploitasi haruslah mendapatkan
sponsor dari suatu negara. Sisi penting
kehadiran Indonesia seabed mineral act  ini
juga dipicu telah  adanya tawaran negara
yang ingin mengajukan kerja sama dalam
eksplorasi dan eksploitasi penambangan di
Area, salah satunya kontraktor dari Polandia.

Pada akhirnya ketiadaan Indonesia seabed
mineral act  tersebut seakan menjadikan
Indonesia absen dalam ke wajiban
internasionalnya khususnya berkaitan
dengan kewajiban due dilligence kegiatan
pertambangan di Area yang dalam hal ini
bisa dilakukan Indonesia melalui
mekanisme sponsor mendistorsi keaktivan
Indonesia dalam ISA dimana hal tersebut
sudah menjadi age nda utama untuk di
implementasikan ke masing -masing
anggota ISA. Dengan demikian, menyadari
bahwa mineral di Area merupakan sumber
daya alam yang tidak dapat diperbarui dan
juga melihat bahwa negara berkembang
seperti Indonesia mendapatkan afirmasi dari
hukum internasional, artikel ini akan
menguraikan "bagaimana urgensi dan arah
instrumen kebijakan yang tepat khususnya
bagi Indonesia berkaitan dengan seabed
mineral act di masa mendatang".
METODE PENELITIAN
Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian
normative. Data yang digunakan dalam
penelitian ini adalah data sekunder yang
terdiri dari bahan hukum primer dan bahan
hukum sekunder. Cara pengumpulan data
yang dilakukan dalam penelitian ini adalah
menggunakan teknik studi kepustakaan
(literature research ). Metode  analisis
dilakukan dengan metode analisis sintesis.
Penarikan kesimpulan dilakukan dengan
cara interpretasi untuk memahami maksud
suatu peraturan dan sumber hukum
lainnya

DISKUSI DAN ANALISIS
1. Urgensi Pengaturan Seabed Mineral
Act
Pembentukan seabed mineral act bukanlah
hal baru dimana sebelum adanya UNCLOS
1982, beberapa negara di dunia sudah
memiliki seabed mineral act. Seabed
Mineral Act sendiri dapat dimaknai sebagai
seperangkat regulasi nasional yang
mengatur mengenai bagaimana suatu
negara dapat ber partisipasi khususnya
dalam penambangan di Area. Seabed
mineral act sendiri merupakan salah satu
bentuk implementasi dari kewajiban due
dilligence dimana secara tidak langsung
memberikan kewajiban bagi negara yang
nantinya berpartisipasi dalam penambangan
di Area untuk memiliki National Legislation.

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
66

Untuk melihat perkembangan sejarah
pembentukan seabed mineral act  oleh
negara-negara, maka penulis akan
mengacu pada  periodisasi yang dilakukan
ISA. Periode pertama  mengacu pada
undang-undang yang diadopsi pada tahun
sebelum 1980. Instrumen pertama tersebut
misalnya US Deep Seabed Hard Mineral
Resource Act of 1980, yang menyediakan
“an interim procedure for the orderly
development of hard mineral resources in
the deep seabed pending adoption of an
international regime”. Undang -undang
tersebut memberikan skema untuk
pengaturan penambangan Area, antara lain
melarang eksplorasi mineral kecuali
dilisensikan oleh Amerika Serikat atau
diizinkan oleh perjanjian internasional yang
berlaku untuk Amerika Serikat. Undang -
undang serupa pada periode pertama ini
juga diadopsi oleh negara -negara lain
seperti Jerman, Inggris, Prancis, Jepang,
dan Italia. Pada periode tersebut, tentunya
regulasi mengenai Area masihlah bersifat
sementara dan belum memiliki status
hukum yang jelas m engingat rezim hukum
internasional m engenai Area sendiri
belumlah terbentuk. Periode kedua
mengacu pada undang -undang yang
diadopsi setelah berlakunya UNCLOS 1982
dan sebelum dikeluarkannya Advisory
Opinion of the Seabed Chamber of the
ITLOS 2011. Negara y ang kemudian
membentuk seabed mineral act pada
periode ini meliputi Rusia, jerman, New
Zealand, dan Ceko. Pada periode tersebut,
negara-negara mulai mempertimbangkan
mengenai rezim hukum Area seperti
keberlakuan prinsip  Common Heritage of
Mankind (CHM) dan masih tahap awal
dalam pembentukan mekanisme teknis
penambangan itu sendiri mengingat draf
regulasi baik eksplorasi maupun eksploitasi
masih belum terbentuk.

Periode ketiga  mengacu pada undang -
undang yang diadopsi atau diubah setelah
penerbitan Advisory Opinion of the Seabed
Chamber of the ITLOS pada tahun 2011
(AO ITLOS 2011)  Dalam hal ini, negara -
negara mulai mempertimbangkan mengenai
sejauh mana pengaturan dan tanggung
jawab dari negara -negara khususnya
berkaitan dengan keperluan sponsor.
Termasuk dalam periode ini adalah negara -
negara seperti: Belgia, Fiji, Inggris
(amandemen), Tonga, Tuvalu, Singapura,
Nauru, China, Kiribati, dan Perancis  (ISA,
2021). Dari periodisasi tersebut, terlihat
bahwa seabed mineral act merupkan praktik
negara yang sudah lama di praktikkan
sebagai payung hukum atas hubungan
kontraktor dan Negara sponsor dalam
pemanfaataan Area.

Kemudian, merujuk dalam rezim hukum a
quo, urgensi adanya seabed mineral act
berkaitan dengan kepentingan suatu negara

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
67

yang ingin menggunakan mekanisme
sponsor. Sebagaimana diatur dalam Pasal
153 UNCLOS 1982, negara sponsor
berkewajiban untuk memiliki instrumen
hukum domestik guna memastikan
kepatuhan dari kontraktor dalam kegiatan di
Area. Dari 22 kontrak eksploitasi yang ada,
19 negara sudah memiliki hukum domestik
mengenai Area yang sudah di depositkan
dalam database ISA. Negara -negara
tersebut adalah Kuba, Ceko, Russia, China,
Jepang, Perancis, Jerman, Nauru, Tonga,
Belgia, UK, Kiribati, Singapura, Cook Island,
Jamaika, Brazil, India, dan Korea  (ISA,
2021). Sedangkan untuk ketiga negara lain
yang belum memiliki seabed mineral act
adalah Bulgaria, Slovakia, dan Polandia.

Praktik negara tersebut menunjukkan
bahwa mayoritas negara-negara yang ingin
mengelola Area baik menggunakan
mekanisme sponsor maupun dikelola oleh
negara bersangkutan secara langsung
sudah memiliki hukum domestik mengenai
Area. Dari praktik negara tersebut juga
dapat disimpulkan bahwa meskipun seabed
mineral act  memiliki peran , namun masih
banyak negara peserta UNCLOS 1982 yang
belum mengimplementasikannya bahkan
termasuk Negara -negara yang sec ara aktif
sudah berpartisipasi dalam pemanfaatan di
Area. Kondisi ini dikarenakan pengaturan
mengenai Area merupakan pengaturan
yang cukup kompleks, negara -negara
nampaknya masih memerlukan waktu
adaptasi untuk mengerti dan
mengejawantahkannya dalam hukum
domestik (Michael Lodge, 2018). Ketiadaan
mekanisme pemberlakuan sanksi kepada
Negara yang tidak memiliki seabed mineral
act juga turut berkontribusi kurang
massifnya Negara mengusahakan segera
terbitnya seabed mineral act.

Hingga saat ini juga belum ada regulasi
yang secara expressive verbis  mengatur
pencantuman kewajiban penerbitan seabed
mineral act  sebagai syarat dapat
diprosesnya kontrak antara kontraktor
dengan ISA. ISA melalui ISBA/17/C/20
justru lebih mengedepankan ajakan dan
mekanisme laporan tahunan untuk meninjau
negara mana saja yang sudah memiliki
hukum domestik terkait Area.

Situasi paska  penerbitan AO ITLOS 2011
berbeda, negara-negara yang belum
mengajukan permohonan eksplorasi pun
telah menunjukkan minatnya untuk memiliki
seabed mineral act . Beberapa Negara
bahkan telah berhasil menerbitkan seabed
mineral act  misalnya Republic Ecuador,
Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji,
Georgia, Guyana, Kenya, Mexico,
Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Niue,
Oman, Pacific Island Region, United States
of America, dan Zambia. Situasi ini makin
menegaskan betapa pentingnya seabed

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
68

mineral act  baik bagi  negara yang sudah
berperan aktif maupun negara yang masih
memiliki rencana untuk berperan aktif di
kemudian harinya.

AO ITLOS 2011 menyatakan bahwa
kepemilikan seabed mineral act bukanlah
kewajiban namun justru hak yang akan
membawa keunt ungan bagi Negara
tersebut (ITLOS, 2011):
"The Convention requires the
sponsoring State to adopt, within its
legal system, laws and regulations
and to take administrative measures
that have two distinct functions,
namely, to ensure compliance by the
contractor with its obligations and to
exempt the sponsoring State from
liability."
Arti penting seabed mineral act  bagi
negara-negara baik yang akan maupun
yang sudah melakukan kegiatan di Area,
adalah sebagai berikut:
a.  Kepastian Hukum Kegiatan di
Area
Praktik negara menunjukkan bahwa
pengaturan mengenai seabed mineral act
memberikan kepastian hukum mengenai
beberapa klausula dalam hal ini khususnya
pembentukan mekanisme untuk
pengawasan aktif terhadap kegiatan
kontraktor yang disponsori dan untuk
koordinasi antara kegiatan Negara sponsor
dan ISA. Dari komparasi yang penulis
lakukan dari seabed mineral act negara-
negara, ditemukan pola pembentukan
sebagai berikut: (1) negara-negara yang
mengatur mengenai secara rinci seperti
Nauru, Kiribati, Tonga dan Cook  Island, (2)
negara – yang tidak  mengatur klausula
secara rinci seperti Ceko, Jerman dan
Singapura. (3) negara -negara yang sudah
memiliki namun pada pengaturannya tidak
spesifik misalnya  Cuba, India, Mexico,
Montenegro, Nigeria, Niue, Oman dan
Zambia (ISA, 2021) . Disparitas pengaturan
yang tampak dari praktik negara -negara
tersebut menunjukan bahwa UNCLOS
memberikan kebebasan kepada setiap
negara untuk mengatur detail materi apa
yang akan diatur dalam seabed mineral act.

Aplikasi seabed mineral act dalam praktik di
Nauru, terlihat bahwa seabed mineral act
berfungsi untuk mempromosikan tata kelola
yang baik dengan membentuk Nauru
Seabed Mineral Authority yang akan
bertanggung jawab untuk memantau dan
mengelola keterlibatan Nauru dengan
kegiatan minera l dasar laut. Pendapatan
yang dihasilkan oleh lembaga dan kontrak
sponsor yang ada, akan diberikan ke dalam
"Seabed Minerals Fund " yang ditetapkan
oleh Undang -Undang, yang akan dikelola
untuk kepentingan masyarakat Nauru  (SPC
EU, 2015). Sementara aplikasi seabed
mineral act  dalam praktik di Kiribati
menunjukkan bahwa seabed  mineral act
telah menjadi payung hukum dalam jaminan

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
69

perlindungan lingkungan selama
pemanfataan Area. (Tearinaki Tanielu,
2013).

Dengan demikian, terlihat bahwa kepastian
hukum yang ada  diharapkan dapat
memberikan tambahan manfaat khususnya
dalam hal ekonomi bagi masyarakat negara
bersangkutan dan juga perlindungan
lingkungan dalam kegiatan pertambangan di
Area agar sesuai dengan hukum
internasional yang ada.

b. Kewajiban "Due Dilligence"
Adanya seabed mineral act juga
menghindarkan per tanggung jawaban
negara jika di kemudian hari dit emukan
bahwa kontraktor yang di sponsorinya
melakukan pelanggaran hukum
internasional yang mengakibatkan
kerusakan sebagaimana Annex III Article 4
(4) UNCLOS 1982 yang menyatakan bahwa,
 "A sponsoring State shall not,
however, be liable for damage caused
by any failure of a contractor
sponsored by it to comply with its
obligations if that State Party has
adopted laws and regulations and
taken administrative measures which
are, within the framework of its legal
system, reasonably appropriate for
securing compliance by persons
under its jurisdiction."
Pasal tersebut menunjukkan pentingnya
peran hukum domestik dalam kegiatan di
Area dimana harus dibentuk instrumen
hukum yang "cukup tepat/ reasonably
appropritate" mampu untuk mengontrol
pihak sponsor dalam kegiatan di Area agar
sesuai dengan hukum internasional.
Adapun mengenai ukuran "reasonably
appropritate" sendiri, ITLOS menyimpulkan
bahwa hal tersebut lebih kepada kewajiban
"due diligence ", bahwa Negara -negara
sponsor harus melakukan "upaya
terbaik/best possible effort " dalam
mengambil langkah -langkah yang
"reasonably appropriate", yang harus terdiri
dari undang -undang ( seabed mineral act ),
peraturan (aturan pelaksana), dan tindakan
administratif. Lebih lanjut, mengenai
klausula minimal dan bagaimana
pembentukannya sendiri, ITLOS
membebaskan kepada masing -masing
negara untuk mengatur berdasarkan
karakteristik dan kebutuhan negara -negara
tersebut yang dalam hal ini dijelaskan
bahwa: "The spons oring State may find it
necessary, depending upon its legal system,
to include in its domestic law provisions that
are necessary for implementing its
obligations under the Convention" (ITLOS,
2011).

Adapun batasan mengenai pengaturannya
seabed mineral ac t harus tetap sesuai
dengan hukum internasional dalam hal ini
rezim hukum Area sebagaimana diatur
dalam Annex III, article 21, paragraph 3,
UNCLOS 1982 yang menyatakan bahwa;

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
70

"No State Party may impose
conditions on a contractor that are
inconsistent with Part XI. However,
the application by a State Party to
contractors sponsored by it, or to
ships flying its flag, of environmental
or other laws and regulations more
stringent t han those in the rules,
regulations and procedures of the
Authority adopted pursuant to article
17, paragraph 2(f), of this Annex shall
not be deemed inconsistent with Part
XI."

Negara-negara yang pada intinya adalah
kepanjangan dari ISA dalam mengelola
mineral yang merupakan warisan seluruh
umat manusia/CHM juga dalam
menentukan seberapa reasonably
appropriate, negara sponsor harus
mempertimbangkan, secara objektif, pilihan-
pilihan yang relevan dengan cara yang
masuk akal, relevan dan kondusif untuk
kepentingan umat manusia secara
keseluruhan. Ia harus bertindak dengan
itikad baik/ good faith , terutama ketika
tindakannya cenderung merugikan
kepentingan umat manusia secara
keseluruhan. Dalam hal ini Setiap
kegagalan di pihak Negara sponsor untuk
bertindak secara wajar dapat di persoalkan
di hadapan Seabed Dispute Chamber
ITLOS berdasarkan pasal 187 (b) (i)
UNCLOS 1982 " The Seabed Disputes
Chamber shall have jurisdiction under this
Part and the Annexes relating thereto in
disputes with respect to activities i n the
Area...".


c. Kewajiban Implementasi UNCLOS
1982 dan Implementing Agreement
1994

Merupakan prinsip dasar hukum
internasional bahwa suatu Negara pihak
pada suatu perjanjian internasional harus
memastikan bahwa hukum dan praktik
domestiknya konsisten  dengan apa yang
disyaratkan oleh perjanjian tersebut (James
Mwandha, n.d). Negara yang telah
menyatakan keterikatannya pada perjanjian
internasional wajib melaksanakan isi
perjanjian internasional tersebut dengan
good faith (iktikad baik) sebagaimana diat ur
dalam Article 26 the Vienna Convention on
the Law of Treaties 1969 (VCLT).
Pemenuhan kewajiban tersebut harus
diposisikan secara secara aktif, artinya
negara harus melakukan suatu tindakan
atau langkah -langkah yang konkrit untuk
melaksanakan isi perjanj ian internasional
(Aminoto dan Merdekawati, 2015). Selain itu
dalam Article 27 VCLT juga menegaskan
bahwa tidak dimungkinkan menggunakan
alasan pemenuhan hukum nasional untuk
menangguhkan pelaksanaan dari sebuah
treaty, kecuali alasan penangguhan sesuai
dengan Article 46 VCLT.
Mempertimbangkan pada ketentuan -
ketentuan diatas dapat disimpulkan bahwa
secara tidak langsung hukum internasional
mengamanahkan tiap negara untuk
kemudian mengimplementasikan atau
mengharmonisasikan perjanjian

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
71

internasional dalam hukum domestik negara
masing-masing dengan iktikad baik.
Indonesia sendiri sudah meratifikasi
UNCLOS pada 1986 dan Impelementation
Agreement 1994 pada tahun 2000. Dengan
demikian, sudah selayaknya Indonesia juga
turut serta mengimplementasikan ketentuan
mengenai Area dalam hukum domestiknya
mengingat UNCLOS 1982 sendiri yang
merupakan law-making treaty yang bersifat
package-deal, sehingga sudah selayaknya
ratifikasi UNCLOS dibarengi dengan
harmonisasi hukum domestik secara penuh
(Hugo Caminos, 1985).

Mengenai urgensi adanya seabed mineral
act khususnya bagi Indonesia, selain dari
pada dua hal diatas adalah berkaitan
dengan a) posisi indonesia seabagi negara
berkembang dan b) politik luar negeri
Indonesia sebagai poros maritim dunia c)
sumber daya alam di Area merupakan non-
renewable resources.


a. Posisi Indonesia sebagai negara
berkembang

Dalam rezim hukum mengenai Area, prinsip
CHM dalam Article 136 UNCLOS 1982
nyatanya memang memberikan afirmasi
bagi negara -negara berkembang. Afirmasi
sebagaimana dimaksud tersebut termuat
dalam berbagai Article, seperti pada Article
148 UNCLOS 1982 yang menyatakan
bahwa: "The effective participation of
developing States in activities in the Area
shall be promoted as specifically provided
for in this Part, having due regard to their
special interests and needs.

Lebih lanjut,  perhatian yang sama juga
terdapat dalam Article 150 dan 152 (2) di
mana dalam ketentuan tersebut dijelaskan
bahwa pelaksanaan kegiatan di Area harus
mempertimbangkan negara berkembang,
serta otorita (dal am hal ini ISA) dalam hal
pemberian pertimbangan wajib memberikan
“berat pertimbangan” terhadap negara
berkembang khususnya landlocked states
dan geographically disadvantaged states.

Selain jaminan yang diberikan sebagaimana
dibahas di atas, UNCLOS 1982 serta
turunannya juga memberikan afirmasi -
afirmasi lain. p emberian afirmasi pada
pengaturan terkait aktivitas di Area pada
UNCLOS 1982 dipandang sebagai
terobosan–terutama dalam mengakomodasi
negara berkembang (Rongxing Guo, 2017).
Dalam kodifikasi hukum l aut internasional
saat ini, afirmasi terhadap negara
berkembang dalam kegiatan pemanfaatan
di Area tak hanya terdapat dalam UNCLOS
1982, namun terdapat pula pada peraturan -
peraturan yang terkait dengannya seperti
dengan Implementation Agreement 1994
serta dalam tiga buah mining code  yang
dikeluarkan oleh ISA. Dalam keseluruhan

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
72

pengaturan tersebut, bentuk afirmasi yang
didapatkan oleh negara berkembang
meliputi:
1) Akses khusus terhadap reserved
Area., dengan demikian, Indonesia
dapat kemudian mengelola Area-Area
khusus yang memang dicandangkan
hanya untuk negara berkembang
dan/atau enterprise.
2) Hak atas Pelatihan. Indonesia dalam
hal ini dapat mengoptimalisasi sumber
daya manusianya untuk kemudian
mendapatkan pelatihan -pelatihan dari
negara-negara maju yang su dah
berkontrak dengan ISA.
3) Hak terhadap akses teknologi
pertambangan. Enterprise dan negara
berkembang diberikan kesempatan
untuk mendapatkan asistensi dari ISA
berupa fasilitasi.
Dengan manfaat Indonesia sebagai negara
berkembang tersebutlah, maka kesempatan
untuk mengelola Area seharusnya dapat di
maksimalkan oleh Indonesia.


b. Politik  Luar Negeri Indonesia
sebagai Poros Maritim Dunia

Indonesia merupakan negara kepulauan
terbesar di dunia yang memiliki potensi
untuk menjadi Poros Maritim Dunia. Hal ini
sebagaimana diatur dalam Peraturan
Presiden Nomor 16 tahun 2017 tentang
Kebijakan Kelautan Indonesia. Dalam
bagian menimbang sendiri secara jelas
dinyatakan bahwa "bahwa pengelolaan
sumber daya kelautan dilakukan dalam
rangka mewujudkan cita -cita Indonesia
sebagai Poros Maritim Dunia dan dalam
upaya memberikan manfaat sebesar -
besarnya bagi kemakmuran rakyat".
Merujuk pada cita-cita tersebut, maka wajar
bagi Indonesia untuk segera melakukan
percepatan pengelolaan Area demi
sebesar-besarnya kemakmuran rakyat .
Pengelolaan Area akan memberikan benefit
berupa tambahan pemasukan Indonesia
khususnya sektor mineral dan juga
bergaining position Indonesia dalam politik
luar negeri mengingat belum banyak negara
yang "berani" mengelola Area hingga tahun
2021 kini. Peng elolaan Area secara
langsung juga sekaligus meneguhkan politik
luar negeri Indonesia dimana dalam level
diplomasi Indonesia sudah sering menjadi
dewan ISA (ISA, 2021).


c. Sumber Daya Alam di Area
merupakan Non -Renewable
Resources
Adapun mekanisme penambangan di Area
adalah menggunakan mekanisme
penambangan nodul/batuan, dimana nodul
tersebut terdiri dari:
1) Nodul polimetalik ( polymetallic
nodules) yang akan menghasilkan
mineral mangan, nikel, tembaga,
kobalt, dan molibdenum (Kathryn

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
73

Milner, 2018). T erregulasi dalam
Regulations on Prospecting and
Exploration for Polymetallic Nodules in
the Area. Diadopsi tanggal 13 July
2000 (ISBA/6/A/18 tanggal 4 October
2000).
2) Sulfida polimetalik (polymetallic
sulphides) yang akan menghasilkan
kandungan tembaga yang  tinggi
dengan pengayaan seng, emas dan
perak. Terregulasi dalam Regulations
on prospecting and exploration for
polymetallic sulphides in the Area .
Diadopsi tanggal 7 May 2010
(ISBA/16/A/12/Rev.1 tanggal 15
November 2010).
3) Lempengan kobalt feromangan
(cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts)
yang akan menghasilkan kandungan
mangan, besi, dan beragam trace
metal (kobalt, tembaga, nikel, dan
platinum). Terregulasi dalam
Regulations on Prospecting and
Exploration for Cobalt -rich
Ferromanganese Crusts in the Area .
Diadopsi tanggal 27 July 2012
(ISBA/18/A/11 tanggal 22 Oktober
2012)

Mineral-mineral yang dihasilkan oleh nodul
tersebut merupakan jenis mineral yang tidak
dapat diperbaharui dimasa mendatang (Van
Nijen, 2019). Dengan demikian,
pemanfaatan yang berlebih aka n
menimbulkan pasokannya yang semakin
menipis pula.

Dengan adanya kontrak 31 eksplorasi saat
ini, menandakan bahwa negara -negara di
dunia seakan sudah mulai berlomba untuk
memanfaatkan sumber daya yang ada di
Area (ISA, 2021). Indonesia yang hingga
saat ini bahkan belum memiliki instrumen
domestik, seharusnya mulai
mempertimbangkan percepatan regulasi
mengenai hal tersebut. Pertimbangan
bahwa sumber daya alam yan ada
merupakan sumber daya alam yang tidak
dapat di perbaharui, kendatipun nantinya
akan ada mekanisme equity benefit sharing,
namun pada akhirnya hanya negara -negara
yang secara aktif mengelola Area sesegera
mungkinlah yang diuntungkan dengan rezim
hukum yang demikian ini.

2. Rekomentasi Arah Pengaturan
Seabed Mineral Act
Dalam perkembangannya, Indonesia
melalui Kementerian Koordinasi berencana
untuk menerbitkan pengaturan mengenai
penambangan di Area (Sora Lokita, 2021).
Untuk mendukung rencana implementasi
tersebut, maka dalam penelitian ini akan
mencoba merumuskan rekome ndasi yang
bisa digunakan Indonesia dalam
pembentukan seabed mineral act
mendasarkan pada hukum internasional
dan praktik -praktik negara lain. Mengenai

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
74

cakupan pembahasan, isu yang dapat
dikembangkan dalam hal ini adalah 1)
seperti apa produk hukum yang se suai
dengan seabed mineral act dan 2) klausula
seperti apa yang akan di atur oleh Indonesia.
Mengenai bentuk seabed mineral act
mendatang, berdasarkan perkembangannya
Indonesia saat ini berdasarkan persyataan
dari Kemenkomarves bahwa Indonesia
akan menggun akan produk hukum
Peraturan Presiden. Hal tersebut didasari
pada beberapa pertimbangan yakni 1)
pembentukan Perpres merupakan langkah
awal dimana kedepannya diharapkan
menjadi trigger regulasi lain mengenai Area,
dan 2) pembentukan Perpres lebih mudah
dibandingkan dengan pembentukan
Undang-Undang (Sora Lokita, 2021).

Namun demikian, pembentukan seabed
mineral act melalui Pepres sejatinya
memiliki beberapa permasalahan. Pertama,
merujuk pada hierarki peraturan perundang-
undangan dalam Pasal 7 Undang -Undang
Nomor 12 tahun 2011 tentang
Pembentukan Peraturan Perundang -
Undangan (UU P3) dimana dijelaskan
bahwa hierarki peraturan perundang -
undangan di Indonesia meliputi: a.Undang -
Undang Dasar Negara Republik Indonesia
Tahun 1945; b. Ketetapan Majelis
Permusyawaratan Rakyat; c. Undang -
Undang (UU)/Peraturan Pemerintah
Pengganti Undang -Undang; d. Peraturan
Pemerintah (PP); e. Peraturan Presiden; f.
Peraturan Daerah Provinsi; dan g.
Peraturan Daerah Kabupaten/Kota. Dari
konstruksi tersebut menurut Bagir Manan
dapat di ilhami beberapa prinsip bahwa
peraturan perundang -undangan tingkat
lebih rendah harus bersumber atau memiliki
dasar hukum dari suatu peraturan
perundang-undangan tingkat lebih tinggi
(Bagir Manan, 2000). Lebih lanjut, terlihat
bahwa Perpres dalam hal i ni kedudukannya
adalah dibawah baik itu UU maupun PP.
Ketiadaan regulasi pada tingkat UU maupun
PP menjadikan implementasi Perpres
menjadi bermasalah mengingat tidak ada
dasar hukum yang kuat pada level baik UU
maupun PP. Kendatipun memang
dimungkinkan dal am hal ini Pembentukan
Peraturan Presiden untuk melaksanakan
penyelenggaran kekuasaan pemerintah
atau Perpres Mandiri, regulasi yang lebih
umum sudah selayaknya dibentuk
mengingat regulasi mengenai Area memiliki
klausula yang cukup komprehensif untuk
diatur.

Kedua, sebagaimana Pasal 15 UU P3,
hanya UU, Peraturan Daerah Provinsi, dan
Peraturan Daerah Kabupaten/Kota yang
dapat memuat ketentuan pidana. Dengan
demikian, dipilihnya Perpres tentu akan
membatasi ruang lingkup pengaturan dalam
seabed mineral act. Regulasi seperti yang
dipraktikkan di Kiribati misalnya yang dalam

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
75

hal ini memiliki pengaturan mengenai
offence menjadi tidak dapat terimplementasi
dengan dipilihnya Perpres. Dalam hal ini
dijelaskan bahwa "In respect of an offence
punishable by a fine onl y, if the court finds
that the offence was committed by that
person wlffully, recklessly, corruplly or for
the purpose of personal gain, that person is
liable to imprisonment for a period of up to 7
years."

Namun demikian, dengan pertimbangan
percepatan pengelolaan Area, Perpres yang
akan diterbitkan seyogyanya mencukupi
dalam hal ini diharapkan kedepannya akan
memancing stakeholders lain untuk
kemudina membuat produk perundangan
mengenao Area secara lebih komprehensif.
Langkah awal pembentukan Perpres jug a
dirasa mencukupi sebagai trigger baik oleh
regulator maupun kepada masyarakat
Indonesia adar kemudian menyadari
pentingnya peran aktif Indonesia di Area.

Selanjutnya, mengenai klausula yang
sekiranya diatur dalam seabed mineral act
sendiri dapat meruju k pada beberapa
pertimbangan. Sebagaimana dijelaskan
sebelumnya bahwa pengaturan dalam
hukum internasional sejatinya
memembeaskan negara untuk mengatur
seperti apa seabed mineral act asalkan
sesuai dengan hukum internasional. Namun
demikian, berdasarkan ka jian ISA yakni
"Comparative Study of the Existing National
Legislation on Deep Seabed Mining " dan
juga guideline-guidline yang diterbitkan oleh
ISA dapat di rumuskan common element
dalam pembentukan seabed mineral act .
Klausula-klausula tersebut meliputi ( ISA,
2021):

a) Purposes and objectives
b) General principles
c) National competent authorities
d) Requirements for prospecting
e) Licencing regime for activities in the
Area
f) Rights, obligations and
responsibility/liability of a
licensee/sponsored party/contractor
g) Role and responsibilities of the
sponsoring State
h) Monitoring, supervision and
inspection
i) Marine environmental protection
j) Data and information
k) Financial arrangements
l) Offences and penalties
m) Due regard to other users of the
marine environment
n) Objects of an archaeological or
historical nature
o) Rights of other States
p) Dispute settlement
q) Terms and interpretation
r) Implementing regulations and
guidelines
s) Cooperation mechanisms with the
Authority

Dari 19 common element  pengaturan
seabed mineral act tersebut, dalam
penelitian ini penulis tidak akan
menguraikan permasing -masing melainkan
akan menjeleaskan 4 (empat) kaidah
penting meliputi peran partisipasi negara,

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
76

kelembagaan, mekanisme penerbitan
sponsor, alih teknologi dan ilmu
pengetahuan, dan lain-lain.

Peran Partisipasi Negara
Dalam UNCLOS 1982, mengenai peran
partisipasi negara di Area terdiri dari 3 (tiga)
yakni terkait dengan peran negara sebagai
anggota ISA, peran aktif dalam
penambangan, dan riset ilmiah kelautan.
Mengenai peran negara sebagai anggota
ISA dalam hal ini lebih kepada penekanan
kewenangan khususnya dalam hal negara
sebagai assembly dan council.
Kewenangan sebagai pembentuk regulasi
teknis hingga persetujuan rencana produksi
suatu kontraktor menjadi perhatian
tersendiri walaupun da lam seabed mineral
act nantinya peran tersebut tidak perlu
diatur secara rinci dikarenakan peran
pertama demikian akan lebih berfokus pada
kerangka domestik dan bukan politik
diplomasi internasional.

Peran kedua adalah aktif dalam
penambangan Area atau sebagai kontraktor.
Pasal 153 UNCLOS 1982 dapat dianalisis
mengenai 3 (tiga) pihak yang kemudian
dapat dimaknai terlibat langsung dalam
kegiatan di Area yang dalam hal ini penulis
mengkategorisasikannya menggunakan
pendekatan demikian yakni: the Enterprise,
State Direcly , dan Sponsored Entities.
Mengenai Peran serta negara secara
langsung atau State sederhananya adalah
negara secara langsung juga dapat menjadi
pihak dalam pengelolaan Area. Contoh
demikian dapat ditemukan dalam kontrak
eksplorasi dengan ISA dengan Korea, India,
Rusia, dan Polandia. Lebih lanjut, dalam
mekanisme sponsor entities negara dalam
hal ini adalah sebagai pihak yang akan
menerbitkan certificate of sponsorship yang
merupakan salah satu syarat apabila pihak
swasta ingin memanfaatkannya.

Dan peran ketiga adalah berkaitan dengan
riset ilmiah kelautan ( marine scientific
research). Kendatipun sebagaimana Article
143 UNCLOS 1982 peran demikian adalah
"hak" suatu negara, namun demi
mendukung adanya kajian yang mendalam
baik dilakukan oleh pe merintah maupun
pihak swasta mengenai sumber daya
mineral di Area demi percepatan partisipasi
Indonesia, maka sudah selayaknya
Indonesia bisa kemudian memanfaatkan
hak tersebut dengan optimal dengan
dukungan regulasi yang ada kedepannya.
Beberapa negara yang fokus mengatur riset
ilmiah kelautan mengenai Area adalah
Tonga, Nauru, dan Kiribati. Kepastian
hukum demikian juga akan memberikan
kemudahan bagi pihak -pihak yang secara
prosedural ingin melaksanakan riset ilmiah
kelautan mengenai Area. Dengan demikian,
maka sudah selayaknya dalam regulasi

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
77

kedepan Indonesia, ketiga peran diatas
dijadikan pertimbangan agar kemudian
terjadi peran yang komprehensif yang
diharapkan memang akan memberikan
percepatan partisipasi Indonesia dalam
pemanfaatan Area.

National Competent Authorities/
Kelembagaan
National competent authority  disebut juga
lembaga nasional yang berwenang
mengenai kegiatan di Area. Dalam hal ini
terdapat penyebutan lain yang sejatinya
lebih universal yakni National Authority yang
dipakai secara umum untuk menyebut
lembaga tersebut sepertihalnya yang
dilakukan oleh negara -negara yang
meletakkan fungsi kelembagaan tersebut
dalam kementerian dalam negeri eksisting
seperti halnya China, Belgia, Ceko, Jerman,
Jepang, dan UK (Chelsea Zhaoxi, 2020).
Namun de mikian, praktik lain negara yang
memiliki lembaga nasional sering kali
menyebut sebagai Seabed Mineral Authority
seperti halnya Nauru, Tonga, Cook Island,
dan Kiribati. Fungsi utama dari National
Authority yang harus dijamin dalam seabed
mineral act adalah memastikan tanggung
jawab negara khususnya dalam
pengelolaan Area yang dalam hal ini
dikelola oleh negara itu sendiri atau
menggunakan mekanisme sponsor. Hal ini
sebagaimana diatur dalam Pasal 153,
paragraf 4, UNCLOS 1982 menyatakan
bahwa kewajiban negara  sesuai dengan
pasal 139 Konvensi mensyaratkan
“mengambil semua tindakan yang
diperlukan untuk memastikan” kepatuhan
oleh kontraktor yang disponsori.

Adapun dalam hal pengaturan di Indonesia,
sebagaimana penjelasan oleh pihak
Kemenkomarves berdasarkan has il
wawancara penulis adalah nantinya akan
meletakkan fungsi national authority  ini
kepada kementerian eksisting dengan tidak
membentuk lembaga khusus yang
menangani Area. Dengan demikian, dapat
kemudian diatur dalam seabed mineral act
Indonesia kedepan mengenai wewenang
apa saja dan bagaimana mekanisme kerja
sama antar lembaga eksisting yang ada
tersebut khususnya dalam hal penerbitan
izin bagi kontraktor dan mekanisme
pengawasan.

Dalam wawancara tersebut juga dijelaskan
bahwa pengaturan mengenai kelemb agaan
akan di fokuskan pada pemberian
wewenang aktif kepada Kementerian Energi
dan Sumber Daya Mineral (Kemen ESDM)
yang akan memiliki kewenangan untuk
menerbitkan certificate of sponsorship  yang
dalam hal ini merupakan peran utama dari
national authority (Kemenkomarves, 2021) .
Namun demikian unsur kementerian lain
juga tetap akan diberikan kewenangan
khususnya terkait dengan mekanisme check

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
78

and ballance dimana dalam Perpres
eksisting akan diatur mengenai kewenagan
Menteri ESDM untuk memberikan
penugasan ke pada kementerian lain
misalnya untuk mekanisme peninjauan
Analisis Dampak Lingkungan (AMDAL)
kementerian ESDM akan bekerja sama
dengan Kementerian Lingkungan Hidup dan
Kehutanan (KLHK) sedangkan untuk urusan
geospatial akan bekerja sama dengan
Badan Inform asi Geospasial (BIG). Lebih
lanjut, rancangan Perpres tersebut juga
akan membentuk sebuah tim koordinasi
antar kementerian dengan Kemenkomarves
yang akan menjadi leading sector untuk
membahas isu strategis mengenai peran
aktif Indonesia di Area. Selain dal am hal
perizinan, unsur kelembagaan dalam
rancangan Perpres juga akan membahas
mengenai percepatan riset ilmiah kelautan
dimana hal tersebut diharapkan akan
banyak kajian mengenai Area untuk
Indonesia dimana dalam hal ini Badan Riset
dan Inovasi Nasional R epublik Indonesia
(BRIN) akan menjadi leading sector dalam
hal riset ilmiah kelautan tersebut
(Kemenkomarves, 2021, wawancara).

Meninjau rancangan Perpres tersebut,
adapun catatan yang penulis sampaikan
meliputi 2 (dua) catatan meliputi:
Pertama, Simpli fikasi Birokasi. Tujuan
utama adanya seabed mineral act adalah
tentunya meningkatkan partisipasi negara
baik itu dilakukan oleh negara melalui
kementerian atau pun pihak swasta dalam
pemanfaatan Area. Maka dari itu, birokrasi
yang sederhana dan cepat sudah
selayaknya dimiliki mengingat apabila
meninjau dalam rezim birokrasi perizinan
pertambangan yang ada. Perlu
dipertimbangkan untuk membentuk tim
koordinasi antar kementerian agar
memudahkan kerjasama  baik penerbitan
izin maupun pembahasan isu -isu strategis
mengenai Area. Praktik pembentukan tim
koordinasi sejatinya belum pernah
dilakukan oleh negara -negara di dunia
dalam hal pemanfaatan Area. Namun
demikian, dengan adanya Kemenkomarves
sebagai Kemente rian Koordinasi, sudah
selayaknya pembentukan tim tersebut
bukan suatu halangan dimana pada
akhirnya Kemenkomarves yang kemudian
menjadi ketua pengarah tim sersebut.
Kedua, Pergeseran Paradigma
Keterwakilan ISA oleh Kementerian Luar
Negeri. Pada awal pemb entukan rezim
hukum Area, keterwakilan lembaga nasional
bercorak diplomatis tentu menjadi penting
khususnya dalam peletakan asas -asas
umum dalam pemanfaatan Area. Hal ini
dapat dilihat dari komposisi keterwakilan
negara dalam pembentukan UNCLOS 1982
yang m ayoritas tentu adalah Kementerian
Luar Negeri. Namun demikian, dengan

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
79

rezim hukum pembahasan yang mulai
mengarah kepada teknis pertambangan
seperti halnya draft exploitation yang
memiliki klausula mengenai royalti, best
environmental pratices, hingga perat uran
teknis mengenai mining, sudah selayaknya
untuk kemudian mempertimbangkan
keterwakilan kementerian lain di dalam
perwakilan Indonesia terhadap ISA.
Kementerian dengan Kapasitas terkait
mining ataupun memiliki cakupan
pengetahuan juga terkait dengan inv estasi
dan ekonomi haruslah di pertimbangkan
untuk menggantikan Kemenlu dalam
pembahasannya terkait draft exploitation
maupun regulations di ISA kedepannya.
Mekanisme Penerbitan sponsor
Penerbitan sponsor merupakan
mekanisme dukungan negara terhadap
kontraktor yang akan melakukan
penambangan di Area sebagaimana
Article 4 (3) Annex III UNCLOS 1982
"Each applicant shall be sponsored by
the State Party of which it is a national".
Dalam penerbitan sponsor tersebut
maka negara yang menerbitkan
dianggap sebagai negara yang
bertanggung jawab melalui hukum
domestiknya untuk membantu ISA
dalam mengawasi kegiatan kontraktor di
Area. Dalam mengatur terkait
penerbitan sponor, perlu diperha tikan
beberapa konsep dasar yang berkaitan
dengan rezim hukum Area yang dalam
hal ini terdiri dari:
1)  Pembedaan tahapan Prospecting,
Exploration, dan Exploitation
Dalam proses pertambangan di Area,
baik UNCLOS 1982, dan peraturan
turunannya memberikan pe mbagian
tahapannya dalam hal Prospecting,
Exploration, dan Exploitation.
Prospecting sendiri merupakan
tahapan " the search for deposits of
polymetallic nodules (mineral) in the
Area, including estimation of the
composition, sizes and distributions of
deposits of polymetallic nodules and
their economic values, without any
exclusive rights ". Dari pengertian
tersebut dapat dilihat bahwa tahap
prospecting sendiri esensinya
merupakan tahap pencarian mineral
yang belum terfokus pada suatu Area
(cakupan Area masih cukup luas)
dimana tahapan tersebut meliputi
perkiraan komposisi, ukuran dan
distribusi endapan nodul polimetalik
(nodule polymetalic/ mineral) dan nilai
ekonominya, tanpa hak eksklusif apa
pun. Hak ekslusif dalam Article 16
Annex III UNCLOS 1982 sendiri dapat
dimaknai bahwa:
 “...accord the operator the
exclusive right to explore and
exploit the Area covered by the

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
80

plan of work in respect of a
specified category of resources
and shall ensure that no other
entity operates in the same Area
for a differe nt category of
resources in a manner which
might interfere with the
operations of the operator...".
Tahap selanjutnya adalah Exploration.
Dalam Mining Code, Exploration
didefnisikan sebagai:
"the searching for deposits of
polymetallic nodules in the Area
with exclusive rights, the
analysis of such deposits, the
use and testing of recovery
systems and equipment,
processing facilities and
transportation systems and the
carrying out of studies of  the
environmental, technical,
economic, commercial and other
appropriate factors that must be
taken into account in
exploitation"
Dari pengertian tersebut, terlihat
bahwa tahap exploration sejatinya
justru merupakan tahap awal
dimulainya mekanisme perta mbangan
dimana mengenai kegiatannya akan
lebih berfokus pada satu Area
exploration. Mengenai kegiatan apa
saja yang dapat dilakukan dapat
dilihat bahwa akan terdiri dari
pencarian endapan nodul polimetalik
(mineral) di Area namun berbeda
dengan tahap Prospecting, tahapan
ini sudah terdapat hak eksklusif bagi
kontraktor. Kegiatan lainnya adalah
analisis endapan tersebut,
penggunaan dan pengujian sistem
dan peralatan pemulihan, fasilitas
pemrosesan dan sistem transportasi
dan pelaksanaan studi lingkungan,
teknis, ekonomi, komersial dan faktor -
faktor lain yang sesuai yang harus
diperhitungkan dalam eksploitasi.
Tahap terakhir adalah Exploitation.
Exploitation sendiri dimaknai sebagai:
"...the recovery for commercial
purposes of polymetallic nodules in
the Area and the extraction of
minerals therefrom, including the
construction and operation of mining,
processing and transportation
systems, for the production and
marketing of metals.. .". Merupakan
tahapan terakhir dimana dalam hal ini
akan berfokus pada ekstraks i mineral
di Area.
Dengan demikian, jelas bahwa ketiga
tahapan tersebut haruslah diatur
dalam seabed mineral act agar
kemudian memberikan kepastian
hukum cakupan dan pembedaan
kegiatan pada masing -masing izin
nantinya. Lebih lanjut, pembedaan ini
juga menj adi penting mengingat
dalam rezim izin, kegiatan prospecting
sendiri berbeda dengan exploration
dan exploitation dimana tahapan
exploration dan exploitation haruslah
menggunakan skema certificate of
sponsorship yang di terbitkan oleh
nagara yang kemudian harus
diberikan approval oleh ISA,
sedangkan untuk tahapan prospecting

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
81

sendiri tidak diharuskan mengajukan
izin kepada negara melainkan hanya
menggunakan mekanisme izin kepada
ISA yakni berupa " satisfactory written
undertaking" dimana diharapkan
prospector akan mematuhi hukum
internasional terkait dengan Area
sebagaimana Article 2 (1) (b) Annex
III UNCLOS 1982. Namun demikian,
dalam hal ini penulis mengusulkan
bahwa walaupun memang tidak
diwajibkan, namun pemerint ah
Indonesia bisa mengatur dalam
seabed mineral act bahwa bagi
kontraktor yang berasal dari Indonesia,
haruslah memberikan notification
kepada Indonesia. Hal ini demi
menjamin kebutuhan pendataan
sekaligus perluasan kontrol efektif
pihak yang berasal dari Indonesia
agar kemudian melaksanakan
kegiatan prospecting sebagaimana
hukum internasional. Pengaturan
demikian dapat ditemukan dalam
praktik negara Kiribati dimana Kiribati
memberlakukan " Prospecting Permits
within Kiribati's National Jurisdicition "
untuk menjamin pemenuhan
kewajiban bagi kontraktor yang
berasal dari negaranya.
Isu lain terkait dengan tahapan
penambangan tersebut adalah
haruslah diberikan sosialisasi bahwa
pemberian baik permits mengenai
prospecting maupun certificate of
sponsorship, bukanl ah suatu jaminan
kontraktor yang merupakan kontrol
efektif Indonesia akan dapat
melaksanakan kegiatan
pertambangan di Area yang di
tentukan sebelumnya menggunakan
mekanisme hukum domestik
Indonesia. Keputusan pemberian
grant tersebut tetaplah kepada ISA
yang dalam hal ini memang posisi
negara adalah sebagai supporting dan
penanggung dari pada kewajiban
internasional yang diatur dalam
konvensi. Selain itu, pemberian
certificate of sponsorship  haruslah
spesifik dan tidak menjadi satu
kesatuan antara kegiatan exploration
dan exploitation. Dengan demikian,
pengajuan izin bisa saja berbeda.
Untuk kemudian menghindari
ketidakpastian hukum bagi kontraktor,
Pemerintah Indonesia dapat
kemudian mengatur bahwa pemohon
exploration sebelumnya dalam Area
penambangan yang sama, akan
diberikan pengutamaan dalam
pemberian izin exploitation.
Pemberian jaminan keberlanjutan
(sustainability) ini akan
menghindarkan pula dari kesewenang
wenangan negara dalam memberikan
izin terkait kegiatan di Area.

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
82

Relevan pula terkait dengan
serangkaian proses ini adalah
berkaitan dengan pengambilan
keputusan untuk penerbitan izinnya.
Hal ini tentu akan sangat berpengaruh
dari bagaimana bentuk national
authority suatu negara. Namun yang
perlu dipastikan adalah bahwa
pengambilan keputusan dalam
kegiatan di Area ini haruslah
menerapkan prinsip check and
ballance serta dilakukan dalam proses
yang cepat sehingga akan menarik
banyak pihak khususnya apabila
suatu negara ingin menggalang dana
melalui skema permodalan oleh
investor.
2.     Kewarganegaraan Kontraktor
Kewarganegaraan negaraan
kontraktor merupakan salah satu isu
yang penting khususnya dalam
pengaturan mengenai seabed mineral
act. Dalam hal cakupan pembaha san,
isu kewarganegaraan sendiri
merupakan cakupan dalam
pembahasan terkait eligibility dari
seorang kontraktor yang mengajukan
sponsor kepada suatu negara. Dalam
regulasinya sendiri, kewajiban
nationality tersebut diatur dalam
Article 4 (1) Annex III UNCL OS 1982
yang mengatur bahwa kontraktor
(applicant) " shall be qualified if they
have the nationality or control and
sponsorship required by article 153,
paragraph 2(b)... ". Isu ini menjadi
penting mengingat bagaimana
intepretasi dari kewarganegaraan itu
sendiri, apakah kontraktor haruslah
dari negara yang bersangkutan dan
apakah di mungkinkan untuk
kontraktor asing yang kemudian
mengajukan certificate of sponsorship
di Indonesia. Pada praktiknya,
beberapa mengharuskan kontraktor
yang bersangkutan haruslah
merupakan warga negaranya atau
badan hukum yang berdiri atau
berkegiatan di bawah hukum negara
bersangkutan. Singapura misalnya
mengharuskan kontraktor yang
merupakan entitas " Singapore
National" atau dalam hal ini
merupakan (a) " a Singapore Citizen";
atau ( b) " an entity incorporared,
formed or established in Singapore
under any written law ". Pengaturan
yang sedikit berbeda dilakukan oleh
Nauru, Tonga, dan Kiribati dimana
dalam seabed mineral act hanya
mensyaratkan " is an existing body
corporated, registered in
Nauru/Tonga/Kiribati.
Dari pengaturan negara -negara
tersebut, jelas bahwa persyaratan
utama bagi pihak sponsor memang

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
83

haruslah merupakan personalia dari
suatu negara, sehingga badan hukum
asing yang ingin mendaftar untuk
mendapatkan certificate of
sponsorship haruslah terlebih dahulu
"mendirikan" entitas perwakilannya
maupun menggunakan mekanisme
pengendalian efektif terhadap badan
hukum suatu negara tersebut. Praktik
demikian dapat dilihat daripada yang
dilakukan oleh Nautilus Minera l Inc.
Nauru sebagaimana perjanjian
dengan ISA poin 2 dengan jelas
menjelaskan bahwa Nauru Ocean
Resources Inc dalam hal ini kemudian
merupakan subsidiary dari Nautilus
Minerals Inc. yang merupakan
perusahaan dari Kanada. Sama
halnya dengan Nauru dimana To nga
sendiri menggunakan Tonga Offshore
Mining Limited dalam hal ini sebagai
subsidari dari Nautilus inc.
"Nauru Ocean Resources is a
Nauruan incorporated subsidiary
of Nautilus Minerals Inc.
(“Nautilus”), which is the world
leader in the commercial
exploration and sustainable
development of deep-sea
mineral resources. Nautilus has
among its largest shareholders
two of the world’s leading
international resource
companies, Teck Cominco and
Anglo American, and is the only
company in the world that has
been ab le to successfully
explore for polymetallic
sulphides, sample, drill and trial
mine in water depths greater
than 1,500 m."
Dari praktik tersebut jelas bahwa
kemudian suatu negara yang ingin
mengajukan certificate of sponsorship
haruslah mendirikan subsidary organ
yang merupakan badan hukum dari
negara bersangkutan dalam hal
Indonesia maka harus mendirikan
badan hukum di Indonesia. Walaupun
praktik tersebut berbeda dengan
Kiribati dimana dalam pengelolaannya
menggunakan Marawa Research and
Exploration Ltd, (Marawa) yang dalam
hal ini merupakan Badan Usaha Milik
Negara (BUMN) dari Kiribati itu sendiri
pun dengan Singapura yang tidak ada
klausula "pengendalian efektif"
tersebut oleh entitas negara lain.
Namun demikian, rasio dari praktik
yang demikian tentunya sama yakni
demi melaksanakan pengenadlian
efektif suatu hukum kepada
perusahaan yang bersangkutan.
Dalam hal ini maka tidak
dimungkinkan untuk badan usaha
asing yang kemudian secara
"langsung" mengajukan certificate of
sponsorship kepada suatu negara
yang bukan domisilinya.
Konsep pengendalian efektif entitas
asing tersebut diafirmasi pula dalam
the mining code dimana diatur bahwa

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
84

"where an applicant has the
nationality of one State but is
effectively controlled by another State
or its nationals, each State  shall issue
a certificate of sponsorship ". Dengan
demikian jelas bahwa kendatipun
menggunakan mekanisme kontrol dari
negara asing, dalam contoh Nautilus
Mineral Inc. perusahaan yang
berdomisili di Kanada tersebut secara
tidak langsung juga harus meminta
certificate of sponsorship kepada
Pemerintah Kanada. Dengan
demikian, jelas bahwa kemudian
memamng baik antara negara asal
badan usaha asing dan juga negara
tempat penerbitan certificate of
sponsorship akan memiliki sharing
baik itu responsibility dan juga liability
jika terjadi damage pada kegiatan di
Area yang dilakukan oleh kontraktor
yang di sponsorinya.
3.      Perjanjian, Pengalihan,
Pencabutan, Penangguhan, dan
Pembaharuan Sertifikat Sponsor
Bagian pengaturan ini berkaitan
dengan bagaimana skema perja njian
khususnya antara negara dengan
kontraktor yang di sponsorinya.
Beberapa negara seperti Tonga,
Nauru, Kiribati, mengatur
kemungkinkan pengalihan sertifikat
sponsor itu sendiri agar memudahkan
operasional bagi kontraktor.
Ketentuan mengenai penangguhan
dan pencabutan juga menjadi penting
agar kontraktor mengetahui
konsekuensi apabila bertindak tidak
sesuai dengan hukum internasional
dan hukum domestik, sekaligus wujud
pengendalian efektif bagi Pemerintah
dalam kegiatan di Area.
Kemungkinkan Alih Teknologi dan
Pengetahuan Ilmiah
Meskipun UNCLOS tidak mendefinisikan
“Alih Teknologi”, Part XIV UCNLOS
menyiratkan makna yang luas dan
hubungan yang erat dengan ilmu kelautan.
Misalnya Pasal 266(1) menyatakan bahwa
“States, directly or through competent
international organizations, shall cooperate
in accordance with their capabilities to
promote actively the development and
transfer of marine science and marine
technology on fair and reasonable terms
and conditions ”. Kendatipun memang, Part
XIV menetapkan  kerangka kerja di mana
pengembangan dan transfer teknologi
kelautan berjalan seiring dengan penelitian
ilmiah kelautan (Long, 2007). Kata “transfer”
hanya muncul satu kali dalam Pasal 268
UNCLOS 1982, yang dalam hal ini dapat
kemudian dipetakan menjadi (H arriet,
2020;4):

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
85

1) Data, informasi dan pengetahuan:
berbagi data, informasi, dan
pengetahuan tentang kegiatan dan
keluaran penelitian ilmiah kelautan,
serta perkembangan teknologi.
2) Masyarakat: pelatihan ilmu
pengetahuan dan teknologi dan
pertukaran orang-orang yang terampil;
3) Peralatan: akses ke atau transfer
infrastruktur dan peralatan penelitian,
termasuk perangkat keras dan
perangkat lunak; dan
4) Kerjasama dan kolaborasi: untuk
penelitian ilmiah (termasuk kriteria
dan standar, program, pendanaan
untuk ilmu kelautan), melalui kegiatan,
program termasuk lembaga ilmiah
dan teknis internasional, regional
dan/atau nasional.
Namun demikian, konsep alih teknologi
secara umum dalam Part XIV UNCLOS
1982, nyatanya ditemukan sedikit
perbedaan khususnya dalam pengaturan d i
Area. Dalam ketentuan mengenai Area,
konsep dasar Alih Teknologi diatur dalam
Article 144 dan Article 5 Annex III UNCLOS
1982. Ide awalnya adalah bahwa ISA dan
Negara Bekembang dalam hal ini boleh
untuk mengakuisisi baik itu teknologi dan
juga pengetahua n ilmiah terkait dengan
pertambangan di Area kepada kontraktor.
Artinya bahwa cakupan mengenai teknologi
dalam hal ini bisa saja merupakan teknologi
yang digunakan oleh negara dalam konteks
Area ataupun juga teknologi yang
digunakan oleh kontraktor di Area
mengingat memang subjek penambangan
di Area tercakup dari 3 (tiga) dimana dua
diantaranya adalah negara secara langsung
ataupun perusahaan swasta.
Praktik yang demikian mendapatkan
penolakan dari berbagai negara karena
beberapa alasan: Pertama, dalam kont eks
“alih teknologi”, baik dalam judul Part XIV
atau Article 144, ada dua unsur esensial:
“transfer teknologi” dan “transfer
pengetahuan ilmiah”. Dengan kata lain, alih
teknologi dalam arti luas tidak hanya
mencakup alih teknologi itu sendiri, tetapi
juga alih pengetahuan ilmiah yang berkaitan
dengan teknologi.
Lebih lanjut, ISA dan negara berkembang
akan mendapatkan akses ke teknologi
penambangan Area dan keahlian teknis
yang diperlukan untuk memanfaatkan
teknologi itu secara efektif. Hal tersebut
tentu a kan sangat memberatkan bagi
kontraktor jika memang kemudian ISA
memiliki akses sedemikian rupa. Lebih
lanjut, ruang lingkup “teknologi” dianggap
terlalu luas dan multitafsir sehingga rawan
untuk di salah gunakan (Ning Y, 2021). dan
Kedua, ketentuan bahwa k ontraktor (dalam
konteks swasta) akan tunduk pada
persyaratan wajib untuk transfer teknologi
kepada the Enterprsie (ISA) dan negara

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
86

berkembang dianggap memberatkan,
merugikan hak kekayaan intelektual.
Dengan alasan tersebutlah penentangan
terhadap transfer  teknologi yang bersifat
wajib ini muncul dari negara -negara industri
besar seperti Italia, Amerika Serikat, dan
Inggris. Atas dasar permasalahan tersebut,
maka dalam  Section 5 the Implementing
Agreement 1994 akhirnya membatalkan
peraturan wajib terkait al ih teknologi
terhadap ISA (Nelson, 1995).
Adapun konteks dari penghapusan
ketentuan tersebut dengan pembentukan
seabed mineral act adalah bahwa dalam hal
ini kontraktor khususnya dari negara maju
akan sangat menentang terkait pengaturan
alih teknologi dan  pengetahuan ilmiah
dalam seabed mineral act suatu negara.
Indonesia dalam hal ini harus sangat hati -
hati merumuskannya mengingat agar
kemudian banyak negara yang tidak
merasa terbebani atas aturan demikian.
Melihat praktik negara -negara di dunia pun
pada dasarnya juga sangat jarang yang
mengatur klasula terkait alih teknologi.
Adapun negara lebih menekankan pada
kewajiban agar setidaknya terdapat
pelatihan yang nantinya di lakukan antara
negara tersebut bekerjasama dengan
kontraktor sebagaimana Article 39 (g)
Klausula alih teknologi dalam Tonga
Seabed Mineral Act.
"cooperate in capacity -building of
personnel of the Kingdom in
connection with Marine Scientific
Research, Seabed Mineral Activities,
and related transfer of technology,
including providing opport unities in
consultation with the Authority for the
participation of representatives of the
Kingdom in the Seabed Mineral
Activities"
Namun demikian, dalam hal ini apabila
memang dirasa perlu, Penulis sendiri akan
lebih menyarankan agar kemudian tidak
mengatur mengenai klausula alih teknologi
dan ilmu pengetahuan namun justru
memasukan pembahasan tersebut dalam
kontrak-kontrak khusus yang nantinya harus
dilakukan dalam hal ini oleh perusahaan
asing yang mau mendirikan perusahaan
subsidary di Indonesia dan ma u
menggunakan Indonesia sebagai penerbit
sponsor.
Lain-lain
Sebagaimana common element pengaturan
seabed mineral act , bahwa memang
praktiknya akan banyak klausula yang
harus diatur. Klausula penting lain misalnya
terkait dengan finansial. Isu tersebut baik
dalam UNCLOS 1982 samapi dengan
aturan turunannya, tidak ada yang
mengatur bagaimana suatu negara harus
memberlakukan aturan finansial bagi
kontraktor yang di sponsorinya. Dengan
demikian, hal ini dikembalikan lagi kepada
bagaimana masing -masing negara. Tonga
dan Nauru misalnya, mereka lebih memilih

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
87

untuk tidak memasukkan klausul tersebut
dalam seabed mineral act. Berbeda dengan
Kiribati yang kemudian memasukannya
agar kemudian lebih menjamin kepastian
hukumnya. Namun demikian, konsepnya
adalah bahwa terkait pengaturan finansial
memang badan hukum tunduk kemudian
pada aturan finansial mulai dari perpajakan
hingga dirasa  perlu annual fee yang di
syaratkan suatu negara. Begitupula
klausula penting lain seperti, penyelesaian
sengketa, kewajiban pengelolaan
lingkungan yang baik, dsb. haruslah
kemudian mengacu pada hukum
internasional, dan bagaimana kepentingan
Indonesia sendiri kedepannya.
Namun yang jelas bahwa dalam
pengaturan kedepan, Indonesia sudah
selayaknya tidak hanya berfokus terkait
bagaimana penerbitan sponsor itu sendiri
melainkan harus melihat mulai dari
tahapan proses baik sebelum penerbitan
berkaitan dengan riset ilmiah kelautan dan
prospecting, penerbitan bekaitan dengan
sponsor itu sendiri dan serangkaian
dokumen yang diperlukan, dan yang tidak
kalah penting adalah kegiatan pasca
penerbitan dimana Indonesia di tuntut
untuk tetap melaksanakan kontrol efektif
kepada kontraktor yang di sponsorinya
KESIMPULAN DAN REKOMENDASI
Dari kajian tersebut dapat disimpulkan
bahwa Indonesia perlu mengatur mengenai
seabed mineral act meliputi beberapa
pertimbangan diantaranya  yakni menjamin
kepastian hukum kegiatan di Area yang
dilakukan oleh entitas sponsor yang di
sponsori Indonesia, merupakan wujud
implementasi kewajiban due dilligence dari
Annex III Article 4 UNCLOS 1982,
merupakan wujud komitmen Indonesia
dalam implementasi ketentuan UNCLOS
1982 dan Implementing Agreement  1994.
Keutungan lain apabila menimbang posisi
Indonesi adalah bahwa posisi indonesia
seabagi negara berkembang yang tentunya
akan mendapatkan afirmasi dari prinsip
CHM, politik luar negeri Indonesia sebagai
poros maritim dunia, dan terakhir adalah
sumber daya alam di Area merupakan non-
renewable resources . Adapun mengenai
bagaimana arah implementasi seabed
mineral act Indonesia mendatang tentunya
sangat baik apabila dimulai dengan
pembentukan Perpres terlebih dahulu
sebagai pemantik partisipasi Indonesia d an
apabila dirasa perlu beberapa
penyempurnaan khususnya berkaitan
dengan sanksi maka kedepannya perlu
dipertimbangkan pembentukan UU.
Mengenai klausula yang dalam hal ini
perlu mendapatkan perhatian oleh
Indonesia dalam hal ini meliputi peran

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
88

partisipasi negara, kelembagaan,
mekanisme penerbitan sponsor, alih
teknologi dan ilmu pengetahuan, finansial,
aspek pengelolaan lingkungan,
penyelesaian sengketa dan klausula lain
yang sekiranya perlu dalam mendukung
percepatan partisipasi Indonesia di Area.

SHIFTING THE PERSPECTIVE OF CITIZENS PROTECTION
FROM A CONSULAR TO A FOREIGN POLICY:
The Indonesia Experience

Mohamad Nurdin
Directorate of Protection of Citizens Overseas, MoFA of Indonesia


Abstract
Consular relations are still less covered in the international  relations literature, it can be understood that
the political perspective has high appeal in the academic discussion of international relations. However,
consular relations, both historically and in contemporary terms, still have high relevance in modern
international relations discourse, especially in terms of the involvement of countries that have a high
number of labor-supply abroad in multi -dimensional dynamics in various international fora. The relevance
covers various aspects of employment, immigrati on, consular affairs, and the protection of workers
abroad in general.
International relations in general are still minimally capturing the consular relations as an entry point for
the protection of citizens abroad. The experience of Indonesia's siding wit h the protection of Indonesian
citizens in international relations has opened its own interesting perspective, considering that in efforts to
protect Indonesian citizens, Indonesia not only views it as an avenue of consular relations but also shifts it
as a foreign policy that becomes a national priority. This paper seeks to investigate aspects of protecting
citizens abroad in the study of international relations in general and to describe Indonesia's experience
which presents a perspective on protecting ci tizens abroad which has shifted from consular efforts to
foreign policy
Keywords: consular, foreign policy, protection of citizens

INTRODUCTION
With the world becoming smaller for a
rapidly increasing number of people, and
travelers with an ever more varied
demographic, related consular issues are
gaining prominence on both international
and domestic agendas.

The globalization process and instability are
two ingredients of international relations that
make people travel overseas in increasingly
large numbers, and that may help get them
into trouble in foreign lands. Changing
patterns of international tourism, cross -
border crime, international terrorism, and
natural disasters account for a surge in
consular challenges.

With approximately 1.2 billion tourists and
230 million expatriates crossing borders
every day, questions about what kind of
responsibility states ha ve for citizens living
abroad are politically relevant  (Nina
Græger, 2019:4).

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
92

Indonesia as a labor -supplying state has a
great interest in protecting all Indonesian
citizens around the world. According to data
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(Directorate of Protection of Citizens
Overseas, 2021), there are currently more
than 3 million Indonesian citizens living
abroad. A significant portion of this number
comes from the number of Indonesian
citizens in many countries, with the largest
consecutive des tination countries being
Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, and Hong
Kong.

Referring to the records of the World Bank
(The World Bank, 2017:2), the number of
Indonesian migrant workers (Pekerja Migran
Indonesia/PMI) worldwide is estimated at
more than 9 million people, this figure is
equivalent to a total of 7 (seven) percent of
the total number of Indonesia's workforce.
The difference in PMI numbers is still
considered reasonable considering that
awareness of self -report for Indonesian
citizens/PMI is ge nerally still very low,
especially the challenges of collecting data
for Indonesian citizens/PMIs abroad, both in
terms of geography and access from
Indonesian citizens/PMI themselves to the
nearest Indonesian Representative, are still
experiencing various  kinds of problems.
resistance.

From this number of PMIs, still from the
World Bank's calculations based on a report
titled "Indonesia's Global Workers: Juggling
Opportunities and Risks" in 2017, it is stated
that the total economic contribution of PMI
remittances to the national economy
reached Rp. 118 trillion. Moreover, working
abroad has greatly improved PMI's standard
of living in terms of income, increased work
experience and abilities, reduced the
economic burden on families in Indonesia,
and other  benefits including contributing to
the improvement of education for their
children in Indonesia (40%), capital for
entrepreneurship at home (15%), and
recorded that more than 20% of income
came in the form of savings.

PMI's great contribution to the Indonesian
economy in general and the standard of
living of each PMI family in Indonesia is not
without blemish, Indonesia's experience in
receiving various PMI problems abroad has
triggered more comprehensive efforts to
prevent problems, deal with, and cr eate a
labor migration system/environment
procedural, legal, and safe for PMI or PMI
candidates. PMI problems include
immigration, employment, and even criminal
issues, both as perpetrators and victims
abroad.

integral part of diplomacy embedded in
foreign policy priorities and as a
constitutional mandate has given rise to a
relatively unique perspective in the study of
international relations. This paper intends to
explore such perspective starting from its
basis as a consular service to its both
paradigm and practices as one of national
foreign policy priorities.

FRAMEWORK
The framework of thought used in writing is
a literature study, namely collecting and
tracing legal regulations, books, related to
citizen protection, foreign policy issues and
consular service. Literature research
methodology is to read through, analyze
and sort literatures to identify the essential
attribute of materials. Its significant
difference from other methodologies is that
it does not directly deal with the object
under study, but to indirectly access to
information from a variety of literatures.

The author will offer the study's findings in
the form of a systematic, logical, and
rational summary in this study. In the sense
that the overall findings of the literature
review will be related to one another
according to the subject matter researched,
resulting in a coherent whole based on
applicable legal principles, doctrines, ideas,
and practices.
Since the literature reviewer choose from a
variety of techniques and processes for
locating, documenting, comprehending,
making sense of, and disseminating
material relevant to a topic of interest, the
literature review is referred to as a method .
Moreover, conducting a literature review is
equivalent to conducting a research study
(Onwuegbuzie, A.J., Leech, N.L. and
Collins, K.M., 2012: 56), with the information
that the literature reviewer collects
representing the data.

Among other methods, lite rature reviews
are essential for : Identifying what has been
written on a subject or topic; determining the
extent to which a specific research area
reveals any interpretable trends or patterns;
aggregating empirical findings related to a
narrow research qu estion to support
evidence-based practice; generating new
frameworks and theories; and identifying
topics or questions requiring further
investigation (Paré, Trudel, Jaana, &
Kitsiou, 2015: 185).

DISCUSSION
It is important for the Ministries of Foreign
Affairs (hereinafter MFAs) to create an in -
depth awareness among diplomatic
personnel of how consular matters connect
to priority concerns in foreign policy, and to
express such ties when appropriate. The

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
94

emphasis is on how consular issues are not
just tied to foreign policy but can also be
viewed as an important aspect of MFAs'
everyday diplomatic strategy.

It is important for MFAs to create an in -
depth awareness among diplomatic
personnel of how consular matters connect
to priority concerns in foreign policy, and to
express such ties when appropriate. The
emphasis is on how consular issues are not
just tied to foreign policy but can also be
viewed as an important aspect of MFAs'
everyday diplomatic strategy.

In this study, the analysis will be taken by
approaching the concept and practices of
citizen protection abroad in three parts.
First, the citizens protection in consular
perspective; second, the protection of
citizen in foreign policy perspective; and the
third, the protection of Indonesian citizen s
as an integral part of Indonesian diplomacy.

1. Revisiting Citizens Protection
Citizen protection conceptual basis are not
new, only recently has just been more
interest in revisiting the breadth and depth
of citizen protection in relation to new
dynamics after World War II of which
international relation has closer historical
strand to our current global landscape.
Academic endeavor has also recently put
more effort on understanding the extent of
the protection for citizen overseas especially
after the US  declared ‘the global war on
terrorism’.

Elihu Root (1910) on his piece titled “The
Basis of Protection to Citizens Residing
Abroad” revisit the concept of limitation of
protection for citizen abroad as stated:
He will naturally be, at a
disadvantage in l itigation against
citizens of the country. He is less
familiar than they with the laws, the
ways of doing business, the habits of
thought and action, the method of
procedure, the local customs and
prejudices, and often with the
language in which the busine ss is
done and the proceedings carried
on. It is not the duty of a foreign
country in which such a litigant finds
himself to make up to him for these
disadvantages under which he
labors. They are disadvantages
inseparable from his prosecuting his
business in a strange land.
Such limit of protection also recognized in
our law, as determined by Regulation of
Ministry of Foreign Affairs No. 5/2018 on
Protection of Indonesia Citizens Overseas
stated Article 2 (2) on principle of protection
of which emphasize th e importance of
government not taking over responsibilities
of individuals overseas be in criminal or
private.

However, as also regulated by Law No.
12/2006 on Citizenship of the Republic of
Indonesia, Indonesia has firmly adopted the
principle of maximum  protection. Such

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
95

promulgation enshrined by the Constitution
of the Republic of Indonesia on protecting
all Indonesia citizens. As also aligned with
the notion of n o breach of the law can
deprive a person in a foreign nation of the
right to protection from his own government.

There can be no crime that deprives a man
of his legal rights. One has the right to urge
that he be executed only in accordance with
the law, or without the hearing that the
internationally acknowledged norms of
justice require. If that right is denied , his
own government can and should defend
him. Such norm has also been developed
as customary in civilized nations.

Indonesian government has experienced
rapid development in the last ten years,
citizen protection has been set out as
strategic priority in the presidential
development agenda named Nawa Cita.
Indonesia MFA has also placed citizen
protection as central notion in foreign policy
of Indonesia. The citizen protection by
government that had been practiced on
incidental basis a re starting to be reformed
into system of citizen protection with proper
and improved data collection integrated with
immigration data and population and civil
registration data.

As for Indonesia experience in citizen
protection in the last decade, there are
several notable efforts. The Indonesia
citizen Yemen evacuation, with more than
2500 Indonesians saved in 2015. In such
situation Indonesian citizen were
transported to relatively safer place before
repatriated back to homeland, Indonesia.

The earthquake in Nepal back in 2015 also
noted as valuable experience in developing
system of protection. The government of
Indonesia evacuated hundreds of
Indonesian citizens who were trapped after
magnitude of 7.8 earthquake struck
Kathmandu and several camping ar eas for
mountaineers. The system developed were
as the Safe Travel, as experienced back in
Nepal, Indonesians can’t communicate one
another also less equipped to establish
communication line with the closest
Indonesian embassy. The Nepal experience
also noted as the first successful evacuation
overseas in effective collaboration with
Indonesian Military (TNI) and Indonesia
NGOs focusing on environmental issues.

There also several recorded efforts of
protection not only noting on more
collaboration with rel ated agencies in
Indonesia and ownership of Indonesian
citizen protection system overseas but also
in more information technology adoption.
The adoption of technology also partly
advanced under pandemic of COVID -19
situation. Starting with evacuation of 24 3

Indonesians from epicenter of COVID -19 in
Wuhan, China.

As the epidemic COVID -19 progressed to
pandemic, the global travel restriction
began. Indonesian citizen all over the world
suddenly facing drastic difficult situation.

Recorded since the start o f pandemic in
February 2020, as per Dec 24 th, 2021,
Indonesian government has facilitated
repatriation of 249.448 Indonesians
(195.931 are from Malaysia, the other
25.066 are Indonesians from all over the
world, also 28.452 Indonesian migrant
sailors eithe r stranded or facing other
difficulties abroad has been facilitated in
repatriating back to our homeland. Further,
Indonesia government through embassies
has also provided logistical help for
vulnerable Indonesians overseas. In 2020,
total of 525.264 package of logistic help had
been delivered (around 400.000 delivered
for vulnerable Indonesian in Malaysia); as
for 2021, total of 236.148 packages of
logistic help for Indonesian citizen across
Malaysia has been delivered.

Linking back to Indonesia experienc e for
manifesting protection of citizens overseas
has established several important
milestones, namely (1) operating procedure
and mechanism both for traditional and non-
traditional challenge in citizen protection
overseas, (2) technology adoption for
inclusivity of protection system, and (3)
Indonesia citizen protection ownership has
been diversified as not only sole
government effort but also in active
collaboration to other parties both from
private to NGOs.

2. Protection of Citizens in Consular
Perspective
The function of the consul arose before that
of the permanent ambassador and, to some
extent, can be considered its antecedent.
The consul existed prior to the
establishment of the state system. In today's
world, the role of consular services in citizen
protection is expressed in several ways:
cautionary advice to travelers and warnings
about the limits of government support;
increased use of technology to deliver travel
advice, citizen registrati on, passport
issuance and advice, as well as direct
evacuation in emergencies overseas.

Consular diplomacy provides underutilized
possibilities for conveying how 'abstract'
foreign policy concerns are considerably
closer to citizens' safety and security t han
they appear. Concerning the issues ranging
from emergency management to vulnerable
clients such as children, families, people
suffering from mental illnesses, and clients
arrested or detained, to migrant workers

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
97

and the international workforce, all are
outside the scope of traditional consular aid.

Referring the history of consuls and the
consul system and relate it to diplomacy
today and in the past  (Leira, Halvard, and
Iver B. Neumann , 1930:322) . Leira and
Neumann find that consular responsibilities
were frequently unrelated to diplomacy in
the past, and that consular activities have
been prioritized when the international
system is believed to be changing.
Diplomacy is more fluid and less bound to
the goal of establishing sovereignty than the
consul system. Contrary to popular belief,
consular services extend beyond traditional
services and serve as an integral aspect of
citizen protection abroad in general. It also
serves as an interface between MFAs and
the general public.

For most individuals, the consular function
is the foreign ministry's public face and their
only engagement with it. As a result, the
capacity to offer competent consular
services as part of citizen protection
overseas is critical to the ministry's and
government's credibility. (Oliver Alex, 2016:
683).

Today's MFAs recognize that providing
services to their own residents is part of
their mission —and MFAs are continuously
reminded that the perceived quality of such
services has a direct influence on the MFA's
own reputation at home. As a result, it
should come as no surprise that consular
matters are now receiving priority attention
at the highest levels in a growing number of
MFAs.

The Vienna Convention on Consular
Relations, signed in 1963, is the
international legal framework that governs
consular relations. It is currently more over
60 years old and less adaptable to many
modern consular concerns.  However, there
has been little desire for revisiting the
Convention for fear of jeopardizing the
"minimum criteria embedded in the
framework and unwittingly leaving the
Convention worse off." (Joanna Simonow:
5). As a result, international cooperation and
collaboration in consular services as part of
citizen protection overseas , as well as
supporting bil ateral agreements to address
common challenges, play a larger role.

All in all, the consular viewpoint on the
protection of citizens abroad raises three
problems. First, the government's consular
support remains under the 'coordinated
method,' which is in efficient. Second, in
times of crisis management, excellent state -
to-state ties and the individuals you know
are important. Official channels are
inefficient and ineffective. Third, high politics
have a limited impact on consular aid (here

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
98

referred to as l ow politics), implying that
open political issues normally do not impede
consular collaboration.

Such concerns are manifested in handling
of COVID-19 pandemics. As nations closed
their borders and travel across them
became increasingly difficult, one of t he
primary concerns became the repatriation of
their own nationals. This also resulted in a
shift in the task force of the consular
departments of the MFAs, which for a brief
while reduced work on their usual
responsibilities in order to focus on the
repatriation issue.

The perilous situation in the early handling
of the pandemic demonstrates the need of
crisis management within the context of
consular support. When there is a need to
assist citizens of the sending state, that
state may, within the bounds of international
law, engage in any activity that prevents or
improves the plight of its nationals abroad.

Another lesson from the first wave of Covid -
19 is that personal ties are significantly
more essential than other variables in
diplomatic relations (in the br oadest sense)
(e.g., membership in the international
organization, foreign policy orientation etc.).
Because time is of the essence, and it must
be utilized wisely, phoning someone you
know personally is significantly more
productive than going via formal means.
Diplomacy in a crisis consequently
bypasses formal channels in favor of
unofficial ones.

3. Protection of Citizens in Foreign
Policy Perspectives
The affordances produced by modern
communication technologies are
responsible for the greater move to a
citizen-driven practice of duty of protection.
New digital technologies provide up new
avenues for citizen participation, where the
"information revolut ion" and "direct public
involvement in international interaction"
become inextricably linked.

Fundamentally, the consular dimension of
diplomacy highlights the long -standing
marginalization of the sociocultural
dimension of global politics and diplomacy.
That topic is being addressed in the current
rise of public diplomacy studies, reflecting
the mostly concealed truth that, despite their
differences, consular work and public
diplomacy are somehow related activities.

Consular services are part of a wider trend
in modern diplomatic practice. Many
ordinary folks who have no special interest
in foreign politics or diplomacy have found
the MFA's importance as a result of their
increasingly cosmopolitan lifestyles. They
regard consular affairs as 'diplomacy for

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
99

people,' and consular affairs may thus be
viewed as an activity that aids in the
strengthening of the relationship between
the MFA and its domestic constituency.

Understanding the protection of citizens
from the standpoint of foreign policy. Recent
interests include collective initiatives for
shared consular services outside the region,
collaboration on natural disaster preparation
and response, international health
protection for travelers, promotion of
international private law regimes on child
abduction and family disputes, and worker
protection agreements.

The interests to provide better protection of
citizens overseas must also considering (a)
a functional perspective to determine
whether rights and policy objectives can be
pursued and balanced again st one another;
(b) an organizational perspective to ensure
that institutions and bodies have the
resources to carry out their responsibilities;
(c) a procedural perspective to determine
whether core values and rights are fulfilled
and realized through pro cedural provisions
and forms of act; and (d) an accountability
perspective to determine whether acts are
reasoned and justified, and that there is
accountability.

Furthermore, the government's efforts to
develop foreign policy as a direct result of
the issue of citizen safety may be examined
through the expansion of partnerships with
the business sector, non -governmental
organizations, other governments, and
international organizations. Engagement in
diaspora outreach has also resulted in the
identification of national foreign policy in
strengthening citizen safeguards. Diaspora
policies indirectly engage host governments
in possible advantages such as two -way
commerce and investment, as well as
occasional disagreements.

While different types of protection  for
citizens abroad have existed for millennia,
the roots of present diplomatic protection
procedures are inextricably related to the
modern sovereign state's construction. A
broader scholarly perspective on consular
affairs may even be of some practical help
since MFAs may benefit from more thought
on consular matters in the context of other
foreign ministry difficulties.

4. Protection of Indonesian Citizens
as an Integral Part of Indonesian
Diplomacy
Indonesia is grappling with the protection of
a rapidly expanding population of vulnerable
expatriate workers/PMIs who give crucial
remittances to the national economy. It may
be interpreted as not only the successful
execution of consular tasks, which are
trademarks of government legitimacy, but

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
100

also as an int rinsic aspect of Indonesian
diplomacy, as indicated in national foreign
policy goals.

Juxtaposing contemporary diplomacy and
consular affairs —as distinct activities with
wholly different functions —doesn't help us
understand the significance of overlapping
areas of operation within foreign ministries
in articulating national foreign policy. The
policy itself is at the crossroads of shared
foreign and security policy, citizenship, and
basic rights protection, as well as public
administrative law and horizont al and
vertical collaboration of authorities.

Consular activities are not extinct; but they
may be done by persons other than
consular officers/diplomats; in other sorts of
missions; and may be less identifiable as
"consular" due to new nomenclature. This is
congruent with history: those undertaking
"consular" labor used to have various
names. He claims that the consular
institution has been "characterized by a
remarkable flexibility" throughout decades,
which should assuage MFAs' concerns.
(Jan Melissen eds, 2011:4).
MFAs must improve their conceptual
understanding of consular diplomacy and
demonstrate internally and externally how
this practical field connects with overall
foreign and security policy, while also
acknowledging that such linkages do not
imply that managing foreign policy or
consular affairs will be easier. This would
promote overall foreign policy cohesiveness
and may increase societal support for the
MFA's activities.

The only constant in diplomacy is the
changing of some issues/priorities . The
development or maturation of concerns
such as citizen protection abroad is not the
first alteration in these situations. The notion
and practice of consuls is likewise shifting
from commercial to civic interest.

Embassies across the world serve as a  vital
safety net for Indonesians. The Indonesian
Ministry of Foreign Affairs provides
guidance and support all around the world.
If necessary, Indonesia can also enlist the
assistance of partners and others. Every
year, the Indonesian MFA responds to
thousands of requests for assistance, both
at home and abroad.

These include significant examples of
Indonesians who have been injured, are in a
hospital, have been the victim of a violent
crime, or have died overseas. Frequently,
the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MFA) can assist swiftly and simply by
utilizing contacts and local support. The
MFA of Indonesia ensures that advice and
information are often updated so that the
MFA of Indonesia can assist those seeking

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
101

assistance in accessing local serv ices and
knowledge.

CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Conclusion
Even though the work in the consular
branch of diplomacy has historically been
considered as extremely administrative, the
consular function has increased and
become increasingly sophisticated  over the
last several decades. It is improbable that
the conditions that have fueled an increase
in overseas travel and raised expectations
of government consular support would
abate.

Connecting consular aid and foreign policy
is not without complication s, and these
issue links could affect foreign policy or
consular affairs administration.  Indonesian
diplomats must be consistent and
competent in using a citizen -centric
approach to providing greater protection
overseas and collaborating with home
institutions to carry out complete solutions
to Indonesian concerns abroad.

Diplomatic and consular officials can only
help persons who want to be assisted. This
means that while diplomatic and consular
aid might be valuable when an individual
recognizes that the  state is willing to assist
them, they are not obligated to use it.
These studies, which analyze various cases
ranging from terror attacks to crisis
management to human trafficking, reveal
not only the complexities of international
chains of protection a nd the dilemmas of
contemporary demands for protection, but
also the discourses and practices of
protection that are redrawing the very
demarcations of political communities.
Because citizens are no longer passive
beneficiaries of governmental protection,
but active providers of care for themselves,
the basic relationships between state and
society, and the duty for protection that
entails, become inversed.

However, in the case of Indonesians living
overseas, this relationship is in active flux.
The state,  as mandated by law, can be
active in providing protection for
Indonesians in need abroad, but it can also
connect with Indonesian communities and
diasporas abroad to empower Indonesians
abroad. These paradigms and behaviors
represent transitions in the pr otective
viewpoint from consular aid to foreign
policy.

The way forward will not just be about
observance of consular assistance to
provide Indonesian citizens overseas, but
also recognizing the facts that the protection
of Indonesian citizen abroad is an integral of
Indonesia diplomacy.

Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021

2. Recommendation
The Indonesian government's resources
restrict the amount of aid that can be
delivered, and in the future years, Indonesia
must commit to assisting people in the
greatest need first. The Indonesian
government must give appropriate and up -
to-date information to allow Indonesian
residents to address simple problems on
their own by providing guidance on local
contacts, local information, and local rules.

Indonesian embassies should give as much
information and assistance as they can.
However, with more requests and fewer
resources, priority of requests for direct aid
and support is becoming increasingly
important to guarantee that the connected
government agencies are assisting those in
greatest need first.
Indonesia must be diligent in monitoring
caseloads regionally, examining patterns in
travel across demographic groups,
permitting more effective communication,
and pushing for increased self-sufficiency. It
should look into the consular function's
resourcing as well as the consular cadre's
capacity to fulfill the demands of an
increasingly complex workload.

Prioritization should be based on various
variables, including the individual seeking
assistance's capacity, their location, if the
Indonesian government has an Embassy or
Consulate in the region, and local
conditions.

Aside from prioritizing, public outreach and
communications should be prioritized in
order to give greater protection overseas.
Expansion of public outreach to ensure
important pop ulations are addressed with
suitable messaging in order to ensure a
safe, legal, and methodical migration
process. As part of public outreach and
communication, Indonesian government
agencies should engage with the manpower
businesses, particularly the int ermediaries
for work overseas.

What is beyond the scope of this
introductory study is that globalization may
likely need new responsibilities for consular
affairs in defending individuals abroad as
part of the wider diplomatic effort. A more
in-depth examination of consular issues and
diverse types of diplomatic representation
might help us grasp the breadth of
diplomacy today.

Abstrak
Undang-Undang No. 33 Tahun 2014 tentang Jaminan Produk Halal (JPH) mengindikasikan
kemungkinan dijalinnya kerja sama saling pengakuan ( mutual recognition agreement, MRA) antara
Indonesia dengan negara lain. Permasalahannya, sulit menemukan mitra kerja sama yang setara
dengan Badan Pengelola JPH Kementerian Agama di luar negeri. Lalu, bagaimana praktik kerja sama
itu diupayakan selama ini? Apa saja potensi, peluang dan tantangan terwujudnya kerjasama MRA
tersebut?
Riset kualitatif yang mengumpulkan data dari kajian literatur dan wawancara narasumber di dalam dan
luar negeri ini, mencoba mencari jawaban atas dua pert anyaan tersebut. Data yang terkumpul dianalisis
dengan menggunakan pendekatan intermestic (international-domestic) yang melihat pertautan dinamika
implementasi UU JPH di dalam negeri dengan urusan internasional, dan sebaliknya. Dilakukan juga
analisis SWOT  atas kondisi yang ada, serta studi komparasi untuk menemukan skema MRA yang
cocok untuk Indonesia.
Riset menemukan bahwa hingga artikel ini ditulis belum satu pun MRA atau MoU terkait sertifikasi halal
yang berhasil dibangun. Potensi dan peluang kerja s ama belum cukup dioptimalkan menghadapi
tantangannya. Upaya-upaya yang dilakukan pun masih minim, untuk tidak mengatakan tidak ada sama
sekali. Sedangkan potensi dan peluang ke depan masih cukup memberi harapan, meski tantangan
internal dan eksternal yang tidak juga sederhana. Perlu penguatan kesadaran faktor intermestik di
dalam mengelola JPH, sehingga upaya penataan (potensi dan peluang) di dalam negeri, dapat
meyakinkan stakeholders di manapun tentang penyelenggaraan sertifikasi halal di Indonesia.
Penguatan potensi dan peluang, pada gilirannya, akan menggeser tantangan -tantangan yang dihadapi.
Salah satunya dengan mengikuti skema MRA yang homegrown ala Indonesia.

sama dengan 45 (empat puluh lima) LHLN
di luar negeri (lihat Lampiran 1). LPPOM -
MUI mengakui sertifikat halal yang
dikeluarkan oleh LHLN tersebut hanya
untuk produ k yang diproduksi di negara
tempat lembaga sertifikasi halal berada,
kecuali untuk produk yang diproduksi di
Eropa. Sertifikasi halal Eropa dapat meng -
cover produk di seluruh Eropa, bukan
pernegara.

Dari daftar LHLN yang telah bekerja sama
dengan LPPOM -MUI tersebut, 14 LHLN
berdomisili di 12 negara -negara Eropa,
yakni: Austria, Belanda, Belgia, Denmark,
Italia, Inggris, Irlandia, Jerman, Polandia,
Spanyol, Swiss, dan Turki.

Dari latar belakang tersebut, terdapat
setidaknya dua permasalahan yang penting
mendapat perhatian dan pengkajian lebih
lanjut. Pertama, bahwa m ekanisme kerja
sama antara LPPOM -MUI dengan LHLN di
luar negeri tersebut memerlukan pengakuan
oleh pemerintah setempat dengan
Pemerintah RI ( G to G agreement ) dalam
bentuk kerja sama saling peng akuan
(Mutual Recognition Agreement /MRA)
sesuai dengan tuntutan UU JPH —terutama
Pasal 6 butir d UU JPH, dan Pasal 11 butir
c, PP 31/2019.

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
106

Kedua, s ebagian besar negara -negara di
kawasan Eropa menganut paham
sekularisme sehingga tidak memiliki
Kementerian/Lembaga (K/L) yang khusus
menangani isu keagamaan, termasuk
persoalan halal. Dengan demikian, tidak
ada K/L yang ekuivalen dengan tugas dan
fungsi BPJPH atau Kementerian Agama.
Namun demikian, isu halal dapat dilihat dari
pendekatan akses pasar produk Eropa  ke
Indonesia.

Dari latar belakang dan rumusan masalah di
atas, dapat dirumuskan setidaknya dua
pertanyaan penelitian, yakni: pertama,
bagaimana kerja sama saling pengakuan
(Mutual Recognition Agreement,  MRA)
Sertifikat Halal antara Indonesia dan
negara-negara Eropa telah dilakukan. Dan
kedua, bagaimana peluang, potensi, dan
tantangan kerja sama saling pengakuan
Sertifikat Halal di negara -negara kawasan
Eropa, khususnya di 5 dari 12 negara
domisili LHLN yang telah bekerja sama
dengan LPPOM-MUI?

METODE/KERANGKA BERPIKIR
Kajian mengenai implementasi jaminan
produk halal dan sertifikasi Halal di
Indonesia telah cukup banyak dilakukan,
baik di lingkungan perguruan tinggi, praktisi
halal, maupun Litbang Kementerian Agama.
Hanya saja, kajian yang khusu s
menyangkut kerja sama pengakuan
sertifikat Halal dan dengan lembaga luar
negeri, masih terbilang langka. Beberapa
kajian terkait kerja sama sertifikasi halal,
standarisasi, dan lembaga pengelola halal,
dapat membantu melatari kajian ini.

Al-Fatih dan Ad itya (2017 : 56 ),
memperbandingkan hukum fatwa halal di
beberapa negara dari sisi kajian yuridis
fatwa halal MUI dan fatwa halal dari
lembaga lain di luar negeri. Bahwa status
fatwa MUI itu tidak mengikat melainkan
sebuah rekomendasi semata. Secara
kelembagaan pun masih semi -pemerintah.
Di banyak negara, pemberi sertifikat halal
(baik negeri atau swasta) memiliki standar
resmi tersendiri yang sebagiannya diperkuat
oleh aturan negara, seperti JAKIM Malaysia
dan MUIS Singapura. Uniknya, di
Indonesia, banyak re gulasi yang
mendasarkan secara substansial pada
fatwa MUI, sehingga kekuatannya
mengikat. Sedangkan di luar negeri,
meskipun lembaganya milik pemerintah
namun fatwanya tidak mengikat dan lemah
diikuti masyarakatnya.

Sementara itu, Boca, dkk. (2014 : 25 )
menemukan bahwa sertifikasi kualitas
produk menjadi perhatian di dunia usaha.
Sertifikat ISO dan Sertifikat halal dipandang
sebagai upaya penjaminan kualitas yang
menguntungkan baik untuk konsumen

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
107

maupun produsen. Lebih jauh, bagi
Pemerintah, ISO dan Sertifi kat halal bukan
sekadar simbol kualitas melainkan juga
menuntut perhatian, dalam hal tantangan
penentuan ukuran kualitas, edukasi publik,
dan kualitas kehidupan.

Artadita dan Lestari (2019 : 105 )
memperbandingkan dua lembaga penerbit
Sertifikat Halal, yakni LPPOM -MUI
Indonesia dengan JAKIM Malaysia dalam
hal Sertifikasi Rumah Potong Halal.
Ditemukan bahwa standar keduanya relatif
sama meski ada sedikit perbedaan. Ada
empat aktivitas sertifikasi, yakni:
pendaftaran, pembayaran, audit dan
penerbitan serti fikat. Kriterianya
sertifikasinya pun relatif sama.

Sementara itu, terkait kerja sama saling
pengakuan (Mutual Recognition Agreement,
MRA) antarnegara, kajian Safari Ar -Rizki
(2010: 45 ) memberi gambaran
implementasi MRA dalam level antarnegara
di Asia Ten ggara (ASEAN). Penelitian
dalam rangka tesis studi master ini
menjelaskan sejarah MRA dan contoh
implementasinya dalam konteks kerja sama
ASEAN.

Dari sejumlah penelitian tersebut di atas,
tampak ada keunikan dan kesetaraan
standar, sekaligus peluang kerja  sama
antara lembaga pengelola halal, hanya saja
belum ada yang secara khusus melihat isu
kerja sama internasional dalam saling
pengakuan sertifikat halal. Pada titik itulah
penelitian ini menemukan distingsi dan
urgensinya. Kebaruan ( novelty) penelitian
kali ini terletak pada lingkup kajiannya yang
menyentuh isu halal, serta lokus yang
mengkaji Eropa.

Penelitian ini menggunakan pendekatan
kualitatif dengan kajian pustaka  dan
wawancara, untuk mendapatkan berbagai
data dan informasi yang dibutuhkan. Kajian
pustaka dan penelusuran ranah maya
dilakukan untuk mendalami isu ini,
mendapatkan data -data faktual dan aktual
mengenai persoalan ini, serta mendu dukan
kajian ini di dalam state of the art  ilmu
pengetahuan terkini.

Wawancara dilakukan untuk mendiskusika n
dan mendalami isu, mengklari fikasi atau
memverifikasi data dan temuan awal, serta
mendapatkan masukan untuk menjawab
pertanyaan penelitian ini. Guna
mendapatkan gambaran seutuh mungkin,
wawancara dilakukan dengan melibatkan
11 (sebelas) informan yang me wakili
pemangku kepentingan sertifikasi halal di
dalam dan luar negeri, yaitu (1) Kalangan
pemangku kebijakan/Pemerintah, seperti:
BPJPH Kementerian Agama dan direktorat -
direktorat yang menangani kerja sama
negara-negara Eropa Kemenlu, untuk

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
108

memahami regulasi dan berbagai kebijakan
terkait; (2) Kalangan praktisi, seperti:
LPPOM-MUI, peneliti isu halal di universitas
dan lembaga riset, LSM isu halal,
pengusaha/importir, dsb, untuk melihat
aspirasi kalangan pelaksana di lapangan
terkait sertifikasi dan registrasi halal; dan (3)
Kalangan stakeholders di luar negeri,
seperti Perwakilan/Kedutaan di lima dari
dua belas negara Eropa, yakni negara -
negara di bawah Direktorat Eropa II pada
Kementerian Luar Negeri, yakni: Austria,
Jerman, Polandia, Swiss, dan Denmark.

Selain itu, karena membutuhkan data dan
perspektif langsung dari beberapa Lembaga
Halal Luar Negeri (LHLN) di negara -negara
Uni Eropa, dan untuk menyiasati
keterbatasan dana untuk melakukan direct
data-collection, maka dibuat ‘Angket Isian’
yang dikirimka n melalui email. Proses
transkripsi dan penerjemahan dilakukan
dalam proses ini.

Data dan informasi selanjutnya dianalisa
menggunakan perangkat regulasi yang ada
di ranah internasional terkait perdagangan,
kerja sama -diplomasi, dan lainnya; juga di
ranah nasional, seperti UU Jaminan Produk
Halal, serta regulasi turunannya. Beberapa
teori tentang kerja sama internasional
seperti pendekatan intermestik
(international-domestic approach ), dipakai
dalam menganalisis data. Demikian halnya,
digunakan juga analisis SWOT ( Strength,
Weaknesses, Opportunity, and Threats )
untuk melihat dan menimban g kondisi -
kondisi yang ada.

Mutual Recognition Agreement
Mutual Recognition Agreement atau yang
biasa disingkat MRA merupakan langkah
signifikan menuju liberalisasi perdagangan.
MRA bertujuan untuk mengurangi
hambatan teknis untuk perdagangan
(technical barrier to trade, TBT).

Dengan terjalinnya MRA, maka
memungkinkan suatu produk atau jasa yang
telah diuji di negara pengekspor atau
negara lain untuk diterima oleh negara
pengimpor dengan sedikit pengujian atau
sertifikasi lebih lanjut, tetapi tetap tun duk
pada pengawasan pasar. Hal ini diyakini
sebagai efisiensi biaya yang signifikan
sehingga akan menghasilkan harga yang
lebih rendah bagi konsumen.

MRA menciptakan kerangka kerja untuk
saling mengakui sistem penilaian
kesesuaian nasional antara dua atau  lebih
negara. Fase pertama MRA mencakup
penerimaan bersama atas laporan
pengujian salah satu negara yang
menandatangani MRA untuk menghindari
pengujian ulang tetapi masih memerlukan
sertifikasi nasional di negara penerima.

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
109

Fase kedua adalah penerimaan ber sama
atas sertifikasi sehingga tidak hanya hasil
pengujian yang diterima, tetapi juga
sertifikasi yang memungkinkan barang
langsung masuk pasar negara penerima.
MRA mengurangi atau menghilangkan
biaya pengujian ulang dan sertifikasi ulang,
memperpendek wak tu pemasaran untuk
produsen dan eksportir barang. Konsumen
mendapatkan keuntungan dari biaya yang
lebih rendah dan ketersediaan yang lebih
cepat. Di bawah MRA, vendor menikmati
penghematan biaya yang signifikan karena
tidak perlu menguji ulang dan menserti fikasi
ulang peralatan mereka di negara
pengimpor. Mereka juga langsung masuk
ke pasar, menghemat beberapa minggu
penundaan. Misalnya, di Singapura
diperkirakan penghematan untuk dapat SG
$ 1.200 dan hingga 30 hari - biaya dan
waktu yang diperlukan untuk p engujian
ulang lokal ( www.ida.gov.sg). Namun,
efisiensi biaya dan waktu dalam kerangka
MRA tidak dirasakan oleh semua pihak.
Amerika Serikat mengkritik beberapa mitra
dagangnya karena kelambanan perangkat
telekomunikasi (www.ustr.gov).

Pelaksanaan MRA umumnya membutuhkan
undang-undang nasional dan peraturan
teknis. Misalnya, peraturan perundang -
undangan di Jepang memung kinkan
perusahaan menggunakan lembaga
pemeriksa asing di bawah kerangka MRA
Jepang dengan UE dan AS. Gambar berikut
menunjukkan sistem MRA di Jepang.

Uni Eropa telah mengambil pendekatan
yang leb ih radikal dalam upayanya untuk
menciptakan pasar tunggal dengan
menggunakan standar umum di seluruh
negara anggota. Dengan menerapkan
sistem standar umum, akan terjadi
penghematan biaya dan waktu pemasaran.
Skema MRA juga lazim diterapkan di
banyak organi sasi regional, seperti APEC,

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
110

ASEAN, Organization of American States
(OAS), Economic Community Of West
African States (ECOWAS), hingga East
African Community (EAC).

ASEAN telah mengadopsi skema MRA
antara lain pada bidang Engineering
Services (9 December 2005); Nursing
Services (8 December 2006); Architectural
Services and Framework Arrangement for
the Mutual Recognition of Surveying
Qualifications (19 November 2007); Medical
Practitioners and MRA on Dental
Practitioners (26 February 2009);
Accountancy Ser vices (26 February 2009,
13 November 2014); dan Tourism
Professional (9 November 2012).

Faktor Intermestik Kebijakan Halal
Penelitian ini mempertautkan UU Jaminan
Produk Halal di Indonesia dengan isu
hubungan internasional, yakni kerja sama
internasional di bidang halal. Dengan kata
lain, pada tingkat tertentu kajian ini melihat
dinamika hubungan domestik dengan
internasional yang saling bertautan dan
saling mempengaruhi satu sama lain
(intermestik).
Metode ini, yang dijelaskan beberapa
dekade lalu oleh Rosenau (1969: 20),
menyebutkan bahwa kajian politik
internasional akan dimajukan dengan
mengkaji lebih dekat keterkaitan antara
sistem politik dalam negeri dan implikasinya
terhadap urusan internasional. Secara
konvensional, politik luar negeri merup akan
proyeksi dari politik domestik (Wolff dan
Wurm, 2011: 16; Fearon, 1998: 33).

Namun, dengan perkembangan teknologi
informasi yang semakin mutakhir dan
globalisasi yang memudarkan batas
wilayah, batas-batas antara politik domestik
dan politik internasi onal juga menjadi tidak
relevan. Bahkan politik domestik memiliki
pengaruh yang signifikan terhadap interaksi
hubungan internasional dan begitu juga
sebaliknya.

Pendekatan ini dikenal dengan “intermestik”
(internasional-domestik) yang dikenalkan
pertama kali oleh Manning (1979 : 3 ).
Manning (1979 : 5 ) menyatakan bahwa
kebijakan luar negeri memiliki pengaruh
langsung yang sangat kuat di ranah
domestik sehingga perdebatan yang
mendasari kebijakan tersebut sebaiknya
memperhatikan aspek internasional dan
domestik sekaligus.

Pada mulanya konsepsi awal Manning
tentang intermestik bicara tentang ekonomi
politik internasional dan ekonomi domestik.
Kemudian Barilleaux (1985 : 10 )
memperluas spektrum intermestik dengan
memasukkan pengaruh kebijakan luar
negeri terhad ap opini publik domestik dan
dampak kebijakan luar negeri dari opini

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
111

publik. Hal itu diperkuat oleh Logevall
(2001: 15 ) yang mengembangkan lebih
lanjut konsep kebijakan internasional yang
mempengaruhi atau berimplikasi pada
wacana domestik. Senada dengan i tu,
Bueno de Mesquita & Smith (2012 : 20 )
berpendapat bahwa hampir setiap variabel
dependen kritis dalam arena internasional
dewasa ini dapat dieksplorasi melalui lensa
politik dalam negeri.

Berangkat dari intermestik ini, teori “two-
level game” Putnam (1988: 9) menjelaskan
bahwa para pemimpin nasional harus
memenangkan permainan politik dalam
negeri dan permainan internasional selama
proses pembuatan kebijakan luar negeri,
terutama pada isu -isu internasional yang
sensitif dengan dampak luas pad a
konstituen domestik. Putnam (1988)
membahas bahwa kemenangan seorang
pemimpin pada negosiasi di level domestik
dan internasional ini dipengaruhi oleh peran
preferensi dan koalisi domestik, institusi dan
praktik politik domestik, strategi dan taktik
negosiator, ketidakpastian, efek gaung
domestik dari tekanan inter nasional, dan
kepentingan kepala negosiator. Dengan
kata lain, “ two-level game ” telah
memperluas faktor-faktor penentu kebijakan
luar negeri, salah satunya faktor domestik
dan tekanan internasional.

Para ahli hubungan internasional menyoroti
bahwa konsep urusan dalam negeri telah
menjadi semakin dominan di bidang sejarah
diplomatik selama dekade terakhir  (antara
lain Logevall, 2009 : 11 ; Gienow -Hecht,
2009: 36 ; Wolff dan Wurm, 2011 : 15 ).
Dengan d emikian, kajian hubungan
internasional lebih menitikberatkan pada
peran politik domestik dalam hubungan
internasional (Brenner & Vanderbush, 2002:
31; Foyle, 1997: 26; Milner & Tingley, 2015 :
14). Globalisasi telah meningkatkan
cakupan dan kedalaman interaksi antara
politik dalam negeri dan politik luar negeri,
menjadikan politik luar negeri sebagai
bagian integral dari politik dalam negeri.

Dalam konteks Indonesia, sebagaimana
diuraikan oleh Anwar (1994 : 20 ), secara
umum telah diterima bahwa faktor domestik
sangat menentukan kebijakan luar negeri
Indonesia. Setelah jatuhnya pemerintahan
Soeharto pada tahun 1998, Indonesia
berupaya mengembangkan lingkungan
politik demokrasi yang lebih terbuka. Oleh
karena itu, dengan munculnya sistem politik
Indonesia pasca-Soeharto, demokratisasi
telah membuka baik pelaksanaan hubungan
internasional maupun pembuatan kebijakan
luar negeri kepada lebih banyak aktor yang
menantang eksekutif dalam perumusan
kepentingan dan strategi kebijakan luar
negeri (Anwar, 2010: 24; Hill, 2003: 15).

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
112

Demikian pula, studi tentang kebijakan luar
negeri dan demokratisasi Indonesia secara
umum sampai pada kesimpulan yang sama,
antara lain demokratisasi telah
menyebabkan pergeseran kekuasaan dari
eksekutif ke legislatif (Murphy, 2005: 16)
dan meningkatnya pengaruh aktor non -
pemerintah terhadap pembuatan kebijakan
luar negeri ( Vermonte, 2005: 26). Lebih
lanjut, Gindarsah (2012: 19) menekankan
bahwa kekuatan politik dalam negeri telah
menjadi kekuatan baru yang mempengaruhi
pemerintahan eksek utif untuk mengubah
dan bahkan membalikkan politik luar negeri
Indonesia yang ada untuk mengejar aspirasi
masyarakat dan ambisi politik masing -
masing.

Secara khusus, Dosch (2006 : 40 )
menjelaskan bahwa tiga bidang penting
yang mempengaruhi kebijakan luar n egeri
Indonesia berdasarkan perubahan dalam
negeri: proses pengambilan keputusan
kebijakan luar negeri, aktor yang terlibat,
dan isu -isu. Dosch berpendapat bahwa
lingkungan demokrasi baru telah membuka
proses pembuatan kebijakan luar negeri
dan memberikan akses kepada lebih
banyak 'aktor baru' untuk memperkenalkan
ide dan agenda tertentu dibandingkan
dengan di bawah rezim otoriter.

Dalam konteks penelitian ini, isu halal yang
sedianya merupakan isu keagamaan, kini
berkembang telah berkembang tidak hanya
menjadi agenda politik domestik, tetapi juga
menjadi agenda politik luar negeri yang
diperkenalkan oleh aktor baru yang terlibat.
Dengan UU 33/2014, isu halal memiliki
spektrum internasional yang sangat kuat
karena keterlibatan negara pada isu ini dan
melahirkan aktor-aktor domestik baru dalam
arena internasional.

DISKUSI/ANALISIS
Kerja sama Saling Pengertian (MRA)
Sertifikat Halal
Tujuan utama dari penelitian ini adalah
mengetahui dan menganalisis kondisi
existing dan upaya-upaya kerja sama saling
pengakuan sertifikat halal yang telah
dilakukan antara Indonesia dengan lima
negara di Eropa, yakni: Austria, Denmark,
Jerman, Polandia, dan Swiss. Dari
penelusuran literatur dan wawancara
dengan narasumber di dalam dan luar
negeri, diketahui bahwa hingga September
2020 ini belum ada satu pun perjanjian
kerjasama saling pengakuan ( Mutual
Recognition Agreemen t, MRA) terkait
sertifikasi halal yang dimiliki Indonesia
(sebagai negara) dengan negara -negara di
Eropa--bahkan negara lainnya di dunia.
Namun demikian , kerjasama saling
pengakuan sertifikasi halal telah terbangun
antara LPPOM MUI (lembaga swasta
pengelola halal di Indonesia sebelum rezim

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
113

UU 33/2014), dengan 45 lembaga sertifikasi
halal luar negeri di 26 negara
(selengkapnya lihat lampiran 1).
Permasalahannya adalah bahwa skema
MRA meniscayakan kerjasama negara -
dengan-negara (G to G), sehingga
kerjasama yang digalang LPPOM MUI
tersebut tidak  dapat dikategorikan MRA
dalam konteks kajian ini —yang merujuk
Pasal UU No. 33/2014 tentang Jaminan
Produk Halal, da n Peraturan Pemerintah
No. 31 Tahun 2019, dan Peraturan Menteri
Agama Nomor 26 Tahun 2019.

Sementara itu, upaya menjajaki dan
membangun kerjasama saling pengakuan
sertifikasi halal (baik berupa MRA ataupun
langkah awal berupa MoU, memorandum of
understanding) secara G to G telah
dilakukan. Hal ini misalnya tergambar dari
korespondensi antara Kementerian Luar
Negeri dengan BPJPH Kementerian Agama
RI, yang meneruskan surat dari Kedutaan
Besar RI di Wina, Austria. Bahwa sebuah
lembaga halal Austria bernama I slamic
Documentation and Certification (IIDC) telah
melayangkan permohonan kerja sama
pengakuan sertifikat halal kepada BPJPH
via KBRI Wina, dan dinyatakan telah
melengkapi semua dokumen administratif
yang diperlukan. Lalu, karena menurut
aturan perundang -undangan MRA
meniscayakan kerja sama G to G, maka
melalui surat Nomor B -
2731/BD.II/P.II.III/Hm.00/07/2020 tertanggal
27 Juli 2020, BPJPH menyambut baik
rencana penyusunan MoU dengan meminta
pihak Kemlu untuk mengundang perwakilan
Pemerintah Austria di Jaka rta untuk hadir
ke BPJPH untuk mendiskusikan rincian
MoU dimaksud. BPJPH juga setuju bahwa
penandatanganan MoU pada level Menteri.

Potensi, Peluang dan Tantangan MRA
1. Potensi MRA
Potensi MRA ini akan diuraikan secara
bilateral pernegara dengan meng analisis
tren perdagangan dengan Indonesia serta
secara multilateral melalui Uni Eropa dan
EFTA.
Secara bilateral, total nilai perdagangan
Indonesia dengan lima negara objek
penelitian cukup bervariasi. Pada tahun
2019, Jerman (US$ 5,8 miliar) dan Swiss
(US$ 1,4 miliar) memiliki total nilai
perdagangan terbesar, sedangkan Austria,
Denmark, dan Polandia relatif sama (sekitar
US$ 500 juta) yang akan diuraikan di bawah
ini.
Austria
Total nilai perdagangan Indonesia -Austria
cenderung stabil pada 2015 -2018 dan
mengalami penurunan yang signifikan pada
tahun 2019. Komoditas utama ekspor
Austria adalah obat -obatan yang dikenakan
wajib sertifikat halal berdasarkan UU

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
114

33/2014.  Mencermati tren perdagangan RI -
Austria pada lima tahun terakhir, total nilai
perdagangan R I-Austria belum
mencerminkan potensi sebenarnya. Dengan
kata lain, potensi terwujudnya MRA halal
antara kedua negara cukup besar karena
menjadi salah satu faktor pendorong
komoditas eksport Austria, yaitu obat -
obatan.



Pada sisi bilateral, RI -Austria dapat
memanfaatkan mekanisme bilateral Dialog
Lintas Agama (DLA) untuk mengangkat isu
halal dan perdagangan internasional.
Austria merupakan mitra DLA Indonesia
pertama sejak tahun 2009.
Denmark
Selama lima tahun terakhir (2014 -2019),
total nilai perdagan gan Indonesia -Denmark
cenderung stabil di kisaran US$ 400 juta.
Produk ekspor Indonesia lebih pada
komoditas dan manufaktur sederhana,
sementara impor produk Denmark
merupakan produk manufaktur berteknologi.
Komoditas ekspor utama Denmark antara
lain obat-obatan dan keju yang memerlukan
sertifikasi halal untuk masuk ke Indonesia.

Pada sisi bilateral, setelah kunjungan Ratu
Denmark tahun 2015, Kedubes Denmark di
Jakarta merevitalisasi Danish -Indonesian
Business Chamber/ DANCHAM (d/h Danish
Business Associ ation, 1984) untuk
memfasilitasi jaringan dan pertukaran
pengalaman antara pengusaha Denmark
dan mitra di Indonesia.
Mencermati temuan penelitian tersebut,
MRA halal berpotensi terjalin antara
Indonesia-Denmark guna meningkatkan

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
115

perdagangan kedua negara. Mengingat
Denmark merupakan negara anggota Uni
Eropa, maka MRA halal perlu diupayakan
melalui pendekatan Uni Eropa dengan
dukungan bilateral.
Jerman
Sebagai ekonomi terbesar nomor 1 di
Eropa, Jerman memiliki total nilai
perdagangan terbesar juga dengan
Indonesia. Berdasarkan data Kemendag RI,
total perdagangan RI -Jerman pada  2019
mencapai US$ 5,8 milyar dengan defisit di
pihak Indonesia sebesar US$ 1,09 milyar.

Produk ekspor Jerman ke Indonesia
umumnya barang manufaktur seperti
kendaraan bermotor, kendaraan
pengangkut, mesin untuk industri yang
memproduksi produk plastik, packaging,
peralatan, perkapalan, peralatan
komunikasi, barang kimia, peralatan
laboratorium. Sementara eksport Indonesia
ke Jerman berupa bahan baku berbasis
sumber daya alam meli puti CPO, karet
alam, kopi biji, kakao, barang tambang
mineral dan beberapa produk manufaktur
seperti alas kaki, tekstil dan produk tekstil,
furniture; komponen elektronik, komponen
otomotif dan ban.
Mencermati data temuan tersebut,
komoditas ekspor Jerman  ke Indonesia
didominasi oleh produk -produk yang tidak
memerlukan sertifikasi halal. Namun bukan
berarti MRA halal dengan Jerman
berpotensi nol. Jerman memiliki penduduk
muslim yang sangat signifikan, khususnya
berasal dari Turki dan Eropa Timur.
Di sampi ng itu, Jerman yang merupakan
ekonomi terbesar di Uni Eropa sangat
menentukan sekali jalannya perundingan
IEU CEPA dan masa depan Uni Eropa
secara keseluruhan.
Polandia
Berbeda dengan empat negara objek
penelitian lainnya yang mengalami tren total
nilai p erdagangan stabil bahkan menurun
dengan Indonesia, total nilai perdagangan
RI-Polandia justru meningkat ditopang
dengan surplus ekspor Indonesia ke
Polandia.
Komoditas ekspor unggulan Polandia ke
Indonesia antara lain whey; roducts
consisting of natural m ilk constituents .
(HS0404), Suku cadang untuk kendaraan

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
116

besar (HS8708), Produk perawatan
kecantikan (HS3304), Produk olahan besi
(HS7204), dan Derek kapal atau Crane
kapal (HS8426). Salah satu pasar prioritas
bagi produk ekspor Polandia, termasuk
produk-produk pertanian Polandia, yaitu
daging sapi, produk susu dan buah-buahan.


Melihat temuan penelitian terhadap
Polandia, komoditas ekspor Polandia ke
Indonesia didominasi oleh produk yang
memerlukan sertifikasi halal, seperti
gandum, daging sapi, produk susu dan
buah-buahan, serta kosmetik. Dengan
demikian, potensi MRA halal Indon esia-
Polandia sangat besar. Selain itu, Dialog
Lintas Budaya dan Agama (DLBA) RI -
Polandia juga dapat dimanfaatkan untuk
mengangkat isu kerja sama halal
berdasarkan UU 33/2014.
Swiss
Total nilai perdagangan RI -Swiss bergerak
fluktiatif dengan ditandai kenaikan signifikan
pada tahun 2016. Neraca perdagangan
bilateral surplus untuk Indonesia dengan
ditopang oleh ekspor Indonesia ke Swiss
didominasi oleh komoditas perhiasan dan
logam mulia (HS 711319) sebesar 74,5%,
disusul sepatu/alas kaki (HS 640399)
sebesar 5,09%. Adapun ekspor Swiss ke
Indonesia terdiri dari mesin, produk kimia,
alat komunikasi dan listrik, kendaraan
bermotor (mobil), produk metal, dan produk
farmasi.
Sementara banyak negara yang
menurunkan volume ekspor impornya
karena perhatian terpusat pa da
penanganan Covid 19, ekspor Indonesia ke
Swiss malah melonjak tajam. Dalam lima
bulan pertama tahun 2020 yaitu Januari –
Mei 2020 ekspor Indonesia naik sebesar
284% dibandingkan periode yang sama
tahun 2019.
Data Kemendag RI yang juga dikonfirmasi
oleh data Swiss Federal Customs
Administration menunjukkan bahwa
peningkatan terbesar terjadi dalam bulan
April dan Mei 2020 dengan peningkatan
ekspor Indonesia sebesar 670% untuk April
dan 404% untuk Mei 2020 dibandingkan
bulan yang sama tahun 2019. Kopi dan
minyak atsiri adalah diantara produk
Indonesia yang mengalami kenaikan
lumayan besar. Kenaikan ekspor Indonesia

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
117

ke Swiss terbesar terjadi dalam bulan Maret
2020 bila dibandingkan bulan sebelumnya
yaitu untuk produk tekstil rajutan, kopi, suku
cadang mesin,  mebel, minyak atsiri dan
kimia organik. Namun bila dibandingkan
dengan periode yang sama tahun lalu,
ekspor Indonesia ke Swiss yang memiliki
trend meningkat adalah logam mulia, alas
kaki, kopi, mebel, suku cadang mesin dan
minyak atsiri.

Pada setiap pertemuan Joint Economic and
Trade Committee, delegasi Swiss selalu
konsisten mengangkat isu halal di antara
isu-isu perdagangan dan investasi lainnya.
Isu sertifikasi halal dinilai akan berpengaruh
besar terhadap komoditas ekspor Indonesia
ke Swiss, yaitu produk farmasi.
Dengan kata lain, MRA halal berpotensi
besar untuk terjalin antara RI -Swiss. Selain
itu, temuan hasil wawancara juga
mengkonfirmasi bahwa Pemerintah Swiss
(c.q State Secretariat for Economic Affairs
SECO) mewacanakan untuk membentuk
unit khusus yang menangani isu halal
sebagai instru men perdagangan.
Sebagaimana diamanatkan dalam
peraturan perundanga-undangan Indonesia,
MoU G-to-G merupakan syarat kunci untuk
menjalin MRA halal.
Dewasa ini, produk Swiss yang masuk ke
Indonesia berupaya untuk mencantumkan
label halal. Hal itu menunjukan  kesadaran
produsen Swiss akan pentingnya label halal
bagi konsumen Indonesia. Namun, karena
belum terjalin MRA antara Indonesia -Swiss,
label halal produk impor Swiss di Indonesia
masih menggunakan dua label halal dari
LPPOM MUI dan HCS, sebagaimana
tercantum pada produk coklat Ovomaltine
ini yang dapat ditemukan di supermarket
Indonesia.

Gambar 6. Ilustrasi penggunaan 2 (dua)
label halal

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021

Penggunaan dua label halal dari negara
asal produk dan Indonesia tersebut akan
menambah biaya bagi produsen. Kondisi ini
membuka peluang lebih besar bagi
terwujudnya MRA sertifikasi halal
Indonesia-Swiss.
Multilateral
Empat dari lima negara objek penelitian ini
(Austria, Denmark, Jerman, dan Polandia)
merupakan anggota Uni Eropa. Sebagai
anggota Uni Eropa, empat negara tersebut
terikat dan memiliki kepentingan dalam
proses perundingan Indonesia – UE
Comprehensive Econom ic Partnership
Agreement (IEU-CEPA), karena kebijakan
perdagangan dan bea cukai masing -masing
negara mengacu pada kebijakan Uni Eropa.
Indonesia dan Uni Eropa memulai negosiasi
Comprehensive Economic Partnership
Agreement (IEU-CEPA) sejak tahun 2016.
Sebagai anggota Uni Eropa, hubungan
bilateral Indonesia dengan empat negara
tersebut ditandai dengan Framework
Agreement on Comprehensive Partnership
and Cooperation ( PCA) yang mulai berlaku
tahun 2014 dan memberikan fondasi yang
kuat untuk kerja sama RI -Uni Er opa ke
depan. Dalam strateginya, Uni Eropa
memajukan agenda bilateral dan sekaligus
memajukan agenda di ASEAN. Sebagai
ilustrasi, Uni Eropa memandang Free Trade
Agreement secara bilateral negara -negara
ASEAN adalah building blocks menuju EU-
ASEAN FTA.
Selain empat negara objek penelitian yang
menjadi anggota Uni Eropa, Swiss adalah
satu-satunya negara yang bukan anggota
Uni Eropa, melainkan anggota European
Free Trade Association  (EFTA). Indonesia-
EFTA Comprehensive Economic
Partnership Agreement (CEPA) tel ah
ditandatangani pada 18 Desember 2018 di
Jakarta dan akan berlaku menunggu
ratifikasi oleh DPR RI.
Sebagai Perjanjian Perdagangan Bebas
yang luas, Indonesia -EFTA CEPA
mencakup perdagangan barang,
perdagangan jasa, investasi, hak kekayaan
intelektual, pengadaan pemerintah,
persaingan, perdagangan, serta
pembangunan dan kerja sama yang
berkelanjutan. Di bidang perdagangan
barang, Negara -negara EFTA menghapus
semua bea masuk atas impor produk
industri, termasuk ikan dan hasil laut
lainnya, yang berasal da ri Indonesia.
Indonesia secara bertahap akan
menghapus atau mengurangi bea masuk
atas produk industri, termasuk ikan dan
produk laut lainnya, yang berasal dari
Negara EFTA.
Tidak terdapat item khusus yang
menyebutkan sertifikasi halal pada
Indonesia-EFTA C EPA. Namun Indonesia -
EFTA CEPA secara umum menguatkan

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
119

tentang perjanjian TBT ( Technical Barriers
to Trade) dan perjanjian SPS ( sanitary and
phytosanitary) pada WTO yang juga
diadopsi pada CEPA ini.
Melihat perkembangan yang terjadi,
terdapat potensi MRA halal dalam kerangka
multilateral, baik negosiasi Indonesia -EU
CEPA yang masih berlangsung maupun
Indonesia-EFTA CEPA yang sudah selesai.
Pada negosiasi Indonesia -EU CEPA,
sertifikasi halal dan MRA halal kiranya perlu
menjadi salah satu mata agenda negosia si.
Keterlibatan BPJPH menjadi penting karena
halal bukan sebatas aspek keagamaan,
melainkan sebagai instrumen perdagangan.
Sedangkan pada kerangka Indonesia -EFTA
CEPA yang sudah selesai, potensi MRA
justru lebih besar terjalin di bawah
adminstasi Joint Committee CEPA.

2. Peluang MRA
Secara internal, Indonesia memiliki potensi
terbangunnya MRA di bidang halal dengan
berbagai negara di dunia, termasuk di
Eropa. Indonesia telah memiliki Undang -
undang dan turunannya yang khusus
mengatur soal isu halal. Bahkan  di UU dan
turunannya itu terdapat pasal da klausul
yang memberi kesempatan atau
kemungkinan dilaksanakannya MRA, yakni
Pasal 46 UU JPH. Namun demikian, Ihsan
menegaskan kata “dapat” dalam Pasal 46
tersebut. Artinya, klausul kerjasama MRA
itu bisa dilakukan atau tidak (Wawancara 27
Juli 2020).

Meski hingga saat ini belum ada satupun
MRA antara Indonesia dengan negara lain,
namun peluang ke arah terjalinnya
kesepakatan saling pengakuan (MRA) atau
memo kesepahaman (MoU) dalam isu halal
terbuka lebar. Peluan g di sini artinya faktor
eksternal yang bernuansa positif bagi
kemungkinan terbangunnya kesepakatan
tersebut.

Pertama, peluang terbangunnya MRA
masih dipandang cukup besar karena kita
Indonesia menjadi pasar barang -halal
negara-negara di Eropa tersebut, spt
daging, susu, dan coklat. Dengan demikian,
mereka akan menempuh jalan apapun
termasuk diawali dengan membuat MRA
dengan Indonesia untuk dapat memper -
lancar ekspansi bisnis mereka tersebut.
Selain disampaikan Taufik, perwakilan di
KBRI Polandia, pendapat ini didukung Adi,
perwakilan di KBRI Austria. Dikatakan Adi,
“...jadi mereka memang confident ya,
karena mereka meli hat demand
Indonesia besar, memiliki pasar
yang besar. Dan produk -produk
Eropa itu memang sudah banyak
yang masuk, terutama kelas
menengah ya di Indonesia. Itu kan
makin banyak orang yang dari
golongan bawah yang naik ke
kalangan menengah, yang lebih
banyak demand -nya, termasuk

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
120

barang-barang dari Eropa seperti
coklat impor, atau barang -barang
olahan. Mereka [negara -negara
Eropa, pen] melihat peluang ini
makanya mereka usul terus [adanya
kerjasama] dan salah satunya tadi
yang G to G .”  (wawancara 5
Agustus 2020).
Lebih jauh lagi, ketika telah terbanguan
Perjanjian Kemitraan Ekonomi
Komprehensif ( Comprehensive Economic
Partnership Agreement, CEPA), peluangnya
lebih banyak lagi. Di Swiss, misalnya,
setelah CEPA diratifikasi, produk Swiss
ingin membanjiri pasa r kita. Dikatakan
Nuradi,
”Apalagi kalau dia mempunyai cap
halal di situ, itu bisa lebih masuk ke
segala jenis sektor barang di
situ….peluangnya sangat besar
masuk ke Indonesia,” imbuh Nuradi,
perwakilan di KBRI Bern. Demikian
halnya di Denmark, menurut D ini,
perwakilan di KBRI Kopenhagen,
“Denmark memandang kita sebagai
pasarnya, dan diantara negara
ASEAN lainnya pun, mereka
memandang kita lebih tinggi
daripada negara ASEAN lainnya. ”
(wawancara 27 Juli 2020).
Kedua, secara informal (non-governmental
scheme) Indonesia telah memiliki
kerjasama pengakuan halal dengan 45
lembaga sertifikasi halal luar negeri di 26
negara (daftar nama sebagaimana lampiran
1). Lembaga -lembaga ini adalah mereka
yang selama ini bekerjasama dan diakui
sertifikat halalnya oleh Ma jelis Ulama, atau
tepatnya LPPOM MUI. Sebagaimana
diketahui, LPPOM MUI mengakui sertifikat
halal yang dikeluarkan oleh badan sertifikasi
halal asing yang telah bekerjasama, yang
disetujui berlaku selama 2 (dua) tahun dan
dievaluasi per tahunnya. Mereka ter diri atas
37 badan yang disetujui untuk kategori
pemotongan (sapi), 40 badan disetujui
untuk kategori bahan baku, 22 badan
disetujui untuk kategori rasa. Sejak
berlakunya UU JPH dan menunggu
peraturan dan prosedur baru pengakuan
Lembaga Sertifikasi Halal d isusun oleh MUI
dan Pemerintah, daftar ini masih diacu dan
digunakan oleh LPPOM MUI
(http://www.halalmui.org/mui14/main/page/li
st-of-halal-certification-bodies).

Peluang membangun “G to G” MRA dengan
melanjutkan “kerjasama B to B” ini
diusulkan Lukmanul Hakim, Direktur
LPPOM MUI. Dikatakannya,
“Maka langkah yang paling mudah
saat ini adalah tinggal merilis
lembaga-lembaga halal yang sudah
diakui oleh Majelis Ulama Indonesia.
Kemudian untuk additional -nya
adalah menggunakan prosedur yang
sudah disepakati .”
(wawancara 27 Juli 2020).
Namun demikian, kerjasama yang bersifat B
to B ( business to busines s), atau P to P
(person to person) tersebut dipandang tidak
dapat dilakukan karena status non-
government tersebut, sebagaimana
disampaikan Sukoso, Kepala BPJPH
(wawancara 27 Juli 2020).

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
121

Ketiga, peluang membangun kesepakatan
MRA dapat disusun berdasarkan peluang
yang kita ciptakan sendiri di luar soal
perdagangan produk halal, yakni
penyediaan tenaga kerja terlatih yang
mendukung industri halal di luar negeri,
seperti: pengiriman tenaga juru sembe lih
halal (juleha), penyelia halal, atau auditor
halal. Usulan ini disampaikan Sukoso,
“...membuka peluang pasar sumber
daya manusia ke luar dan secara
luas, termasuk chef halal. Ketika
ngomong halal restoran halal dan
dapur yang halal, tapi gimana dapur
halal kalau chef -nya bukan chef
halal. Nah, di sini peluang -peluang
ini yang harus kita desain .”
(Wawancara 27 September 2020).
Ide ini disambut baik perwakilan Indonesia
di Polandia, Taufik, yang mengatakan
bahwa peluang adanya ahli -ahli dari
Indonesia yang akan terlibat secara internal
di perusahaan luar negeri, seperti Polandia.
“Karena sekarang saja banyak orang -orang
kita yang bekerja di sektor pemotongan
ayam,” ungkapnya. Gagasan pengiriman
tenaga di bidang halal ke negara -negara di
Eropa ini juga d ipandang peluang baik oleh
Nuradi, pejabat Fungsi Ekonomi di KBRI
Swiss. Dikatakannya,
 “...ya bisa saja itu dianggap satu
peluang, ketika lembaga itu dibentuk
di Swiss, mungkin dia membutuhkan
bantuan dari negara muslim.
Indonesia kan negara muslim
terbesar di dunia ya, populasinya,
mungkin akan dianggap lebih
kompeten di sektor itu, dan mungkin
juga dia meminta bantuan ke kita
untuk membantu prosedur dalam
pemberian sertifikasi halal atau
bagaimana gimana mekanismenya.
Mungkin saja ketika itu dibentuk,
KBRI menawarkan sendiri ke sana,
untuk membantu ya, mengirimkan
orang kesini, untuk membantu unit
itu, itu bisa saja terjadi seperti itu .”
(Wawancara 5 Agustus 2020)
Namun demikian, ide ini disangsikan
perwakilan Indonesia di KBRI Austria, Adi,
yang membayangkan kesulitan penerimaan
pihak Swiss terkait pelatihan teknis halal di
negaranya jika hal itu diadakan. Bagi
Pemerintah Swiss, halal dipandang sebagai
bagian dari urusan agama, dan negara tidak
ikut campur urusan agama yang bersifat
privat tersebut  (Wawancara 5 Agustus
2020).
Tantangan MRA
Ada sejumlah hal yang dapat dikategorikan
sebagai tantangan atas terbangunnya MRA
Sertifikat Halal. Sebagian tantangan itu
bersifat internal di/dari dalam negeri, dan
sebagiannya di/dari luar negeri.

Tantangan internal yang pertama adalah
regulasi pelaksanaan sertifikasi di Indonesia
belum lengkap, yakni terutama terkait belum
adanya regulasi mengenai ketentuan tarif.
Hal ini menyebabkan proses bisnis
sertifikasi halal terkendala. Ratusan
permohonan se rtifikasi yang sudah masuk
ke BPJPH terpaksa tidak dapat diproses
sebagaimana tahapan yang sudah diatur di

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
122

dalam PP dan PMA terkait sertifikasi halal.
Lalu, berdasar pada KMA No. 982 Tahun
2019, yang merupakan kebijakan diskresi,
pengelolaan sementara meng gunakan tarif
dan proses lama --yakni banyak
memerankan LPPOM MUI. Kondisi ini
menyebabkan banyak pihak di luar negeri
(terutama pengusaha dan eksportir)
kebingungan untuk mengikuti alur peraturan
halal di Indonesia tersebut. Kondisi ini pula
yang menjadi tantangan saat nanti kita mau
membangun kesepahaman saling
pengakuan (MRA) dengan pihak lain. Untuk
menjadi catatan, dalam menyusun MRA,
detail klausul atau pasal sangat
diperhatikan. Maka, hal -hal regulatif dan
substantif haruslah benar -benar sudah
kokoh. Ledia Hanifa, m antan Ketua Pokja
RUU Halal DP RI, menyinggung belum soal
belum adanya tarif ini dengan kaitan
birokrasi sebagai tantangan. Dikatakannya,
“(masalah) birokrasi! karena tarif aja nggak
keluar keluar kan, gimana mau maju.”
(Wawancara 14 Agustus 2020).

Kedua, berkaitan dengan yang pertama,
yakni performa dan layanan lembaga
penyelenggara halal di dalam negeri yang
belum optimal. Bukan hanya belum
optimalnya leading sector  dan aktor utama
yakni Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan
Produk Halal (BPJPH) , namun pihak dan
perangkat lainnya, seperti Lembaga
Pemeriksa Halal dan aparat pelayanan di
level frontliner pelayanan halal, yang dalam
hal ini Kasi Urais pada Kanwil Kementerian
Agama Provinsi. Staf pada Kemenag yang
mengurus pendaftaran halal ini bersi fat
sementara karena belum adanya BPJPH di
level provinsi. Kondisi performa internal ini
tentu menjadi tantangan yang akan
berdampak pada kesiapan dalam
membangun MRA. Pelayanan yang bersifat
manual saja, misalnya, mengandaikan
pengusaha pemohon sertifikas i harus
mendatangi kantor Kemenag Provinsi.
Sangat tidak efektif dan meniscayakan ada
biaya transportasi. Akan berbeda jika
pelayanan seutuhnya melalui online, selain
murah dan praktis, juga traceable. Hal ini
diamini Lukmanul Hakim, Direktur LPPOM,
“…menurut saya itu tantangan
dalam proses sertifikasi halal itu
adalah bahwa perusahaan yang
mendaftar ke BPJPH itu harusnya
mereka tahu ke mana setelah itu,
kedua memang pendaftaran dari
BPJPH kepada LPH itu dalam hal ini
LPPOM MUI, dari manual dengan
dokumen fisik kepada dokumen
online yang kita buat dengan
sertifikasi online seri 23000 .”
(Wawancara 27 Juli 2020).

Ketiga, kondisi internal (Pemerintah
Indonesia, atau BPJPH) yang belum bisa
meyakinkan publik luar mengenai tujuan
dan manfaat UU Jaminan Produk Ha lal. UU
yang hanya ada di Indonesia ini lebih
dipandang mempersulit dibanding memberi
kebermanfaatan, misal added value
terhadap produk atau meningkatkan respon

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
123

pasar. Dikatakan oleh Lutfi, perwakilan
SwissCham, serupa Kamar Dagang di
Indonesia, yang menyatakan:
“Kalau kita membicarakan di
pertumbuhan global, selalu
dipertanyakan, kenapa Saudi Arabia
tidak menggunakan sertifikat halal
untuk salah satu syarat masuk?
Juga Malaysia dan sebagainya.
Apakah Indonesia lebih Islamic
daripada mereka? nah ini yang
harus di ini -kan oleh para petinggi -
petinggi kita gitu, sehingga bisa
meyakinkan para duta besar yang
ada di Indonesia ini untuk membawa
konsep ini. Bukan hanya karena
mau mempersulit mereka tapi
karena lebih banyak manfaatnya
pada masyarakat Indonesia. Dan
kalau udah kayak gitu kan
Kementerian Luar Negeri,
Kementerian Perdagangan,
Perindustrian dan sebagainya,
sampai pada para duta besar ini
yang sampai hari ini. Jujur aja kalau
di perusahaan multinational selalu
dipertanyakan, kita ekspor ke Saudi
nggak pe rnah ada persyaratan
sertifikat halal – misalnya
gitu…Malaysia juga nggak ada,
kenapa Indonesia harus pake
sertifikat halal?”  (Wawancara 12
Agustus 2020).

Adapun tantangan keempat adalah soal
kemampuan produksi yang belum setara.
Ketika mau menjalin MRA, kemampuan
produksi kita harus lebih siap atau
setidaknya setara dengan negara lain
tersebut. Jika tidak, alias tidak resiprokal
dan seimbang, maka Indonesia hanya akan
menjadi pasar bagi negara partner.
Disampaikan Taufik, pejabat fungsi ekonomi
pada KBRI Polandia,
“tantangan buat kita adalah
sebenarnya bahwa kita itu hanya
jadi pasar jadi, mereka itu butuh
sertifikasi Halal untuk memasukkan
semua daging -daging mereka ke
Indonesia, itu dari satu sisi ya bisa
jadi tantangan bisa jadi peluang.
Jadi, di kita akan lebih banyak
daging tidak hanya dari Australia
dan New Zealand. Jadi, sertifikat
halal yang kita buat kemudian hanya
menjadi skema untuk mereka
memasukan barangnya ke
Indonesia. Tapi artinya bahwa
substansi kita ingin mendapatkan
daging halal tercapai tapi kemud ian
dari sisi perdagangan, sertifikat Halal
kita belum memiliki kekuatan untuk
offensive artinya memasukkan
barang kesini (Polandia) kan, untuk
memasukkan barang Indonesia ke
Polandia.” (Wawancara 29 Juli
2020).

Hal ini dikuatkan oleh Adi, pejabat fungsi
ekonomi di KBRI Austria, yang menyatakan,
“Apakah dengan mutual recognition
agreement itu untuk G  to G apakah
bisa mencapai kesepakatan
bersama? Kalau kita membuat
gambar bentuk G to G antara Austria
dan Indonesia tapi efeknya malah
meningkatkan ekspor barang Austria
jadi meningkat ke Indonesia, artinya
impor Indonesia lebih banyak itu,
menurut saya kurang seimbang,
kalau MRA itu dengan sesama
negara muslim yang sama -sama
dengan rezim seperti Indonesia,
artinya mensyaratkan sertifikasi itu
harus di sana ju ga mensyaratkan
seperti itu di dalam negeri, dan kita
membuat kerja sama saling
mengakui mereka mempunyai akses
pasar mereka kita juga punya akses
ke pasar mereka, itulah berarti
seimbang, tetapi apabila kita
mengadakan G to G dengan negara
yang tidak meng haruskan halal itu

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
124

diterapkan di negaranya bahkan
tidak mensyaratkan sertifikasi halal
karena sertifikasi halal itu bagi
mereka bukan satu persyaratan
barang itu bisa masuk. Seperti Uni
Eropa mungkin akan lebih condong
ke sistem standar atau TBT dan
SPS-nya, sistem sanitasinya. Nah
dari konteks itu Apakah dengan
MRA halal G to G itu berefek pada
meningkatnya akses Indonesia itu ke
Austria, atau tidak berefek?”
(Wawancara 5 Agustus 2020).

Adapun tantangan yang bersifat eksternal,
yang pertama adalah bahwa di negara lain
tidak ada lembaga yang setara dengan
BPJPH atau Kementerian Agama --yang
mengurus secara khusus halal atau
sertifikasi halal. Disampaikan Andit, Fungsi
Ekonomi di KBRI Jerman,
“...butuh mitra yang setara untuk
penandatangan MRA,  while di
Jerman ini, menurut kedutaan
Jerman, baik kedutaan di Jerman
maupun di Jakarta, Kementerian
Ekonomi disini, tidak ada mitra
setara seperti itu. Kami dari KBRI
sudah berusaha juga muter -muter,
mencari akal, apa yang bisa
disetarakan, hingga saat ini juga kita
belum dapat respon positif dari
pemerintah Jerman karena kita
coba. Saya pribadi coba, muter
misalnya ke registrasi perusahaan,
bisa nggak disamakan dengan
lembaga yang melakukan registrasi
GMBH-nya. Ternyata menurut
hukum setempat, registrasi
dilakukan oleh pengadilan, jadi
susah, oke jadi nggak bisa. Jadi,
dengan siapa? Dengan Kementerian
Ekonomi. Menurut Kementerian
Ekonomi, mereka tidak melakukan
tataran kebijakan terhadap produk
halal secara spesifik. Mungkin
secara hubungan ekonomi iya, t api
tidak melakukan hubungan halnya
secara spesifik. Jadi mereka tidak
nyaman. Nah, mungkin hal ini yang
menjadi tantangan, khususnya bagi
RI-Jerman karena dari Kepala
BPJPH sendiri kan, atau amanat dari
Undang-undang sendiri kan harus
ada MRA -nya. Jadi in i PR yang
outstanding juga. Bagaimana kita
bisa proceed MRA ini, bisa goal-lah
istilahnya gitu. Itu yang kita hadapi,
jadi agak susah ya, mencari mitra
yang setara di level pemerintah
khususnya, kalau misalnya mitranya
conceal. Komunitas setempat, itu
pun sangat segmented. Kita mau
mitra yang mana? Mitra organisasi
Turki yang ada disini atau mau mitra
organisasi? Karena tidak ada juga
mitra organisasi “MUI” yang ada di
Jerman.” (Wawancara 6 Agustus
2020).

Kedua, halal dipersepsi oleh sebagian
negara sebaga i technical barrier to trade
(TBT). UU 33/2014 tentang JPH telah
diangkat 13 (tiga belas) kali pada sesi
perdagangan khusus di WTO ( World Trade
Organization) oleh Australia, Brasil,
Selandia Baru, Amerika Serikat, Kanada,
Uni Eropa, dan Taiwan. Negara-negara
tersebut meminta Indonesia untuk
mempertimbangkan kembali
pendekatannya dengan tetap menjadikan
sertifikasi dan label halal bersifat sukarela
serta transparansi penerapan UU JPH.

UU JPH pertama kali diangkat pada
Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade
(TBT) WTO pada bulan Juni 2016. Delegasi
AS memahami tujuan UU JPH untuk

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
125

menjamin produk halal bagi konsumen
Indonesia dan menyatakan komitmen AS
untuk bekerja sama dengan Indonesia
untuk memastikan bahwa tujuan ini tercapai
tanpa menciptakan hambatan perdagangan
yang tidak perlu. Sementara itu, Selandia
Baru mencatat beberapa masalah dalam
rancangan peraturan turunan UU JPH yang
masih belum jelas. Sementara Uni Eropa
mengutarakan keprihatinan yang diangkat
oleh AS dan Selandia Baru bahwa
sertifikasi halal wajib akan menyiratkan
biaya tambahan yang signifikan bagi para
pelaku ekonomi. UE menilai bahwa
kurangnya transparansi dalam menerapkan
aturan dan pendekatan yang terfragmentasi
dalam penerapan UU JPH akan
menciptakan ketidakpastian. Adapun
Australia mendesak Indonesia untuk
mematuhi kewajiban perdagangan
internasional dan menotifikasi rancangan
peraturan turunan UU JPH kepada WTO.

Pada sidang lanjutan Komite TBT WTO
bulan November 2016, AS menyampaikan
kekhawatiran bahwa persyaratan halal yang
rumit dan duplikasi. AS juga mengkritik
ketidakjelasan persyaratan registrasi untuk
produk lokal. AS dan Selandia Baru
meminta agar draf peraturan pelaksana UU
JPH diberitahukan kepada WTO sebelum
disahkan untuk memberikan waktu bagi
komentar dari para pemangku kepentingan
dan agar komentar tersebut
dipertimbangkan oleh Indonesia. UE menilai
bahwa kurangnya transparansi dalam
menerapkan aturan dan pendekatan yang
terfragmentasi menciptakan ketidakpastian.
Australia menyuarakan keprihatinan tentang
kemungkinan hambatan perdagangan
akibat UU JPH. Australia menyambut baik
penundaan penerapan regulasi hingga
November 2019 dan mengingatkan
Indonesia tentang kewajiban transparansi
berdasarkan Perjanjian TBT.

UU JPH kembali dipermasalahkan pada
Komite TBT WTO pada Maret 2017. AS dan
Australia kembali menyuarakan
keprihatinan aspirasi sektor swasta
internasional bahwa pewajiban label halal
dapat membatasi akses ke produk secara
signifikan. Tindakan ini juga dapat
menimbulkan beban yang besar bagi UKM
internasional dan Indonesia serta
mengganggu manufaktur dan ekspor
Indonesia. Uni Eropa menegaskan kembali
keprihatinan serius bahwa tidak
mengizinkan produk yang tidak bersertifikat
halal adalah sama dengan larangan total
impor produk non -halal. UE mengingatkan
Indonesia terikat pada aturan WTO yang
melarang menghambat perdagangan,
prinsip non-diskriminasi, serta transparansi.
Dengan menjaga sertifikasi dan pelabelan
halal secara sukarela, ini akan mengurangi
pembatasan perdagangan dan sejalan
dengan tujuan TBT. UE me minta Indonesia

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
126

memberitahukan setiap draf aturan
pelaksana ke WTO.

Karena Indonesia dinilai belum menjawab
dengan baik pertanyaan -pertanyaan yang
diangkat dalam Komite WTO tentang TBT
pada bulan Juni dan November 2017 .
Kekecewaan terhadap Indonesia mulai
meningkat pada sidang Committee on TBT
WTO pada Maret 2018 , Juni 2018 ,
November 2018, Maret 2019, dan Juni
2019.
Selama Komite WTO tentang TBT pada
Maret dan Juni 2019, Indonesia merespon
dengan fasih dan baik dengan menjabarkan
Mutual Recognition Arrange ments (MRA)
untuk skema sertifikasi halal guna
mengurangi hambatan teknis yang tidak
perlu. Indonesia berkomitmen penuh untuk
menerapkan prinsip saling pengakuan, dan
proses penerimaan sertifikasi dilakukan
oleh lembaga sertifikasi di luar Indonesia
dengan syarat lembaga sertifikasi di luar
Indonesia baik diakreditasi oleh KAN
(Komite Akreditasi Nasional) atau telah
menandatangani MoU atau MRA dengan
Pemerintah Indonesia. Produk yang
mengandung bahan non halal tetap dapat
beredar, masuk, dan diperdagangkan di
Indonesia dengan mencantumkan informasi
non halal sesuai dengan ketentuan Badan
Pengawas Obat dan Makanan. Indonesia
meyakinkan negara anggota WTO bahwa
penerapan UU JPH tidak akan membatasi
kebebasan masyarakat untuk memilih
produk yang diinginkan.

Komite TBT WTO pada November 2019
menandai momen penting dalam
pembahasan halal di WTO karena digelar
sebulan setelah UU JPH diberlakukan pada
17 Oktober 2019 dan dihadiri langsung oleh
Kepala BPJPH. Taiwan bergabung dengan
AS, Australia, Brasil, Selandia Ba ru,
Kanada, dan UE untuk menyampaikan
keprihatinan tentang penerapan UU JPH di
Indonesia.

Kanada meninjau sertifikasi dan proses
pengakuan organisasi sertifikasi halal asing
masih kurang dan tetap tidak jelas. Kanada
dan Australia mendorong Indonesia untu k
berkonsultasi dan memberikan informasi
kepada mitra dagang untuk memastikan
bahwa tindakan tersebut tidak membatasi
perdagangan secara berlebihan.

Sedangkan Taiwan meminta Indonesia
menjelaskan: prosedur sertifikasi; tata cara
saling pengakuan lembaga s ertifikasi halal
asing; perbedaan antara spesifikasi
sebelumnya dan yang baru; dan, apakah
lembaga asing yang telah bekerja sama
dengan LPPOM MUI otomatis disetujui oleh
BPJPH. Sementara, Selandia Baru dan
Brazil meminta klarifikasi tentang ruang
lingkup i stilah “produk non -halal” dan
bagaimana persyaratan dan pelabelan akan

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
127

dikelola. Selandia Baru mengucapkan
terima kasih kepada Indonesia telah
memberikan notifikasi kepada WTO tentang
draft Peraturan Menteri Agama tentang
Penyelenggaraan Jaminan Produk Hal al
pada 14 Oktober 2019.

Indonesia menyampaikan notifikasi kepada
WTO perihal Peraturan Menteri Agama
dimaksud yang mengatur sistem jaminan
halal sebagai berikut: (i) cakupan produk;
(ii) masa transisi dan waktu yang
diberlakukan yang disesuaikan dengan
cakupan produk; (iii) pencantuman label
halal dan informasi produk non-halal; (iv)
sistem penilaian kesesuaian halal dan
pengaturan saling pengakuan; (v) ketentuan
pendaftaran untuk sertifikat halal; dan, (vi)
mekanisme produk bersertifikat halal
selama masa transisi.

Selain UU JPH, sistem jaminan halal
Indonesia juga dipermasalahkan pada
sidang-sidang lain yang membahas
Peraturan Menteri Pertanian Indonesia
tentang Impor Karkas, Daging dan / atau
Produk Daging Olahan sebanyak empat
sesi antara Maret 2015 dan Juni 2016.

Sistem jaminan halal Indonesia juga
diadukan oleh Brazil pada sidang khusus
mengenai Impor Daging dan Produk Ayam
(DS484). Dalam kasus ini, Brasil menuduh
Indonesia melanggar beberapa aturan
GATT/WTO pada impor daging ayam dan
produk ayam dari Brasil. Beberapa larangan
impor tersebut tertuang dalam berbagai
regulasi Indonesia tentang persyaratan
pemotongan dan pelabelan halal untuk
daging ayam dan produk ayam impor. Lebih
khusus lagi, peraturan tersebut mengatur
pengawasan dan penerapan persy aratan
pemotongan dan pelabelan halal. Menurut
Brasil pengawasan dan penerapan
persyaratan untuk produk ayam impor lebih
ketat daripada yang diterapkan pada
produksi dalam negeri di Indonesia.

Keputusan Panel Badan Penyelesaian
Sengketa ( Dispute Settlement Body ) WTO
memutuskan bahwa Indonesia bersalah dan
diwajibkan untuk merevisi aturan impor
unggas dan produknya (Peraturan Menteri
Pertanian dan Menteri Perdagangan).
Namun, Indonesia dinyatakan tidak
melakukan diskriminasi terhadap ayam
impor dalam menegakkan persyaratan label
halal. Ahamat & Rahman (2018)
menyatakan bahwa kasus Indonesia -
Produk Ayam telah mengangkat isu halal
pada perdagangan dunia dan perhatian
besar WTO pada isu halal.

Ketiga, halal masih kerap dipandang
sebagai instrumen agama, dibanding
instrumen perdagangan , sehingga
menjadikannya sulit dikomunikasikan
dengan negara pihak yang menempatkan

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
128

agama berjarak dengan urusan negara .
Dikatakan Doni, pejabat di Kementerian
Perdagangan RI,
“…ini itu butuh waktu yang panjang
untuk bisa meyakinkan bahwa
sertifikasi ini merupakan instrumen
perdagangan…bukan instrumen
agama…itu yang memang nggak
mudah. Dan terus terangnya ya,
memang tantangan ini akan luar
biasa sulit, jangankan kita bicara
soal sertifikasi halal gitu ya,
sertifikasi y ang lain aja yang punya
Indonesia, itu setengah mati kita
bisa minta diakui di Uni Eropa .”
(Wawancara 3 Agustus 2020).

Dan keempat, di beberapa negara Eropa
ada kelompok ekstrim kanan yang sangat
anti dengan isu halal, yang dipandang
ekspresi agama, meski  hal ini dirasa tidak
signifikan. Dikatakan Adi, perwakilan di
KBRI Denmark, “Di Austria ada organisasi
extreme kanan yang ada resistansinya
terhadap label halal, namun dikatakan tidak
terlalu signifikan”  (Wawancara 11 Agustus
2020).

Dari paparan di atas  dapat diringkaskan
sbb:
Potensi
MRA
1. Tren total nilai perdagangan
yang terus meningkat di
kelima negara
2. Komoditas unggulan dari
negara objek penelitian
memerlukan sertifikasi halal
antara lain makanan,
kosmetik, dan farmasi
3. Kerja sama halal dapat
diupayakan dengan
pendekatan multilateral yaitu
UE dan EFTA
4. Isu halal dapat diangkat pada
mekanisme bilateral dalam
Dialog Lintas Agama di
masing-masing negara

Peluang
MRA
1. Indonesia menjadi pasar
barang-halal negara-negara di
Eropa tersebut, spt daging,
susu, dan coklat., sehingga
mendorong mereka untuk
melakukan kerjasama
perdagangan dengan
Indonesia
2. Secara informal (non-
governmental scheme )
Indonesia telah memiliki
kerjasama pengakuan halal
dengan 45 lembaga sertifikasi
halal luar negeri di 26 negara,
yakni berupa 45 Approved
Halal Certification Bodies list
pada LPPOM MUI.
3. Peluang semakin besar
dengan cara membuka
peluang penyediaan tenaga
kerja di bidang halal (seperti
juru sembelih halal, penyelia
halal, dsb)

Tantangan
MRA
(Internal)
1. Regulasi pelak sanaan
sertifikasi di Indonesia belum
lengkap, yakni terutama terkait
belum adanya regulasi
mengenai ketentuan tarif.
2. Performa dan layanan
lembaga penyelenggara halal
di dalam negeri yang belum
optimal. Bukan hanya BPJPH,
tetapi suprastruktur lainnya,
seperti BPJPH daerah atau
pihak khusus tertentu.
3. Kondisi internal (Pemerintah
Indonesia, atau BPJPH)
belum bisa meyakinkan publik
luar mengenai tujuan dan
manfaat UU Jaminan Produk
Halal.
4. Kemampuan produksi yang
belum setara antara Indonesia
dengan luar neger i, baik
kualitas maupun kuantitasnya.

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
129

Tantangan
MRA
(eksternal)
1. Di negara -negara Eropa tidak
ada lembaga yang setara
dengan BPJPH atau
Kementerian Agama --yang
mengurus khusus masalah
halal.
2. Halal dipersepsi oleh
sebagian negara sebagai TBT
(technical barrier to trade),
sehingga mereka mengangkat
soal UU JPH di sidang WTO
berkali-kali.
3. Halal masih kerap dipandang
sebagai instrumen agama,
dibanding instrumen
perdagangan. Di banyak
negara di Eropa menjadi
kendala untuk mengangkat isu
ini di level negara—yang
notabene sekuler.

Studi ini menemukan bahwa hukum halal
Indonesia tidak hanya memicu dinamika
sesi dan panel WTO tetapi juga
meningkatkan berbagai kekhawatiran dari
bisnis di negara-negara pengimpor di Eropa.
Pada pertemuan Joint Economic and Trade
Commission (JETC) antara Indonesia dan
Swiss pada 15 Juli 2019, para pelaku bisnis
di negara -negara Eropa memahami
kewenangan Indonesia untuk memastikan
ketersediaan produk halal di negara
mayoritas Muslim tersebut. Namun, para
pelaku bisnis asing m embutuhkan
transparansi dan informasi yang jelas untuk
prosedur sertifikasi halal di bawah rezim UU
JPH. Asosiasi bisnis Swiss di Indonesia,
SwissCham, melontarkan pertanyaan terkait
ketatnya regulasi halal di Indonesia
dibanding di Arab Saudi, Malaysia, d an
negara mayoritas Muslim lainnya. Untuk itu,
SwissCham meminta pemerintah Indonesia
membuka saluran  komunikasi seluas -
luasnya untuk menjawab kekhawatiran
terkait bisnis dalam sertifikasi halal.

Selain menjadi isu pada perdagangan
internasional, UU JPH j uga mengalami
tantangan pelaksanaan kerja sama
internasional dalam hal ketiadaan lembaga
pemerintah yang menangani agama.
Meskipun demikian, semua negara objek
penelitian melihat isu halal bukan sebagai
isu agama semata. Sebagian besar negara
Eropa memanda ng masalah halal sebagai
masalah perdagangan internasional, seperti
Polandia (di bawah Kementerian
Pembangunan Ekonomi), Austria (di bawah
Kementerian Digital dan Ekonomi), dan
Swiss (Sekretariat Kerja Sama Ekonomi
SECO). Sementara itu, Denmark melihat
masalah halal lebih pada masalah
kesejahteraan hewan dan ditangani oleh
lembaga hybrid Public -Private Partnership
(PPP), yaitu Danish Agriculture and Food
Council (DAFC). Dengan kata lain, industri
halal dapa dikatakan memprovokasi
penataan kelembagaan di neg ara-negara
Eropa karena berbagai alasan -alasan
tersebut.

Selanjutnya, untuk melengkapi data dasar
sebagai bahan analisis, berikut profil negara
dan data terkait halal di lima negara Eropa
yang dikaji oleh riset ini (Tabel 1).

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021

Tabel 1 : Profil 5 (lima) negara Eropa terkait halal
Analisis Intermestik UU JPH
Dari paparan temuan penelitian pada bab
sebelumnya, data dapat dianalisis dengan
pendekatan intermestik ( international-
domestic approach). Bahwa ada keterkaitan
antara sistem politik dalam negeri dan
implikasinya terhadap urusan internasional.
Secara konvensional, politik luar negeri
merupakan proyeksi dari politik domestik.
Namun perkembangan studi hubungan
internasional menemukan bahwa a spek
domestik dan internasional semakin terjalin
dan saling mempengaruhi satu sama lain
(intermestik).

Penelitian ini menemukan bahwa UU JPH
memiliki faktor intermestik yang signifikan
dengan menunjukkan keterkaitan pengaruh
antara dinamika domestik dan internasional.

Hal ini ditunjukkan dengan ketidakjelasan
proses sertifikasi halal Indonesia yang
sangat mempengaruhi perdagangan dan
bisnis internasional di banyak negara.

Pada saat yang sama, UU JPH secara
khusus diangkat pada 13 kali sidang -sidang
Komite TBT di WTO. Selain itu, kasus
sengketa impor ayam Brasil vs Indonesia di
WTO juga menggambarkan keprihatinan
internasional yang besar terhadap sertifikasi
halal Indonesia, bahkan beberapa tindakan
menunjukkan hasrat mengintervensi
kebijakan halal di Indonesia.
Pada era globalisasi ini, faktor intermestik
sertifikasi halal perlu disadari oleh para
pemangku kebijakan di dalam negeri.
Sehingga produk jaminan halal dan
sertifikasi bisa memenangkan “ two-level
game” pada aras domestik dan
internasional sekaligus.
Analisis SWOT MRA
Untuk menimbang kekuatan, kelemahan,
peluang dan tantangan, dilakukan analisis
SWOT. Yakni mengelompokkan berbagai
fakta kondisi pada empat bilah: kekuatan
dan kesempatan (yang b ersifat positif bagi
terbangunnya MRA), dan kelemahan serta

internal
Strengths
1. Indonesia pasar produk halal
yang sangat besar (populasi
muslim Indonesia 87%)
2. Tren total nilai perdagangan yang
terus meningkat di kelima negara
3. Secara existing sudah ada 45
LHLN yang bekerjasama saling
mengakui, meski statusnya P to

4. Indonesia memiliki surplus
tenaga kerja terlatih di bidang
halal, seperti juleha, penyelia

Weaknesses
1. Regulasi masih belum lengkap
2. Performa dan kinerja lembaga

3. Pihak dalam negeri belum bisa meyakinkan
pihak di luar negeri soal manfaat UU JPH
4. Kemampuan produksi masih kalah kualitas

Opportunities
1. Komoditas unggulan dari negara
objek penelitian memerlukan
sertifikasi halal antara lain
makanan, kosmetik, dan farmasi
2. Kerja sama halal dapat
diupayakan dengan pendekatan
multilateral yaitu UE dan EFTA
3. Isu halal dapat diangkat pada
mekanisme bilateral dalam Dialog

negara
Threats
1. Tidak ada mitra setara dengan
BPJPH/Kemenag, sehingga kerjasama
sulit dilakukan
2. Halal dipandang oleh sebagian negara
sebagai TBT (technical barrier to trade)
3. Halal dipandang sebagai isu agama
dibanding perdagangan. Padahal banyak
negara di Eropa bercorak sekuler (yang
membatasi mengurus isu agama).

Tabel 2 : Analisis SWOT MRA

tantangan (yang mengendala terbangunnya
MRA).
Dari pemetaan kekuatan, kelemahan,
peluang dan hambatan tersebut, dapat
diupayakan bagaimana kekuatan dan
kesempatan dapat menutupi atau
mengurangi kelemahan dan tantangan yang
dihadapi. Misalnya, ketika menyadari belum
bisa mengimbangi kualitas dan kuanti tas
produk, Indonesia dapat mengembangkan
penguatan SDM di bidang halal —yang hal
ini tidak dimiliki negara -negara minoritas
muslim di Eropa tersebut. Para ustaz atau
tenaga halal terlatih dikirim ke negara -
negara Eropa untuk menjadi mentor,
supervisor, ata u tenaga penjamin halal di
LHLN atau perusahaan.

Contoh lain, ketika isu halal terlalu
dipersepsi sebagai agama an sich  atau
kurang dipahami sebagai instrumen
perdagangan, mekanisme dialog lintas
agama dapat dikembangkan sebagai
wahana untuk mengomunikas ikan isu halal
ini. Persisnya, dalam suatu sesi Dialog
Lintas Agama diagendakan untuk
membicarakan sub tema “ Religion and
Bussiness," misalnya, yang mendiskusikan
dinamika implementasi isu halal di dalam
percaturan hubungan dan perdagangan
global.

KESIMPULAN DAN REKOMENDASI
Kesimpulan
Penelitian ini menemukan bahwa Mutual
Recognition Agreement  (MRA) dalam
bidang halal merupakan bentuk kerja sama
yang belum pernah dikenal dan belum
pernah terjalin antara Indonesia dengan
negara/pihak manapun.

Sejauh ini belum ada MRA halal dengan
negara lain, karena berbagai kelemahan
internal dan tantangan eksternal masih lebih
besar dari optimalisasi potensi yang dimiliki.
Upaya membangun ke arah MRA sudah
dilakukan, meski masih belum menunjukkan
hasil.

Peluang, potensi, dan tantangan kerja sama
saling pengakuan sertifikat halal di negara -
negara kawasan Eropa, memiliki derajat
yang sama besar. Potensi dan peluangnya
seimbang dengan tantangan atau hambatan
yang dihadapi. Hal itu ditunjukkan dengan
sangat banyak negara ti dak memiliki
lembaga pemerintah yang menangani isu
halal untuk menjalin kerja saja G -to-G
dengan Indonesia. Negara -negara
dimaksud bahkan tidak memiliki kebijakan
yang kompeten dalam isu halal. Sedangkan
untuk menjalin MRA antara LHLN dengan
BPJPH, kerja s ama G -to-G dalam bidang
halal menjadi elemen kunci disamping
sejumlah persyaratan teknis proses
sertifikasi yang disepakati bersama.

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
133

Dengan kata lain, masa depan MRA halal
sangat ditentukan oleh dinamika faktor
domestik dan internasional yang saling
berkelindan.
Rekomendasi
Untuk mewujudkan MRA, perlu pendekatan
komprehensif non -keagamaan dalam
pengembangan kerja sama sertifikasi halal
Indonesia-Eropa. Kerja sama internasional
JPH dapat dilakukan melalui pendekatan
bilateral, regional, dan multilateral. Pa da
fase ini dibutuhkan peran strategis
Kementerian Luar Negeri, Kementerian
Perdagangan, dan perwakilan RI di luar
negeri.

Kewibawaan BPJPH dalam mewujudkan
jaminan halal nasional yang kokoh
merupakan pondasi dari keberhasilan
proses membangun MRA. Peneli tian ini
merekomendasikan jaminan produk halal
nasional perlu ditumbuhkembangkan dalam
eksosistem global yang mendukung. Maka
dari itu, perlu diupayakan untuk
mewujudkan global halal system guna
melindungi jaminan produk halal nasional.
Pada saat yang bersamaan, jaminan produk
halal nasional menjadi pondasi bagi global
halal system.

Mewujudkan simbiosis mutualisme antara
faktor internasional dan domestik tersebut
perlu ditunjang dengan pilar-pilar kerja
sama, yaitu (1) promosi halal dan sertifikasi
halal, (2) pengembangan SDM halal, (3)
penelitian dan pengembangan integral dan
berkelanjutan. Tiga pilar itu dapat ditegakan
melalui MoU G -to-G baik secara bilateral,
regional, maupun multilateral.
Pilar-pilar kerja sama dimaksud akan
mengarah pada MRA sertifikasi halal. MRA
sertifikasi halal akan lebih mudah terjalin
manakala ditopang oleh pilar kerja sama
yang telah tegak pada fase kerja sama
sebelumnya. Mengupayakan MRA
sertifikasi halal tanpa ditopang oleh pondasi
jaminan produk halal nasional yang kuat
dan pilar kerja sama yang kokoh adalah
suatu upaya yang melompati ketertiban
proses.

Proses pembangunan global halal system
yang ditopang oleh sistem jaminan produk
halal nasional dan pila r-pilar kerja sama
diilustrasikan melalui skema di bawah ini.

KLAIM WILAYAH PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA ATAS
LAUT CHINA SELATAN DAN “21ST CENTURY MARITIME SILK
ROAD”: Laut China Selatan sebagai “Flashpoint” Baru di
Asia Tenggara

Sutadi, SH., MA
Pengamat Hubungan Internasional

Abstrak
People’s Republic of China (China) ingin mewujudkan konsep BRI ( Belt and Road Initiative ) yang akan
menghubungkan China dengan Eropa menggunakan jalur laut yang disebut dengan “21st Century
Maritime Silk Road” yang bermula di Laut China Selatan (LCS) dan berujung di Eropa . Dalam kaitan itu,
China memandang bahwa LCS harus “dimiliki ” berdasarkan konsep nine-dash line yang sejatinya
bertentangan dengan Konvensi PBB tentang Hukum Laut Internasional 1982 (UN Convention on the Law
of the Sea/ UNCLOS, 1982). Meskipun demikian, China tetap “ menduduki” pulau -pulau di LCS secara
sistematis dan konsisten dengan dukungan militer. Memperhatikan perilaku China, diperkirakan bahwa
China nantinya akan membawa klaim wilayahnya atas LCS ke ICJ ( International Court of Justice ) di Den
Haag dengan konsep effective occupation (pendudukan efektif) atas pulau -pulau tersebut. Strategi China
itu didasarkan pada fakta bahwa ICJ telah menggunakan prinsip tersebut ketika memenangkan Malaysia
dalam sengketa kepemilikan atas Pulau Ligitan dan Pulau Sipadan antara In donesia dan Malaysia
(2002).
Klaim China di LCS ditentang Amerika Serikat yang tidak ingin kepentingannya atas  freedom of
navigation di LCS dihambat oleh China. Amerika Serikat bahkan membentuk AUKUS untuk menghadapi
China.
Perbedaan kepentingan antara Ame rika Serikat dan China berpotensi menjadikan LCS sebagai
flashpoint baru di Asia Tenggara. Dalam kaitan ini maka ASEAN perlu mengambil inisiatif untuk
mencegah terjadinya konflik terbuka di LCS.

Kata kunci: 21st Century Maritime Silk Road , Laut China Sela tan, effective occupation , freedom of
navigation, AUKUS, ASEAN

PENDAHULUAN
Presiden China, Xi Jinping dalam kunjungan
resminya ke Indonesia, telah
menyampaikan pidato di Parlemen
Indonesia pada tanggal 2 Oktober 2013
yang memperkenalkan konsep “21st Century
Maritime Silk Road”. Pidato tersebut
ditujukan kepada Indonesia dan negara -
negara anggota ASEAN. Konsep ini
merupakan bagian dari konsep Belt and
Road Initiative (BRI) yang ditargetkan
terwujud pada tahun 2049 (Catatan: tahun
2049 bertepatan dengan peringatan dan
perayaan 100 tahun berdirinya People’s
Republic of China yang didirikan pada
tanggal 1 Oktober 1949).
Dalam konsep “21st Century Maritime Silk
Road”, China ing in mengembangkan “jalur
laut” untuk mengimplementasikan konsep
BRI. Wilayah yang masuk dalam “21st

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
137

Century Maritime Silk Road” ialah Laut
China Selatan (LCS) , Selat Malaka,
Samudera Hindia, Teluk Aden, Selat Bab -
el-Mandeb, Djibouti, Laut Merah, Terusan
Suez, Laut Mediterrania dan berakhir di
Eropa.
Dalam konteks LCS, terdapat klaim wilayah
dari China, beberapa negara ASEAN
(Brunei, Malaysia, Philipina dan Vietnam)
serta Taiwan. Indonesia yang tidak
mempunyai klaim wilayah atas LCS juga
telah mengalami gangg uan dari China di
wilayah perairan dekat Pulau Natuna.
Khusus tentang China, klaim China
didasarkan pada nine-dash line  yang
bertentangan dengan Konvensi PBB
tentang Hukum Laut Internasional 1982 (UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea/UNCLOS,
1982). Perilak u China yang mengabaikan
UNCLOS 1982, berpotensi memicu konflik
terbuka di LCS. Perilaku China tersebut
telah “memancing” terbentuknya
“persekutuan” baru AUKUS (Australia, the
United Kingdom, and the United States)
pada September 2021 yang untuk masa ke
depan akan menjadi “penentang utama”
hegemony China di Asia Tenggara dan
ambisi China untuk “memiliki” LCS.
Dalam tulisan ini, akan dibahas klaim
wilayah China untuk “memiliki” LCS dan
kaitannya dengan konsep “21st Century
Maritime Silk Road”. Klaim China in i perlu
dicermati mengingat implikasinya yang luas.
China sebagai negara terkuat secara
ekonomi dan militer di Asia Tenggara dan
Asia Timur, sangat memahami bahwa
keinginannya untuk “memiliki” LCS – yang
terkait erat dengan konsep “21st Century
Maritime Ro ad” – tidak akan menghadapi
hambatan berarti dari negara kawasan.
Menurut penulis, China sudah mempunyai
“road map” untuk “memiliki” LCS dengan
memanfaatkan sumber daya yang ada,
seperti ekonomi dan kekuatan militernya.
China juga sudah membuktikan bahwa
China tidak ragu -ragu untuk menggunakan
kekuatan militernya, misalnya dengan
mendirikan pos -pos militer di pulau -pulau
bermasalah di LCS, mengirim angkatan laut
ke LCS atau mengirim “coast guard” yang
wilayah operasinya jauh dari daratan China.
Apabila ter jadi konflik terbuka di LCS –
utamanya antara China melawan AS (dan
sekutunya) – maka ASEAN akan
mengalami kerugian langsung akibat konflik
tersebut. Untuk mencegah konflik terbuka di
LCS, maka ASEAN perlu untuk lebih aktif
mengambil berbagai langkah diplo matik
yang diperlukan. Jika perilaku China di LCS
tidak dihentikan sejak sekarang, maka di
masa depan akan sulit untuk meminta
China meninggalkan LCS yang sudah
“terlanjur diduduki”, meskipun cara -cara
yang digunakan China adalah illegal.

Untuk membahas t opik ini, penulis
menggunakan pendekatan geopolitik dan
geostrategi, ekonomi, militer, sejarah dan
hukum internasional. Penulis berpandangan
bahwa cara pendekatan tersebut selain
dapat menganalisa motivasi China di LCS,
juga dapat “memperkirakan” kemungkin an
langkah China ke depan dalam upayanya
untuk “memiliki” LCS.

GEOPOLITIK, GEOSTRATEGI DAN
PENGUASAAN LAUT
Untuk membahas “keinginan” China
mewujudkan “21st Century Maritime Road”
dan posisi strategis LCS bagi China,
disampaikan pengertian geopolitik dan
geostrategi yang dikaitkan dengan
pandangan Laksamana Muda Alfred Thayer
Mahan dari Amerika Serikat (AS) tentang
konsep “penguasaan laut.”
Geopolitik
Menurut Graham Evans dan Jeffrey
Newnham, geopolitik ialah:
“A method of foreign policy analysis
which seeks to understand, explain
and predict international political
behavior primarily in terms of
geographical variables, such as
location, size, climate, topography,
demography, natural resources and
technological development and
potential. Political identity and action
is thus seen to be (more or less)
determined by geography.”1
Geostrategi
Pengertian strategi menurut Colin S. Gray
ialah:
“Strategy is the product of dialogue
between policy and military power”.2
Selanjutnya, Colin S. Gray juga
menyampaikan keterkaitan antara geografi
dan strategi, yaitu:
“Geography is an integral element or
dimension of strategy, along with
society, culture, ethics, organization
(defence and force planning),
information, and intelligence,
technology, and the rest.”3
Penguasaan laut
Laksamana Muda Alfred Thayer Mahan
(1840-1914), adalah perwira tinggi
Angkatan Laut Amerika Serikat, yang
mengedepankan konsep “penguasaan laut”
dikaitkan dengan kepentingan ekonomi,
yang secara ringkas ialah:4
1) Maritime commerce was essential to
the economic prosperity of a great
power.

2) The best means of protecting one’s
own trade while interdicting the
enemy’s was to deploy a fleet
battleships capable of maintaining
naval supremacy, the corollary of
which was that a commerce -raiding
strategy execu ted by cruisers was
incapable of inflicting decisive injury.
3) A nation naval supremacy could
defeat a country that was militarily
pre-eminent.
Implementasi pandangan itu dapat dilihat
dari keberadaan 7 (tujuh) armada kapal
perang AS dengan berbagai
kelengkapannya di berbagai penjuru dunia.
Penggelaran armada dan pasukan di
berbagai belahan dunia ini menunjukkan
keseriusan dan kesiapan AS untuk
sewaktu-waktu menggunakan kekuatan
angkatan lautnya untuk mempertahankan
kepentingan AS.
Dalam konteks klaim  wilayah China atas
LCS, maka tampak jelas bahwa China juga
“ingin mengikuti” langkah AS untuk
memperkuat angkatan lautnya.

ANALISA
Road map  China dalam upaya memiliki
LCS dan terwujudnya “21st Century
Maritime Silk Road”
Jika mencermati kiprah China unt uk
“memiliki” LCS, maka tampaknya China
sudah memiliki “Road Map” untuk
menjadikan LCS sebagai bagian yang tidak
terpisahkan dari upaya mewujudkan “21st
Century Maritime Silk Road”. “Road Map”
tersebut secara ringkas dapat digambarkan
sebagai berikut:
1. Konsep nine-dash line sebagai dasar
klaim wilayah China atas LCS.
Seperti diketahui, klaim China atas
kepemilikan LCS didasarkan pada nine-
dash line dan klaim sejarah bahwa China
sudah sejak lama melakukan berbagai
kegiatan seperti penangkapan ikan dan lain-
lain.
Klaim China atas LCS dengan “nine-dash
line” telah “dipersiapkan” China sejak tahun
1929 yaitu pada saat China memerintahkan
para pembuat petanya (cartographers)
untuk menggunakan peta -peta pelayaran
tua milik Inggris untuk “membuat” peta
tentang perbatasan negara China, termasuk
“sembilan-garis-terputus (nine-dash line) ”
yang meliputi seluruh LCS dan wilayah
udara di atasnya. Perkembangan
selanjutnya, pada tahun 2013 China
menambah garis ke sepuluh sehingga
menjadi “ten-dash line” yang memasukkan
Taiwan sebagai “bagian” dari China. China

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021

juga mengklaim semua wilayah air, seluruh
seabed dan airspace di atasnya.5
2. Konsep “21st Century Maritime Silk
Road”
Presiden Xi Jinping dalam kunjungan resmi
ke Indonesia, telah menyampaikan pidato di
Parlemen Indonesia, pada tanggal 2
Oktober 2013 yang ditujukan kepada
Indonesia dan ASEAN, dengan isi antara
lain:6
1) China is ready to open itself wider to
ASEAN countries on the basis  of
equality and mutual benefit to enable
ASEAN countries to benefit more from
China’s development. China is ready to
upgrade the China – ASEAN Free
Trade Area and strive to expand two -
way trade to one trillion US dollars by
2020.
2) China is committed to gre ater
connectivity with ASEAN countries.
China will propose the establishment of
an Asian infrastructure investment bank
that would give priority to ASEAN
countries’ needs.

6 Untuk isi pidato Presiden Xi Jinping di Parlemen
Indonesia selengkapnya dapat dilihat di: asean-china-
center.org/English/2013-10/c_133062675.htm

3) Southeast Asia has since ancient times
been an important hub along the
ancient Maritime Silk Road. China will
strengthen maritime cooperation with
ASEAN countries to make good use of
the China – ASEAN Maritime
Cooperation Fund set up by the
Chinese government and vigorously
develop maritime partnership in a joint
effort to build the  Maritime Silk Road
of the 21st century.*
Dalam pembentukan “21st Century Maritime
Silk Road”, China mempunyai komitmen
membentuk bank yang menyediakan “dana”
untuk pembangunan infrastruktur di masing-
masing negara ASEAN. Selain itu ada
ajakan China untuk membina kerjasama
dalam mewujudkan konsep China tersebut.
Dengan tawaran dana yang menarik ini,
maka China mengharapkan bahwa nantinya
negara-negara ASEAN bisa “memahami”
keinginan China untuk memiliki LCS.
Mengenai sikap ASEAN kepada China,
China sangat m engetahui bahwa masing -
masing negara ASEAN mempunyai sikap
dan pandangan yang berbeda dalam
berhadapan dengan China. Dengan
demikian maka persoalan “cohesiveness”
ASEAN menjadi hal yang sangat “crucial”
ketika harus berhadapan dengan klaim
China di LCS. Ch ina tampak menyadari
betul bahwa ASEAN yang tidak “cohesive”

merupakan satu keberuntungan bagi China
dalam mewujudkan klaimnya di LCS,
karena ASEAN – sebagai organisasi – tidak
akan menjadi “batu sandungan” bagi China.
Oleh karena itu bagi China, strategi yang
terpenting adalah mencari pihak -pihak yang
bisa memahami kemauan China. Pada
ujungnya nanti, ASEAN hanya akan
menjadi “penonton” atas klaim China di LCS.
Perhitungan China itu juga didasarkan pada
fakta bahwa China sudah “bermurah hati”
untuk berinves tasi dalam berbagai proyek
infrastruktur di negara -negara anggota
ASEAN, sehingga diharapkan negara -
negara tersebut akan merasa “enggan”
untuk menentang keinginan China.
Pernyataan Presiden Xi Jinping kepada
dunia internasional
Sebagai bagian dari diploma si China
kepada dunia internasional, penting untuk
dicermati pidato Presiden Xi Jinping yang
berjudul “Together, Let Us Fight COVID -19
and Create a Better Future” dalam “15th G20
Leaders’ Summit” melalui video link, yang
menyampaikan antara lain:7
“China w ill always be a builder of
global peace, a contributor to global
development and a defender of
international order. On the basis of
mutual respect, equality and mutual
benefit, China stands ready to
pursue peacefull coexistence and
common development with all

139533609.htm
countries. We may bridge
differences through dialogue,
resolve disputes through
negotiation, and make joint effort
for world peace and development.”
*
Ucapan Presiden Xi Jinping dalam “Summit
G20” memang terkesan sejuk dan
bersahabat. Namun jangan di lupakan fakta
bahwa saat ini kekuatan militer China
secara konsisten terus membangun pos -
pos di pulau -pulau karang atau bahkan
pulau buatan di LCS. Kredibilitas ucapan
Presiden Xi Jinping masih perlu diuji di
lapangan, karena apa yang diucapkan
Presiden Xi  Jinping sangat berbeda jauh
dengan yang dilakukan militer China di LCS.
Dunia internasional sedang menunggu
konsistensi ucapan Presiden China Xi
Jinping yang mengatakan bahwa “We may
bridge differences through dialogue,
resolve disputes through negotiatio n,
and make joint effort for world peace and
development.”
Peningkatan kegiatan militer di LCS dapat
dilihat dari pembangunan pos -pos militer
China di LCS yang menurut Matts Engman
(Institute for Security and Development
Policy) terdapat militerisasi di LCS yang
berkembang cepat dalam 5 atau 7 tahun
terakhir ini.8

Peran militer China di LCS dapat dilihat dari
pembangunan pos -pos militer China di
pulau-pulau sengketa seperti di Kep.
Paracels dan Kep. Sratlys yang merupakan
tindakan nyata menguasai LCS. Ke depan,
penguasaan atas pulau-pulau tersebut akan
dimanfaatkan untuk memperkuat klaim
China di LCS. Tujuan akhir dari rangkaian
upaya ini ialah bahwa China secara “fait
accompli” akan menguasai pulau -pulau
tersebut dan semua negara  “terpaksa atau
“dipaksa” oleh suatu keadaan untuk
menerima kenyataan tersebut” bahwa
China “sudah” menjadi pemilik LCS. Jika hal
ini terjadi maka akan sulit untuk
memperbaiki keadaan di LCS, dan tidak
tertutup kemungkinan pihak -pihak yang
merasa dilanggar  haknya oleh China akan
memberikan perlawanan secara langsung
sehingga konflik terbuka tidak dapat
terhindarkan.
Dalam kaitan tindakan militer China di LCS
dengan pernyataan Presiden Xi Jinping ini
kiranya perlu dibedakan dengan tegas
antara peran “tentara ” China sebagai
bagian dari “peacekeeping operations” di
bawah bendera PBB, dan peran “tentara”
China dalam “menduduki” dan “menguasai”
LCS di bawah bendera China, karena
sangat jelas perbedaan antara peran
sebagai “peace builder” (dalam kerangka

here/2020/11/22/whats-behind-the-south-china-sea-
dispute? (Tanggal 22 November 2020)
PBB) dan peran sebagai “occupier” (dalam
kerangka menduduki dan menguasai LCS).
Dunia menunggu apakah China bisa
menjadi “mitra” yang bisa dipercaya untuk
mencegah terjadinya konflik terbuka di LCS.
3. China dan keputusan Permanent
Court of Arbitration (PCA) tanggal 12
Juli 2016
Philipina mengajukan gugatan ke
Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) pada
22 Januari 2013 atas klaim dan tindakan
Cina di LCS dalam masalah “maritime
entitlements” dan keabsahan kegiatan
China di LCS.
Namun China menolak kewenangan PCA
dan men ganggap bahwa PCA tidak
mempunai jurisdiksi atas kasus di LCS
karena China menerima penyelesaian
sengketa (dispute settlement) berdasarkan
UNCLOS. Selanjutnya, China juga tidak
pernah hadir atau mengirim wakilnya dalam
persidangan PCA. Oleh karena itu maka
China tidak mengakui keputusan dari PCA
tersebut.
Secara ringkas, keputusan  Permanent
Court of Arbitration  (PCA) tanggal 12 Juli
2016 dapat digambarkan sebagai berikut:9

“Legal Victory for the Philippines against China: A
Case Study” dalam Global Challenges, Issue no.1,
February 2017. Penjelasan lebih rinci dapat dilihat di:

1) Klaim sejarah China berdasarkan
nine-dash line.
Klaim China yang didasarkan pada
klaim sejarah dalam “nine-dash line”
itu bertentangan dengan UNCLOS
(1982).
2) Status dari benda -benda maritim
(maritime features).
Yang dimaksud di sini benda -benda
maritim (maritime features) yang
diduduki China di LCS. Dalam hal ini
akan diputuskan apakah “islands”,
“rocks”, “low-tide levations” (LTE) atau
“submerged banks”  merupakan hal
yang penting.
Dalam kaitan itu, PCA menegaskan
bahwa tindakan China membuat
instalasi dan reklamasi, serta
ditempatkannya personil militer atau
pemerintah atau orang sipil tidak
dapat meningkatkan status atau
kedudukan dari “rock” atau LTE
menjadi pulau yang utuh yang dapat
menimbulkan EEZ (Exclusive
Economic Zone) atau CS (Continental
Shelf).
3) Kegiatan China di LCS
PCA menyatakan bahwa tindakan
pejabat-pejabat dan kapal -kapal
China di LCS yang berlokasi di EEZ
dan CS Philipina telah melanggar
ketentuan dalam UNCLOS.
Selain itu, PCA menilai bahwa
reklamasi tanah yang dilakukan China
dan pembangunan pulau -pulau
buatan, instalasi dan struktur di
Kepulauan Spratly telah menimbulkan
kerusakah parah pada ekosistem
karang serta tidak dapat diperbaiki.
Dalam pandangan penulis, sikap
penolakan China atas kewenangan
dan keputusan PCA didasarkan pada
pertimbangan bahwa:
a) Jika China mematuhi keputusan
PCA maka “perjuangan”
memperoleh LCS yang diduduki
secara illegal China akan
terhenti, karena China mengakui
telah melakukan kesalahan
dalam menduduki LCS.
b) China sebetulnya “menghendaki”
agar permasalahan tindakan
China di LCS diadili oleh
International Court of Justice
(ICJ) karena pengadilan ini
dirasa akan lebih bisa
“mengakomodir” kepentingan
China di LCS tersebut.
4. Kemungkinan China untuk
membawa persoalan klaim China
atas LCS ke International Court of
Justice, Den Haag
Penulis memperkirakan bahwa China akan
membawa permasalahan ini ke International

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
144

Court of Justice  (ICJ) di Den Haag. Untuk
itu, ada beberapa persiapan yang
“dilakukan” China apabila persoalan klaim
wilayah China atas LCS ini dibawa ke ICJ,
antara lain:
1) Klaim China yang dilakukan dengan
cara menduduki pulau -pulau yang
disengketakan dan pembangunan pos -
pos militer di LCS tersebut “diilhami”
oleh keputusan International Court of
Justice (ICJ) di Den Haag dalam kasus
sengketa kepemilikan Pulau Ligitan dan
Pulau Sipadan antara Indonesia dan
Malaysia.
China akan merujuk pada “Keputusan
ICJ” dalam kasus sengketa kepemilikan
Pulau Ligitan dan Pulau Sipadan antara
Indonesia dan Malaysia Untuk
membenarkan dan memperkuat
“penguasaan” dan “pendudukan” China
di pulau-pulau sengketa di LCS.
China akan menggunakan keputusan
ICJ tersebut sebagai “preseden” untuk
menguatkan dan mempertahankan
klaimnya atas LCS sebagai wilayahnya.
Terlebih lagi China m empunyai
kepercayaan diri yang sangat besar
karena memilki kekuatan politik,
ekonomi dan militer yang tidak bisa
diabaikan.
Adapun isi ringkas keputusan ICJ
tanggal 17 Desember 2002 tersebut
antara lain:10
a. Butir 143:
As evidence of such effective
administration over the islands,
Malaysia cites the measures
taken by the North Borneo
authorities to regulate and control
the collecting of turtle eggs on
Ligitan and Sipadan, an activity of
some economic significance in
the area at the time. It refers in
particular to the Turtle
Preservation Ordinance of 1917,
the purpose of which was to limit
the capture of turtles and the
collection of turtle eggs “within the
State [of North Borneo] or the
territorial waters thereof.”

b. Butir 144:
Malaysia also refers to the fact
that in 1933 Sipadan under
Section 28 of the Land Ordinance,
1930, was declared to be “a
reserve for the purpose of bird
sanctuaries.”

c. Butir 145:
The Court is of the opinion tht
both the measures taken to
regulate and control the collecting
of turtle egg s and the
establishment of a bird reserve
must be seen as a regulatory and
administrative assertions of
authority over territory which is
specified by name.


10 Sumber: Keputusan “INTERNATIONAL COURT OF
JUSTICE” dengan judul “REPORTS OF JUDGMENTS,
ADVISORY OPINIONS AND ORDERS: CASE
CONCERNING SOVEREIGNTY OVER PULAU LIGITAN
AND PULAU SIPADAN. (INDONESIA/MALAYSIA).”
JUDGMENT OF 17 DECEMBER 2002

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021

d. Butir 148:
The Court notes that the activities
relied upon by Malaysia, both in
its own name and  as successor
State of Great Britain, are modest
in number but that they are
diverse in character and include
legislative, administrative and
quasi-judicial acts. They cover a
considerable period of time and
show a pattern revealing an
intention to exercis e State
functions in respect of the two
islands in the context of the
administration of a wider range of
islands.

e. Butir 149:
Given the circumstances of the
case, and in partular in view of
the evidence furnished by the
Parties, the Court concludes that
Malaysia has title to Ligitan and
Sipadan on the basis of the
effectivités referred to above.

f. Butir 150.
For these reasons,
THE COURT,
By sixteen votes to one,
Finds that sovereignty over Pulau
Sipadan and Pulau Ligitan
belongs to Malaysia.
2) China akan memanfaatkan waktu yang
ada (sampai tahun 2049) untuk
menguasai dan menduduki pulau -pulau
sengketa di LCS dengan membangun
pos-pos militer. Pos-pos militer ini akan
menjadi faktor penting untuk
“memperkuat” penguasaan pulau-pulau
tersebut sebagai “fait acc ompli” yang
harus diterima oleh negara -negara lain.
Dengan kondisi seperti itu maka China
berkeyakinan bahwa telah menguasai
pulau-pulau tersebut secara “effective”.
Sehingga berdasarkan prinsip “effective
occupation” maka klaim China atas
pulau-pulau di LCS adalah sah.
Upaya China memperkuat kehadiran di
LCS
Upaya China untuk memiliki LCS secara
ringkas digambarkan oleh Tim Marshall
yang menyatakan bahwa peta wilayah LCS
yang dibuat oleh China saat ini
menunjukkan bahwa seluruh LCS adalah
milik China.  Pembuatan peta itu
menunjukkan maksud China yang
didukung oleh patrol i angkatan laut yang
agresif dan pernyataan resmi. Beijing
bermaksud untuk mengubah cara berpikir
negara-negara tetangganya serta
mengubah cara pandang dan tindakan AS
– yaitu mendorong dan mendorong sebuah
agenda yang membuat para pesaingnya
(utamanya AS dan sekutunya ) mundur
(dari LCS).11
Pemerintah China telah memberi
kewenangan baru kepada pasukan
penjaga pantai (Coast Guard) – dan bukan
kekuatan angkatan lautnya – untuk
beroperasi di Laut  China Selatan untuk
memberikan “kesan” bahwa LCS adalah
milik Cina yang cukup dijaga oleh pasukan

and updated edition. London: Elliot and Thompson
Limited, 2016. Halaman 59

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
146

penjaga pantai saja – sedangkan angkatan
lautnya hanya digunakan sebagai
“pendukung” dari Coast Guard. Kekuatan
angkatan lautnya disiapkan apabila
memang bet ul-betul dibutuhkan untuk
menghadapi kekuatan negara lain yang
dinilai menghambat kepentingan dan
ambisi China untuk menguasai LCS. Hal ini
berarti bahwa China secara sadar,
sistematis, dan terukur sudah menyiapkan
skenario perang di Laut China Selatan
yang diawali dengan cara mengabaikan
Konvensi Hukum Laut Internasional.
Pada bulan Maret 2021, China telah
menyebarkan sekitar 200 kapalnya di
wilayah yang diklaim China di LCS.
Tindakan itu jelas suatu tindakan yang
sewenang-wenang dan lebih
mengedepankan kekuatan militer.
Dengan menyebarkan 200 kapal tersebut
maka China ingin menyampaikan pesan
sebagai berikut:
a. Wilayah LCS adalah “milik” China,
sehingga oleh karena itu maka
“hanya” China yang boleh dan bisa
berbuat sesukanya.
b. Sebagai cara China untuk “ test the
water” artinya apakah ada negara
yang berani menentang kebijakan
China tersebut, misalnya dengan
mengirim kapal ke wilayah tersebut.
Yang ditunggu China adalah reaksi
Amerika Serikat atas kebijakan
China tersebut.
c. Jika tidak ada yang menentang
kebijakan tersebut secara faktual –
yaitu dengan mengirim kapal
tandingan ke wilayah tersebut –
maka China akan memperoleh
konfirmasi bahwa klaimnya “benar”
karena tidak ada satupun negara
yang mengirim kapal mereka ke
wilayah yang diklaim China tersebut.
Pembentukan AUKUS
Pada tanggal 15 September 2021, di
Washington D.C (AS), telah ditandatangani
naskah pembentukan AUKUS (Australia,
the United Kingdom, and the United States)
oleh para menteri luar negeri dari ketiga
negara tersebut.
Pembentukan AUKUS ini menjadi  satu
fenomena yang perlu dicermati karena
meskipun secara resmi dikatakan tidak
ditujukan kepada satu negara tertentu,
namun jika melihat perkembangan di LCS
yang memperlihatkan kesewenang -
wenangan China dalam upayanya untuk
“menguasai” LCS yang – dengan sengaja –
mengabaikan Konvensi Hukum Laut
InternasionaL (1982), maka pembentukan
AUKUS ini bermaksud “membendung”
langkah China di LCS. Munculnya AUKUS
ini berpotensi menjadi “pesaing” atau
bahkan “penghambat” bagi perwujudan
klaim China di LCS.

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
147

Salah satu bentuk kerjasama kongkrit
dalam kerangka AUKUS ialah rencana AS
dan Inggris untuk berbagi teknologi dengan
Australia untuk membuat kapal selam
bertenaga nuklir. Selain itu, Inggris juga
berniat untuk meningkatkan kehadiran
militernya di LCS.
China ten tu tidak merasa nyaman dengan
kehadiran AUKUS dan akan mencermati
setiap tindakan AUKUS, terlebih lagi
setelah ada kesepakatan bahwa AS akan
membantu Australia untuk membangun
kapal selam bertenaga nuklir.
Perkembangan AUKUS ke depan sedikit
banyaknya akan menjadi faktor bagi China
untuk menyesuaikan strateginya
menguasai LCS.
Pembentukan AUKUS ini juga tidak dapat
dipisahkan dengan kepentingan AS yang
tidak ingin “freedom of navigation ” nya di
LCS dihambat oleh China.
Perkembangan ini perlu dicermati agar
tidak terjadi “benturan” yang tidak perlu
antara China dan AUKUS.
Dengan adanya AUKUS ini maka untuk
wilayah Asia Tenggara sudah terdapat 2
(dua) aliansi/persekutuan di bidang militer
yaitu FPDA (Five Power Defense
Agreement) dan AUKUS. Keberadaan
aliansi militer tersebut, maka wilayah Indo -
Pasifik (yang terbentang dari India sampai
dengan New Zealand dan kepulauan di
Pasifik) – termasuk Asia Tenggara –
menunjukkan bahwa kawasan LCS
berpotensi menjadi “ flashpoint” baru yang
jika tidak disikapi sejak dini a kan bisa
menjadi konflik terbuka yang akibatnya
sangat merugikan bagi wilayah sekitar,
khususnya ASEAN.
Peran ASEAN untuk mencegah konflik
terbuka di LCS
Tindakan China yang dilakukan secara
sadar, sistematis dan didukung kekuatan
militer untuk melakukan “ encroachment”
atas LCS secara tidak sah adalah suatu
tindakan yang tidak bisa dibiarkan tanpa
mendapat reaksi yang tepat dan cepat.
Untuk itu, ASEAN mempunyai peran yang
penting untuk mencegah terjadinya konflik
terbuka di LCS. ASEAN perlu memberi
pengertian kepada China agar
menghentikan tindakannya melakukan
“encroachment” di LCS yang dapat
mengancam kedamaian dan keamanan di
Asia Tenggara, dan di sisi lain memberi
pengertian negara -negara luar kawasan
Asia Tenggara untuk tidak melakukan
tindakan militer di LCS.
Sebagai kumpulan 10 negara yang
berkepentingan langsung dengan
kedamaian dan keamanan di Asia
Tenggara, maka menjadi hal yang wajar
jika ASEAN mengambil peran utama
(“driving seat ”) untuk mengambil berbagai

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
148

inisiatif konstruktif untuk mencegah
eskalasi permasalahan di LCS yang sudah
semakin besar dan bertambah rawan, agar
tidak menjadi permasalahan yang semakin
besar sehingga sulit untuk diselesaikan
dengan damai.
Dalam konteks ini, ASEAN sudah
mempunyai konsep yang dapat digunakan
untuk mencegah t imbulnya konflik terbuka
di LCS. Dunia sudah mengenal TAC
(Treaty of Amity and Cooperation),
ZOPFAN (Zone of Peace, Freedom and
Neutrality), SEANWFZ (Southeast Asia
Nuclear Weapon Free Zone), dan ARF
(ASEAN Regional Forum).  Konsep-konsep
ini perlu diingat kan lagi kepada semua
pihak yang berkepentingan.
Dalam konteks inisiatif ASEAN ini maka
PBB menjadi salah satu tempat yang tepat
untuk “mengingatkan” dunia akan adanya
potensi konflik baru di Asia Tenggara yaitu
di LCS.

KESIMPULAN
Berdasarkan pembahasan di atas,
disampaikan kesimpulan sebagai berikut:
1. China akan terus “melakukan” dan
bahkan “mempertegas” klaim
wilayahnya atas LCS dengan
memanfaatkan sumber daya yang
dimilikinya, antara lain kekuatan
ekonomi dan militernya. Bagi China,
mengintegrasikan LCS  sebagai bagian
dari “21st Century Maritime Silk Road”
adalah tugas sejarah yang harus
dilaksanakan dan diwujudkan.  China
punya waktu 28 tahun untuk
mewujudkannya.
2. China menggunakan taktik “mengulur
waktu” (buying time) yaitu pada satu
sisi “mengedepankan”  diplomasi
infrastruktur ekonomi, namun pada saat
yang bersamaan “memperkuat”
kehadiran militernya di LCS antara lain
dengan membangun dan memperkuat
pos-pos atau pangkalan militernya di
pulau-pulau yang juga di klaim oleh
beberapa negara ASEAN.
3. China aka n menggunakan “kehadiran”
militernya di pulau -pulau di LCS
sebagai “fait accompli” yang harus
diterima negara lain dan tidak bisa
diganggu gugat. Untuk itu, maka China
akan “membawa” permasalahan
klaimnya atas LCS ini ke International
Court of Justice  (ICJ). China akan
menggunakan “pendudukannya” atas
pulau-pulau di LCS – meskipun illegal –
sebagai alasan “pembenar” atas
klaimnya di LCS berdasarkan prinsip
“effective occupation”.
4. Tindakan China di LCS ini
mengingatkan pada satu ungkapan
dalam Bahasa Latin y ang

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 6 No.2, Jul-Des 2021
149

mengatatakan “si vis pacem para
bellum” yang artinya ialah  “if you want
peace prepare for war.” Saat ini yang
dilakukan China adalah memperkuat
militernya, menduduki LCS secara
diam-diam dan konsisten, dan jika
memang diperlukan maka tentara
China akan  “mempertahankan”
kepemilikan China di LCS, utamanya
dalam menghadapi tekanan AS dan
sekutunya.
5. Konsep China untuk menguasai
wilayah Laut China Selatan ialah
“duduki/kuasai dulu, adapun urusan
lainnya – politik, hukum internasional,
protes negara -negara l ain, dan
seterusnya – itu adalah urusan
kemudian.
Penutup
Sebagai penutup, disampaikan sebagai
berikut:
1. Adalah satu hal yang ironis bahwa
China adalah negara pihak yang
menandatangani dan meratifikasi
UNCLOS 1982, namun China secara
sadar dan konsisten melanggar
UNCLOS 1982. Tidak terlalu berlebihan
dikatakan di sini bahwa hukum
internasional (UNCLOS 1982) hanya
akan berlaku bagi China jika negara
yang bersangkutan menghendakinya.
2. China sebagai anggota tetap Dewan
Keamanan PBB mempunyai tan ggung
jawab menjadi penjaga perdamaian
dan keamanan, bukan sebaliknya.
Dunia ingin melihat konsistensi China
yang menyatakan dirinya sebagai
“peace builder”.
3. Untuk mencegah konflik terbuka di LCS
maka peran organisasi kawasan seperti
ASEAN menjadi penting,  terlebih lagi
dengan dukungan yang kuat dari PBB.
Untuk itu, perlu sinergi yang kuat antara
ASEAN dan PBB. ASEAN perlu
mengambil inisiatif aktif untuk
mencegah terjadinya konflik terbuka di
LCS.  Utamanya ialah dalam menyikapi
klaim wilayah China atas LCS . Hanya
persoalannya, apakah ASEAN
mempunyai “cohesiveness” dan
kebijakan yang utuh dalam berhadapan
dengan China.
4. Jika terjadi konflik terbuka di LCS,
maka pihak yang paling bertanggung
jawab atas terjadinya konflik tersebut
adalah China yang bertahan pad a
keinginannya untuk “memiliki” LCS
yang didasarkan pada konsep nine-
dash line yang tidak mempunyai dasar
hukum.
5. Sekuat dan sebesar apapun suatu
negara, maka negara tersebut tetap
memerlukan negara lain untuk

melakukan berbagai kerjasama atau
dalam rangka  memungkinkan
rakyatnya ingin bepergian ke negara
lain.
