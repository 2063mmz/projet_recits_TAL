Introduction
The global system is currently undergoing a transformation marked by the decline of US hegemonic power and the rise of multiple power centers. Instead of maintaining stability, this shift has created a multipolar disorder in which competing great powers, regional powers, middle powers, and Non-State Actors pursue their own agendas through rival strategies rather than developing a coherent cooperation framework. Today, the world faces unprecedented inter- and intra-state conflicts and proxy wars
[1]
. The post-Cold War rules of the game, such as value-based diplomacy, multilateralism, the responsibility to protect (R2P), and collective security, are gradually giving way to a new normal characterized by transactional diplomacy, geo-economics, and geostrategic calculations. Therefore, a multipolar world disorder presents Ethiopia with both opportunities and challenges. Ethiopia’s foreign policy should, thus, be recalibrated to navigate this uncertain global system. The purpose of this commentary is twofold: to clarify the nature of the contemporary world order and to identify policy implications for Ethiopia. This analysis uses cases from Eastern Europe, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific regions.
Manifestations of Multipolar World Disorder and the New Normal
The current world order is best depicted as a multipolar disorder, characterized by fragmented multiple power centers, enduring competition, and weakened multilateral institutions. Unlike the liberal International Order (LIO), which was characterized by unipolar dominance under US hegemony, the contemporary world lacks a single actor that sets the rules; instead, multiple actors on different fronts define relations through hard power and geo-strategic calculations. Military rearmament and deterrence have resurfaced in global politics. Tariff policy, visa restrictions, technology, and energy flows are being weaponized as strategic foreign policy tools. At the same time, gray zone tactics such as hybrid competition, proxy wars, information warfare, and cyber-attacks have blurred the line between war and peace, making resilience a state foreign policy priority. Existing multilateral institutions are unable to enforce liberal international norms, while new rules of the game have been experienced through flexible and issue-based alliances. Middle powers and smaller states are responding to this environment by diversifying partnerships and hedging rather than aligning rigidly. State survival and influence now depend on diplomatic dexterity. These new normal are currently manifested in various regions of the world.
For instance, the Russia–Ukraine war is the central illustration of multipolar global disorder, which reshapes global defense postures, testing security architectures, trade routes, and alliances. For example, NATO is caught between the need for institutional expansion and the decline of transatlantic cohesion. Amidst efforts to expand to the eastern margin, including Poland and the Baltic states, NATO faced challenges from Russia, its security competitor, and uncertainty about US commitments. The Russia-Ukraine war, accompanied by NATO fragmentation, manifested the global multipolar disorder and tested Western States’ resilience.
Second, the Horn of Africa stands as another reflection of multipolar disorder, where domestic crises intersect with regional rivalries and great-power competition. Eritrea has leveraged instability to project proxy politics, while Somalia remains locked in struggles with Al-Shebab. South Sudan is embroiled in enduring internal conflicts, whereas Sudan descended into large-scale war. These conflicts are exacerbated by external rivalries: the Gulf States and Turkey compete to control Sea corridors; Ethiopia and Egypt remain at odds over the Nile River; and China and the US view the Red Sea as a strategic seafaring route linking the Indo-Pacific to Europe. Thus, in the Horn, the defining reality is that multipolar disorder manifests through domestic crises, blended with regional and global power rivalries. The policy challenge is therefore balancing stabilization with long-term resilience: taming Sudan’s war spillover, dealing with the Ethiopia-Egypt Nile rivalry, supporting Somali state-building, disciplining the Eritrea regime’s behavior, and maintaining access to the Red Sea amid geostrategic rivalries.
Third, the Middle East has been another laboratory for multipolar disorder, where Gulf rivalries intersect with great-power competitions. The Israel–Hamas war has heightened these conventional dynamics, recommencing focus on the Palestinian issue, the Axis of Resistance, and derailing normalization efforts like the Abraham Accords. Non-state actors such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis have taken advantage of weakened security architectures to advance their interests. Most of the regional states are skillfully balancing between rival blocs while prioritizing their own interests. Meanwhile, global powers project their influence selectively: the U.S. maintains deterrence but decreases its long-term presence; Russia exploits its influence in Syria but declines due to the fall of Bashar al-Assad; and China places itself as a mediator. Blended with traditional Gulf rivalries, the Israel–Hamas war highlights the shift of global order from U.S.-dominated unipolarity to multipolar disorder.
Fourth, the Indo-Pacific is another key demonstration of contemporary multipolar competition, where strategic rivalry between the United States and China reinforced. The U.S. works to protect trade routes, promote liberal values, and counter China’s growing influence through a combination of military presence, security alliances like the Quad
[2]
, engagement with ASEAN, and economic initiatives like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. Conversely, China is working to expand its maritime influence, secure key sea lanes, and assert its territorial claims in the South China Sea using strategies such as the Digital Silk Road, the Belt and Road Initiative, and military rejuvenation. This rivalry has polarized and militarized the South China Sea. Thus, multipolar world disorder has become the new normal, leading states to adapt new instruments, strategies, and alliances. In the contemporary world, regional rivalry, geopolitics, geo-economics, geostrategic considerations, and new partnerships have become the new normal that governs state behavior in their conduct of foreign policy. These global new normal have multiple implications for Ethiopia’s foreign policy.
Implications for Ethiopia and Foreign Policy Options
First, unless carefully managed, the new normal poses a challenge to Ethiopia’s ability to pursue strategic autonomy by creating an abandonment-entrapment dilemma by great powers. Aligning too closely with one camp could provoke retaliatory measures from rival blocs. Thus, it requires careful balancing. Second, a multipolar world disorder also allows Ethiopia to diversify its partnerships. The Gulf States offer trade and investment options, Turkey provides investment and military equipment, China remains a strategic partner, and other Asian countries are engaged in multi-sectoral relations with Ethiopia. Western governments, despite their differing political views, remain crucial for providing high-value markets, investments, and advanced technologies. The policy concern is how to sustain and advance these relationships without pledge into evolving rivalries.
Third, Ethiopia’s location in the Horn of Africa places it at the heart of a regional security complex where global rivalries intersect. The competition over the Red Sea, the Nile rivalry, and the fragility of regional states are all risks that could be amplified by external power involvement. It is Ethiopia’s responsibility to avert its neighborhood from becoming a proxy battlefield.
Based on the above discussions, this commentary paper identified the following policy options for Ethiopia;
Pragmatic Alignment: To navigate the essence of a multipolar disorder, Ethiopia should prioritize pragmatic alignment, engaging with all major powers based on issue-specific concerns, while avoiding rigid bloc commitments. Ethiopia should sidestep strict alignment with any single political camp and instead focus on interest-driven cooperation with multiple power centers.
Economic and Diplomatic Resilience
: carefully expanding and sustaining the homegrown economy and economic diversification to realize national resilience, and also, balancing external financing by confirming that infrastructure and investments partnerships from China, the Gulf States, or the BRICS+, complemented with loans, investment, and trade access coming from Western countries. Here, careful consideration should be given to the US’s new Africa commercial diplomacy, which promotes large-scale and selective investment and trade in Africa, as these investments and trade policies complement Ethiopia’s efforts to attract anchor investors and foster trade. Additionally, investing in professional diplomatic training and technology diplomacy (including the appointment of a tech Ambassador) will enhance Ethiopia’s ability to steer the complexities of a multipolar technological world to foster state resilience.
Regional Diplomacy First and Leveraging Pan-Africanism
:  Regionally, Ethiopia should forefront dialogue on regional and Red Sea security architecture, recognizing that its long-term maritime interests depend on cooperation and its regional anchor roles. Thus, easing relations with Sudan, Somalia, and Eritrea is crucial in shielding Ethiopia from the external exploitation of local conflicts. To do these, Ethiopia must strengthen regional strategic interdependence and communication. Furthermore, although the rise of geopolitical competition has weakened multilateral organizations, Ethiopia can still utilize African consensus platforms as diplomatic leverage to enhance its diplomatic bargaining chips.
To conclude, the current multipolar world is characterized by less stability, increased chaos, greater fragmentation, and heightened competition. For example, the situations in Eastern Europe, the Indo-Pacific, the Middle East, and the Horn of Africa highlight how current global and regional rivalries complicate global security, eventually weakening the long-promised global collective security. For Ethiopia, these dynamics underscore the need for a pragmatic foreign policy that balances relations with competing great powers, leverages its continental influence, strengthens regional diplomacy, and enhances national resilience.
