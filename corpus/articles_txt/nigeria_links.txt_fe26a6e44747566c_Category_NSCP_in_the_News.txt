Minister for Industry and DG NCSP outline Key Priorities for Industrial Transformation
In a bold push to accelerate Nigeria’s industrial transformation under President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda, the Director-General of the Nigeria-China Strategic Partnership (NCSP), Mr. Joseph Tegbe, met with the Honourable Minister of State for Industry, Trade, and Investment, Sen John Owan Enoh to outline strategic priorities that will drive economic self-reliance and inclusive growth. While receiving the DG, the Honourable Minister outlined the Federal Government’s focus on revitalizing three critical sectors: Sugar, Cotton-Textile-Garment (CTG), and Automobiles. These sectors—each supported by dedicated industry councils—form the backbone of a broader strategy to boost local production, stimulate domestic demand, and enhance global competitiveness. Central to this strategy is the Nigerian First Policy, a directive by President Tinubu that mandates all Ministries, Departments, and Agencies to prioritize Nigerian-made goods and services in public procurement. This policy is already reshaping procurement practices, generating jobs, and reducing reliance on imports. Reinforcing this agenda, DG NCSP Joseph Tegbe affirmed Nigeria’s commitment to transitioning from a consumption-based economy to a production and export-driven industrial power, positioning itself as a development partner to China rather than a mere trading counterpart. Drawing on Brazil’s export success—reaching $94.41 billion in trade with China in 2024—he emphasized Nigeria’s readiness to replicate such growth across sectors including agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. To fast-track implementation, the Honourable Minister spotlighted the launch of the Industrial Revolution Working Groups (IRWG), a key component of the Presidential Council on Industrial Revitalization Roadmap. These working groups, comprising government and development partners, are driving reforms across infrastructure, access to finance, and technological innovation to revive dormant industries and expand production. On the investment front, the NCSP is mobilizing leading Chinese firms to set up production facilities in Nigeria. Landmark agreements have been secured with Huawei, China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), Chilwee Group, Choice International Group (CIG) and others across manufacturing, automotive, communication technology, and renewable energy. These partnerships are expected to generate thousands of jobs and accelerate Nigeria’s transition to value-added production. As Nigeria moves steadily toward industrial self-sufficiency, the Nigeria-China Strategic Partnership remains a vital pillar of the Renewed Hope Agenda, leveraging China’s Belt and Road Initiative to unlock transformative investments that will power long-term, sustainable national development.
FG Reconvenes Inter-Ministerial Meeting to Accelerate Implementation of Nigeria-China Focac Agreements
In a renewed effort to fast-track the implementation of strategic agreements with the People’s Republic of China, the Federal Government of Nigeria has reconvened a high-level inter-ministerial follow-up meeting. The session, jointly organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Nigeria-China Strategic Partnership (NCSP), focused on reviewing progress and resolving challenges related to outcomes from the 2024 FOCAC Summit and President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s historic state visit to China. The meeting, chaired by Ambassador Janet Olisa, Director of Regions at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, brought together key representatives from Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) involved in the bilateral cooperation. MDAs provided situation reports and outlined steps to strengthen collaboration for the successful implementation of signed agreements. Ambassador Olisa reaffirmed Nigeria’s commitment to leveraging its strategic partnership with China for inclusive economic development. She emphasized the urgency of converting memoranda of understanding (MOUs) into actionable projects that deliver tangible benefits to Nigerians. Discussions focused on resolving legal and institutional bottlenecks, aligning implementation strategies, and clarifying access modalities to Nigeria’s targeted share of China’s $51 billion pledge for green infrastructure development across Africa. Nigeria aims to secure at least $10 billion in funding for priority sectors including agriculture, digital economy, and critical infrastructure. Director-General of NCSP, Mr. Joseph Tegbe, reiterated the agency’s role in coordinating implementation efforts and called on MDAs to be proactive. “This partnership offers Nigeria a unique opportunity to unlock investments that will drive job creation, economic diversification, and long-term prosperity,” he stated. Resolutions from the meeting included harmonization of legal frameworks, alignment of project roadmaps, budget optimization, and the establishment of technical committees to accelerate implementation. A follow-up review session has been scheduled in the coming weeks to track progress on agreed action items, while the various MDAs continue their working meeting to resolve challenges. The Nigeria-China Strategic Partnership remains a cornerstone of the Renewed Hope Agenda, complementing China’s Belt and Road Initiative to catalyze transformative development in Nigeria.

Nigeria to become net exporter to China soon, says DG China-Nigeria partnership
The Director General, China-Nigeria Partnership, Joseph Tegbe, Thursday 28 November 2024 disclosed that Nigeria’s target is to be the net exporter to China in the next five years.  Brazil is currently the net exporter to China in sum of $104.32 billion, according ording to 2023 record on the United Nations COMTRADE database on international trade. Nigeria presently has an export in region of $22 billion as at 2023.  Tegbe, who spoke at the opening of the China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo in Abuja, however said that the narative is about to change with the latest upgrade of China-Nigeria relations into partnership.   He said: “One of our primary goals is to increase trade volume between Nigeria and China.  As of December 2003, trade volume between Nigeria and China was about $22 billion.  “But on the other hand, when you look at Brazil and China’s relationship, today, Brazil ranks as China’s ninth largest trading country. And during this same period, Brazil’s export to China in 2023 was $105 billion. While China’s export to Brazil was just $59 billion. Thus making Brazil a net exporter to China. “Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, this is our desired position as a nation of Nigeria. For us, the next five years, to push our trade volume between China and Nigeria higher than what it used today and for Nigeria to become a net exporter to China.” He also added: “It is also worth noting that industrializing Nigeria means industrializing 25% of Africa. An economically sound and stable Nigeria signifies a prosperous continent of Africa.” He also disclosed that no fewer than 1200 Nigerians are trained yearly by the Chinese firm, Huawei, as a pointer of the new things to come. He also said 30 Nigerian officials, drawn from diffferent sectors of the economy are undergoing training.  He said: “The Nigerian-China Strategic Partnership is already meeting results. As of today, one of China’s companies, Huawei, trains an average of 1,200 Nigerians every year in Nigeria. “As we speak, 30 Nigerian officials, drawn from various ministries, departments and agencies, are in China, undergoing an intensive training on the governance of China and the strengthening of economic development between China and Nigeria.” Speaking on the Expo, the Chinese Ambassador to Nigeria, Yu Dunhai said: “This exhibition is an important event organized to implement the outcomes of the Beijing Summit Forum and the consensus reached between our two heads of state. I am pleased to see that this exhibition brings together many outstanding entrepreneurs and innovators in a wide range of fields, including engineering, contracting, advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, energy conservation, environmental protection, and green energy. “Through the exhibition and exchanges, we believe it can play an important role in further promoting the process of industrialization and agricultural modernization in Nigeria, and facilitate in-depth cooperation between our two countries in all fields.” Also,Mr Fang Qiuchen, Chairman, China International Contractors Association revealed that Chinese firms are mobilising funds to invest in Nigeria as a fallout of the recent FOCAC summit.  He said: “We want to be together to work on the infrastructure, on the projects, especially on the new energy projects, as well as the digital smart cities, many renovation projects. “So we are here, we’ll bring the capital, we’ll bring our technology, we’ll also bring the very genuine, honest, we want to collaborate with the Nigerian partners for a very pragmatic cooperation to do some of the works here so that we can grow together to benefit the economic and social development of Nigeria”. Stressing on the funding of infrastructure, Fang said: “So China is also working with a consortium of all the banks together, African banks and China Development Bank. We want to work together to financing more of the projects here in Nigeria, so that they can benefit the economic development.” “Though, he failed to disclosed the amount they are brining in, he however said: “The investment we can see is huge, I should say, because the projects are not small, because it’s infrastructure.” He also added: “As the new round of scientific and technological revolution and digital transformation is on the way, green development and the digital economy have emerged as new engines driving economic growth, presenting vast opportunities for cooperation in green and sustainable infrastructure. Both China and Nigeria are actively exploring the use of advanced technologies, such as big data, cloud computing, and Al, to enhance the intelligence and automation of infrastructure. The integration of digital technology with new infrastructure, the blue economy, and agricultural modernization has emerged as a focal point for cooperation. Furthermore, renewable energy projects, including solar and wind, are gaining increased attention worldwide, further advancing the development and utilization of the clean energy.  “We believe that through the elevation of the bilateral relationship to the comprehensive strategic partnership, and through our joint efforts, the bilateral infrastructure cooperation will for sure yield more fruitful results in the days to come.”
Africa, China partnership must evolve from raw material to industrialisation – FG
The Federal Government, through the Nigeria-China Strategic Partnership Office, has said that the partnership between both Africa and China must evolve from one based on trade in raw materials to one focused on shared prosperity, industrialisation, and economic diversification. Joseph Tegbe, director-general, Nigeria-China Strategic Partnership (NCSP), stated this at the China-Africa Interbank Association meeting held in Abuja. According to him, China, in the past 20 years, has emerged as sub-Saharan Africa’s largest bilateral trading partner. Quoting the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the DG noted that around 20 percent of the region’s exports now go to China while about 16 percent of Africa’s imports are from China, which amounted to a record $282 billion in total trade volume in 2023. He noted that Nigeria must leverage Chinese industrialisation and diversification to create long-term wealth, create jobs, and reduce poverty in Nigeria and Africa at large. “China and Africa stand on the threshold of a new era of cooperation. The partnership must evolve from one based on trade in raw materials to one focused on shared prosperity, industrialization, and economic diversification. “Chinese investments in infrastructure, energy, and telecommunications are transforming key sectors of African economies and providing the foundation for long-term growth and development. “African countries must prioritize the development of industries capable of processing and refining raw materials. China’s experience in transforming itself from a manufacturing powerhouse to a global economic leader offers valuable lessons,” he said. On industrialization as a catalyst for change, Tegbe said that China would play a pivotal role as Chinese companies had contributed to the development of manufacturing in Africa, from textiles to automotive assembly and electronics. “However, in order to move the needle significantly, we must focus on developing a sustainable industry that is deeply connected to the local economy.
