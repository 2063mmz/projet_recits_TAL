On July 26, President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev received the Minister of National Defense of the Republic of Turkey Nurettin Canikli, who is in our country on an official visit.
The head of our state, warmly welcoming the guest, noted the intensification of contacts at various levels and mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries with satisfaction.
It was emphasized that the fruitful meetings of the leaders of Uzbekistan and Turkey that were held in Samarkand in November of the last year and within the framework of the international forum “One belt, one road” in Beijing in May of this year gave a new dynamic to the development of bilateral multifaceted relations, including in political, trade-economic, investment and cultural-humanitarian spheres.
During the conversation, the prospects of military and military-technical cooperation were also discussed. Establishment of a practical partnership between the ministries of defense of Uzbekistan and Turkey, including implementation of joint programs in the field of military education is defined as one of the important areas.
