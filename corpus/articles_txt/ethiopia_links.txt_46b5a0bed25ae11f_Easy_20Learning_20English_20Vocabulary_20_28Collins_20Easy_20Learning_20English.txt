introduction
Collins	Easy	Learning	English	Vocabulary
	is	designed	for	anyone
who	wants	to	broaden	their	knowledge	of	English	words	in	key
everyday	situations.	Whether	you	need	English	at	work,	at
school	or	university,	or	for	a	holiday,
Collins	Easy	Learning
English	Vocabulary
	offers	you	the	information	you	require	in	a
clear	and	accessible	format.
This	book	is	divided	into	50	subject	areas.	These	cover	such
topics	as	‘air	travel’,	‘business’,	‘food	and	drink’	and	‘science’,
arranged	in	alphabetical	order.	This	arrangement	by	subject
area	helps	you	to	learn	related	words	and	phrases	together.	In
this	way,	you	can	always	be	sure	of	using	the	right	word	in	the
right	context.
Within	each	topic,	vocabulary	is	divided	into	nouns,	verbs,
adjectives,	adverbs,	phrases	and	idioms.	Each	word	is	defined
in	relation	to	the	topic	in	question.	For	example,	in	‘air	travel’,
the	meaning	that	is	given	for	the	word
connection
	is:
‘a	plane	that	leaves	after	another	one	arrives	and	allows	you	to
continue	your	journey	by	changing	from	one	to	the	other’.
In	‘computers	and	the	internet’,	on	the	other	hand,
connection
	is
defined	in	terms	of	its	computer-related	sense:
‘a	link	between	a	computer	and	a	network’.

For	each	topic,	there	are	plenty	of	authentic	example	sentences
from	the	Collins	corpus.	These	show	you	how	words	and
phrases	are	used	in	real	English.
At	the	end	of	the	book,	there	are	additional	sections	on	place
names	and	people,	numbers,	measurements,	times	and	dates.
There	is	also	an	alphabetical	index,	and	a	list	of	irregular	verbs.
We	hope	that	this	book	will	help	you	to	expand	your
knowledge	of	English	vocabulary	in	a	wide	range	of	situations.

There	are	different	ways	that	the	noun	for	a	place	changes	to
become	the	noun	for	a	person	from	that	place,	or	to	become
the	adjective	for	that	place.	For	places	ending	in	‘-a’,	the	person
noun	and	the	adjective	usually	end	in	‘-an’,	for	example
Australia	→	Australian.
I	live	in	Australia.
I	am	an	Australian.
I	am	Australian.
…the	Australian	flag.
Here	are	some	other	examples	of	words	that	work	this	way:
Place	 nouns	 that	 end	 in	 –a	 →	 person	 nouns	 and
adjectives	that	end	in	–an
Africa→African,	 America→American,	 Asia→Asian,
Austria→Austrian,	Bulgaria→Bulgarian,	Cuba→Cuban,
India→Indian,	 Kenya→Kenyan,	 Malaysia→Malaysian,
Russia→Russian,	 Slovakia→Slovakian,
Slovenia→Slovenian
There	is	no	plural	form	for	‘person’	words	that	end	in	‘-s’	or	‘-
ese’,	for	example	‘a	Swiss’	and	‘a	Chinese’.	The	singular	form	of
these	words	are	also	not	used	very	often,	and	it	is	more
common	to	say	‘a	Swiss	man’	or	‘a	Chinese	woman’.

Other	place	names	change	in	different	ways.	Here	is	a	list	of
some	of	the	well-known	ones:	If	there	is	a	language	related	to	a
particular	country,	the	name	of	the	language	is	usually	the
same	as	the	adjective	describing	the	country,	for	example
Polish,
Japanese,	Italian.
