ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The 1st edition of the Community Based Participatory Watershed Development (CBPWD) guideline
developed in 2005 with the involvement professionals from the GO and NGOs is a pioneer and a
springboard for the watershed development in Ethiopia. The NR&FS sector is grateful to acknowledge all
those who participated in the first edition, and special thanks to Lakew Desta, Hune Nega, Tariku Alemu
and Betru Nedassa for contribution in the 1st and in this updated 2nd edition. Our gratitude also extends to
GIZ and WF P who allowed their staff to contribute in both editions. The immense contribution of Volli
Carucci in the 1st edition, and his encouragement and guide on the onset of this work can’t be forgotten.
This national guideline as a 2nd edition has been a concerted process led by the NRMD. The NR&FS sector
is grateful to all those who participated in the gap assessment, consultative meetings and in the process of
the revision and development of this guideline, particularly, to the NRMD for embarking the update of the
guideline and for assigning key staff; creating a reliable partnership with stakes to secure resources and
professionals; coordinating and managing several meetings and workshops, and the tireless efforts to ensure
the successful completion of the work.
I would like to thank all organizations and projects, namely GIZ -SURED, GIZ-SDR, SLMP, PSNP, the
World Bank, EU -DAI, WFP, ERCS, Agri -team Canada, World Agro -Forestry Center (ICRAFT), Water
and Land Resource Center (WLRC), and Bybone and the Universit y of the Netherlands from private
companies, for permitting committed professionals to participate in the guideline update and associated
review activities, as well as in the provision of training to regional and woreda experts designed to enrich
the guideline. Regional Experts have made significant contributions to the development of this guideline
through their active participation during various workshops and ToT events, and the NR&FS sector would
like to thank them.
I am grateful to all the contributors, in larger and smaller ways, their name listed in this guideline, who did
a marvelous job in due process and made professional contribution on the different sections of the guideline.
I would like to extend my special thanks to Tefera Tedesse, Abenet Men gistu, Lakew Desta, Beleyneh
Adugna, Amare Mugoro, Aklilu Mesfin and Nesredin Rube. These exceptional professionals led the

FORWARD

The previous guideline has been a comprehensive technical manual in its content and form, even though it
was used for longer periods without any update and was developed in the context of mixed-farming areas,
and misses newly introduced technologies, parti cularly in the planning steps, and some newly introduced
technologies, approaches and important emerging issues related to NRM and Livelihood interventions such
as, climate smart planning, environmental management framework, gender and social development,
codification of watersheds, livelihood technologies, policy and legal issues etc., were the missing or gaps
that were identified during gap assessment and during consultation workshops.

Cognizant of these and other prevailed gaps, the MoA decided to update and develop one national
Watershed/Rangeland development guideline. The update work has gone through gap assessment by
NRMD of the MoA; and a series of technical meetings, consultation workshops and writeshops with the
participation of a number of stakeholders, until reaching the final form and content. The planning steps of
this newly developed Watershed/Rangeland development guideline was tested last year in 2019, in 14
kebeles in seven woredas selected from both mixed-farming and pastoral regions.

The Guideline consists of three parts. The first part describes the background on watersheds/rangelands and
the planning steps with annexes. The planning steps classified into three sections ; (i) planning steps for
Mixed Farming Areas, (ii) planning steps for pure pastoral areas and (iii) common planning steps for Mixed
Farming and Pure Pastoral Areas. The second part deals with interventions and the technologies suitable
for mixed farming areas, and the third part discusses technologies applicable for pastoral areas. Both, the
second and third part, are presented with supporting annexes related to technologies. The draft guideline
was discussed and enriched at various professional forums, dur ing training sessions organized for federal
sector experts (NRM, Livelihood, CRGE, Water Resource, Livestock and Extension); mixed -farming
regions regional and zonal level experts of NRM and Livelihood; Pastoral regions and their respective
woredas of RLM, and edited and fine-tuned by a week-long workshop of key experts and coordinators.

Moreover, there is a plan to translate this Guideline into local and working languages with the active
involvement of the respective regions that would further facilitate  the implementation of watershed and
rangeland development by the rural community. As this national guideline is the outcome of a joint effort
made by all major stakeholders, federal and regional governments and the development partners, we hope
such joint efforts to come up with similar important guidelines in the near future.

This Guideline addresses important developmental activity and the contents give information on how to
plan, design and implement community watershed development/Range land developme nt activities. The
Guideline provides consolidated and normative information for field workers and Wereda experts. The
Guideline has been designed in such a way that important steps are followed by implementers and the
community members are involved right from the inception of the idea up to its implementation and result
based performance assessment.

       PART 1: SECTION A (1)
      SCOPE AND MAIN ELEMENTS

[1]

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Historical background
Watershed management is not a new concept in Ethiopia as it had been intensively practiced by indigenous
people since ancient times. Examples include: bench terraces of Konso, agroforestry practices in Gedeo,
contour planting and in-situ moisture harvesting techniques in Hararghe, and stone terraces in Ankober and
Nadier Adet. Formal government supported watershed management came to prominence after the recurrent
and catastrophic malnutrition and famine problems subsequent to the drought phenomena of the 1970’s and
1980’s. Land degradation resulting from soil erosion has usually been considered as the main driving cause
of the problem. The formal planning process for watershed development in Ethiopia began in the 1980’s
and involved  planning unit s for large watershed development covering  30-40 thousand hectares. The
purpose was mostly to implement natural resources conservation and development programs. But such
large-scale efforts remained mostly unsatisfactory due to lack of effective community participation and
limited sense of ownership. The planning units also proved generally unmanageable.
The lessons learned from this experience encouraged the MoA and support agencies like FAO to initiate
pilot watershed planning approaches on a bottom-up basis, using smaller units and following community-
based approaches. As a result, minimum planning and sub-watershed approaches were introduced.
Minimum planning at the initial stage involved shifting from larger watersheds to smaller sub-watersheds.
These were tested on a pilot basis by MoA with FAO technical assistance in the period 1988 - 91.
Later, in 2005, MoA and its supporting partners (i.e.  AMAREW Project, GIZ, ILRI, USAID, and WFP)
created /issued the Community-based Participatory W atershed Development P lanning (CBPWD)
Guidelines, incorporated into the LLPPA (Local Level Participatory Planning Approach). LLPPA was
designed for Development Agents, as a practical approach to be used for integrated NRM interventions.  It
included productivity intensiﬁcation measures, and small -scale community infrastructure such as water
ponds and feeder roads. LLPPA was at the core of the MoA-WFP assisted MERET project to combat land
degradation and food insecurity in many Woredas of the country. The watershed management efforts started
initially in the highlands on highly dissected and steeply sloping terrain and were gradually moved to the
lowlands.
Consequently, several NGOs, bilateral organizations and donors adopted and supported the participatory
community watershed management approach in the last three to four decades within their respective areas
of intervention and in close collaboration with government partners.
The collective experience involved different approaches, combined with the need to have a common and
standardized more effective approach to the country as a whole . It  gave birth to the First Edition of
community-based participatory watershed development guidelines  in 2005.  This was first prepared in
English and translated into three national languages (e.g. Afan O romoo, Amharic, Tigrigna, etc.) and was
printed, and distributed throughout the country. PSNP’s Pastoral guidelines were also issued in 2012. Since
the issuance of  these guidelines, there has been positive achievement in the rehabilitation of severely
degraded land which is once again becoming a source of income and livelihood support for communities.
The guidelines have been used to support the on -going project and program level implementation of the
watershed management initiatives. Without these it would have been very difficult to mainstream and
expand improvements in watershed management throughout  the country. Accordingly, large tracts of

[2]

degraded hillsides, farmlands, grazing  lands, and gully affected land s have been reclaimed through
application of the community watershed approach. Furthermore, the application  of the guidelines for
cascaded trainings from Federal level to Regions, has resulted in grass-root awareness and the development
of community and frontline staff capacities. There is now a more consolidated foundation of experience
and lessons learned in comparison to what existed before the guidelines were issued.
This doesn’t mean that the current watershed management practices are fully sustainable. Attention must
still be paid to: work quality, spatial coverage, strengthening awareness and capacity building, ensuring real
community participation, and ensuring the equitable and the fair share of  benefits between and among
upstream-downstream communities. However, it has been tested and served for many years and is providing
lessons from past mistakes. From a practical point of view , it requires updating  to reflect  the latest
development dynamics. These include guidelines on; climate smart thinking; updated planning steps; and
the inclusion of additional watershed development technologies and related working annexes.  Above all,
watershed management must be evaluated in terms of environmental soundness, economic viability and
social acceptability.
1.2 Experience of PWDP in Other Countries - Successful Watershed Initiatives
The first generation of watershed management projects in developing countries in the 1970s and 1980s
applied a soil and water conservation approach, which emphasized engineering works aimed at specific on-
site and downstream physical outcomes. Less attenti on was paid to the role and needs of upstream
populations or to their involvement in and ownership of program activities. As a result, investment costs
were high and not always well justified, and the assets and benefits created often had a limited life. By the
end of the 1980s, the comparative failure of this “engineering” approach was clear, and a major rethinking
of watershed management approaches was undertaken.
Many countries, particularly those having signiﬁcant areas with complex, mountainous, and fr agile
ecosystems have developed national watershed programs or projects. The Indian National Watershed
Development Project for Rain fed Areas (NWDPRA) is a major initiative operating in conformity with the
Common Approach for Watershed Development. It was jointly formulated and adopted by the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development incorporating lessons learnt from successful projects, especially in
community participation.
China also successfully practices the concept of small watershed -based development and the case of the
Yellow River (Loess Plateau) is a unique one. The plan  for the management of a small watershed
emphasizes comprehensive erosion control measures including measures for hill -slope and gully
stabilization, regulating river systems and rearranging farmlands. The principles of soil erosion control have
been further developed by combining physical soil erosion control measures with the optimum utilization
of biological measures. Appropriate management and use of degraded watersheds have obviously resulted
in largescale ecological, economic and social beneﬁts to farmers. Various Asian countries such as Nepal,
The Philippines and Indonesia also have remarkable and often large -scale watershed development
programs.
Participatory conservation  and watershed -based approaches have been successfully introduced and
expanded in various countries in Africa, particularly in Kenya, Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali, to name a

[3]

few. Such programs have been realized within the context of combating desertiﬁcati on and poverty
reduction efforts.
Success in testing community -based approaches in several countries, including Brazil, China, India,
Turkey, Yemen, Kenya, and Nepal has led to adoption of broader policies for community-based watershed
management. In other countries, including Morocco and Indonesia, doubts about program performance and
cost have delayed the adoption of national policies. In general, national policies on watershed management
have tended to develop in a pragmatic and iterative fashion, with early setbacks over engineering-dominated
approaches. This being succeeded by tests of community -based approaches and by technology packages ,
targeting sustainable changes in land and water use practices that brought benefit and better livelihoods to
communities and other stakeholders.
Since the 1990s, watershed management programs in developing countries supported by the international
community typically targeted livelihood improvements and poverty reduction objectives in addition to
resource conservation. Operations aimed at these twin targets typically adopted integrated farming systems
and participatory, demand-driven approaches implemented in decentralized jurisdictions. The move away
from planned investments toward farming systems and participatory approaches was designed to seek “win-
win” solutions, but posed two substantial questions: Could the new approach achieve both conservation
objectives and increase incomes? Could a demand -driven program upstream have a positive effect on
downstream conditions?
2. RATIONALE
Watershed development has been problematic when applied in a rigid and conventional manner,
particularly when applied without community participation, using only hydrological planning units, with a
limited range of interventio ns and neglect of post -rehabilitation management aspects. Such interventions
have frequently resulted in failures or had serious shortcomings which were difﬁcult to correct; examples
are to be found in Ethiopia and elsewhere.  The case of Borkena earthen dam in South Wello and siltation
of natural as well as artificial waterbodies in different parts of the country are good examples to show
failures of previous efforts. Other examples in Ethiopia of the unsatisfactory performance of conservation
efforts include the failures of various large size watershed planning initiatives during the 1980s. These top-
down approaches and rigid technical packages clearly demonstrated that poorly planned watershed
approaches can result in complete failure. However, the previous efforts have laid a foundation and served
as evidence-based learning processes for the current integrated approaches.
Hence, watershed degradation has environmental and socioeconomic effects far beyond the more obvious
on-site and downstream impacts. Fo r the same reasons, watershed management interventions may bring
local, regional, and global environmental benefits. However, watershed management programs have tended
to neglect environmental impacts beyond immediate land and water impacts. The quality of implementation
of watershed management practices, particularly those dealing with physical and engineering measures, are
still to some extent nascent but pose a challenge in many places. It may, for instance, be worse to have
improperly planned, designed and constructed /implemented watershed management measures than none.
A degraded watershed o ften results in a substantial increase in vulnerability to disaster risk and climate
change. This is the case when ecosystem services are lost because of environmental degradation.
Deforestation and conversion of wetlands, for example, may cause massive erosion and increased exposure

[4]

to drought, storms and floods. Sometimes well -intended measures result in unintended adverse
consequences and a net increase in vulnerability. This is the case, for instance, when water is diverted
upstream to support agricultu re or hydropower installations, leading to less water downstream, which in
turn can lead to the loss of wetlands and their valuable services to downstream communities.

Acknowledging and understanding the deep interdependency between the use of land and e cosystems,
human well-being, risk patterns, increased variability and unpredictability of weather is at the core of better
watershed management, disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Watershed management may
also play a key role in hazard mitigation and prevention.
2.1 Objectives of CBPWD in Ethiopia
The overall objective of Participatory Watershed Development approach is to improve the livelihood of
community/households in rural Ethiopia through comprehensive , participatory  and integrated natural
resources management. It aims at productivity enhancement measures for improved income generation
opportunities, enhanced livelihood support systems, adaptation to the vagaries of climate changes, and high
resilience to shocks. It h elps to optimize the use of existing natural resources and untapped potentials in
both already degraded areas and in the remaining potential areas in the country.
More speciﬁc objectives include:
1. Conserving soil, rainwater and vegetation effectively for productive uses;
2. Harvesting surplus water to create water sources in addition to ground water recharge;
3. Promoting sustainable farming and stabilize crop yields by adopting suitable soil, water, nutrient
and crop management practices;
4. Rehabilitating and reclaiming marginal lands through appropriate conservation measures and the
mix of trees, shrubs and grasses, based on land potential;
5. Enhancing the income of individuals by the diversiﬁed agriculture production, increased
employment opportunities and cotta ge enterprises, particularly for the most vulnerable, linked to
the sustained use of natural resources;
6. Building resilient landscape and communities by integrating disaster risk and climate change
adaption measures within a broader watershed management practice.
2.2 Objective of the Guideline
The Guidelines aims to build upon existing community-based participatory watershed efforts to harmonize
and consolidate planning procedures at the grass -roots level. The intent is to provide DAs, rural
communities, and  development practitioners with workable and adaptable planning tools, that may be
applied in a variety of circumstances.  This would include: low or high rainfall areas, severely degraded
and food-insecure areas; areas that may be a food secure and not yet seriously affected by land degradation;
or areas dominated by cereal -plough farming or enset-hoe use.  They should be capable of being applied
by men, women or youth.
In this regard, another main objective is also to provide practical guidance on the c orrect selection of
appropriate technologies under different conditions and their sequentially correct implementation. Different
interventions are summarized in planning procedures and included in some detail as packages in the

[5]

Annexes and in other support  documents. Finally, the Guidelines would be used as a reference for
Agricultural Vocational Education Training (ATVET) and Farmer /Pastoral Training Centers (FTCs /PTCs)
theoretical and practical trainings.
2.3 Scope of the Community Watershed Development Approach
Community-based watershed development is seen as the most effective adaptation strategy and mitigation
option, to counter the rapid pace of land degradation, water resources depletion and climate related issues
facing the country. It ensures that wa tershed development planning efforts remain focused, effective, and
efficient and that there is clear definition of the scope of the effort required for implementation.  This is
essential because of the wide variation in the distribution of resources and t he diversity of issues likely to
be encountered, and the fact that watershed development planning is always broad in scope. It also ensures
that land and water management and livelihood improvement are central to the watershed development
planning process.
The term scope is also used to describe the boundaries or extent of a program or project, which can be
defined in terms of space (the area included in the watershed plan) or other parameters.  Hence the title of
this guideline is “Community Based Partici patory Watershed Development Guidelines” which
differentiates it from large-scale hydrological watershed development planning. The community watershed
is used as the reference area and the planning process is based on the integrated management of the existing
natural resources - soil, water, and plants. Under normal circumstance, the optimum size of a community
watershed is 500ha. Nevertheless, in special situations there will be watersheds which will have 250 ha as
a lower limit in highland areas (rugged topographies). Likewise, the upper limit can go up to 1000 ha in flat
and gentle landscapes. The process applied ensures that there is coincidence between the area in which the
community and interactions occur and the scope of decision-making: i.e. that problems are resolved where
they are happening and with the involvement of the affected population.
These guidelines define the scope of community watershed planning efforts not only in terms of the
geographic area to be addressed but also in relation to the issues of concern, the goals that should be attained
and the extent of these. If the scope is too broad, it becomes difficult to coordinate the various initiatives
and make the best use of the available financial and human resources as the watershed plan i s developed
and implemented. If the scope is not defined; the possibility of undertaking detailed analyses is hampered,
there is less likelihood of adequate involvement of key stakeholders and, ultimately, less chance of
successful plan implementation. Too narrow a scope might, however, preclude the opportunity to address
watershed problems and stressors in a rational, efficient, and economical manner. It is advisable to define
the scope and set preliminary goals early in the planning process, which makes it is easier to work through
the later steps in the process. Key stakeholders must provide the critical input into the watershed planning
process which is needed to identify issues of concern, develop goals, and propose management strategies
for implementat ion. Without careful attention to the participatory process, underlying local social or
political dynamics may well derail the intent of this guideline. The implications of existing policies on the
scope and performance of various local institutions must a lso be analyzed to assess their effectiveness in
managing the land and water resources separately as well as for their integrated management.  In summary
therefore, Information from the stakeholders shapes the scope of watershed planning efforts.
The geog raphic scope of the community watershed also affects the temporal scope of watershed plan
implementation. Although there are no hard and fast rules, watershed plans are typically written for a time

[6]

span of 3 to 5 years.  If the watershed goals are not attai ned within 5 -year timeframe, much of the
information might become out-of-date, and it may well be necessary to update the watershed plan.
2.4 Scope of the Guidelines
These guidelines have been produced primarily to guide community watershed planning at the Woreda and
Kebele levels. They may also be referred to and applied by national and regional government workers and
by development partners supporting the implementation of national watershed development planning
initiatives.  They may also be of use to NGOs involved in watershed development projects, who are likely
to have effective communications with the local community. They may also be of use to universities and
scientific institutions.
These guidelines provide advice as to how community watershed plann ing can be carried out in both
highland and pastoral areas. Generally, the Guidelines have four distinctive parts i.e. i) The Background;
ii) The Planning Steps; iii) The Technologies or so called Info-techs; and iv) The Annexes. The latter one
consists detailed working annexes for the planning steps and for the technologies. The background part
includes Introduction; Rationale; Policies and Strategies; and Guiding Principles of CBPWDP. The
planning step part has 8 clearly articulated, detailed steps and monitoring and evaluation. The technological
part includes info -tech packs contained in 14 folders and reaching more than 110 in number. Each
technology is prepared in two or three pages, using standard technology presentation format, to optimize
the size of  the guidelines. Readers who would like to deepen should refer other manuals listed in the
reference, available hard copies, and from web search. The planning steps and the working annexes
combined, provide a handy checklist of recommended actions for carr ying out effective community
watershed planning. The various technologies are each summarized in two to three pages “info -techs”
which provide overview information. For more in -depth understanding of the individual technologies,
readers are advised to refe r to specific manuals as these guidelines are not intended to substitute for the
manuals. The list of manuals, some are given in the reference list, and others could be searched in hard
copies or web search. The guidelines have been prepared for the “Mixed farming areas and “Pure-Pastoral”
areas of the country. These current guidelines are for the first two whilst the later one has also been issued
in separate volumes /parts following similar arrangement.
2.5 PWD as a Foundation for Sustainable Agricultural D evelopment in Rural Ethiopia  -
PWD to Combat the Land Degradation-Food Insecurity-Poverty Nexus
Ethiopia has mostly complex and fragile landscapes. Land degradation seriously affects livelihoods and
food security of millions in Ethiopia and threatens the livelihood of many more. The main land degradation
arises from (1) high soil erosion rates as a result of steep slopes, continuous encroachment and cultivation
of marginal lands; (2) long history of deforestation, overgrazing, negative coping strategies s uch as the
burning of animal dung, extensive use of charcoal, reduced rotation periods, and others. The points stated
above are more elaborated using Figure 1.
Recurrent cycles of drought and inadequate infrastructure have further aggravated the problem.
Consequently, the farming systems that exist in the country are progressively impoverished and more
vulnerable to shocks. These are serious constraints to sustainable development and a main cause of unstable,
over-simpliﬁed and drought prone production systems.

[7]

Therefore, participatory watershed planning and development is a vital necessity in complex landscapes.
In this context interactions, between and within, communities are highly dependent on what happens at
different levels of the watershed. Watershed planning has moved away from conventional land use -
planning exercise to a logical interpretation of the potentials of the land as a function of the needs,
demands and aspirations of the people living in the watersheds , including the interactions between
people’s activities and the land resources. Participatory watershed planning is thus the key to
understanding what needs to be done at various levels to sustain, improve and diversify production while
developing and managing the natural resource base to promote income generation opportunities, increase
access to basic services (roads, markets, schools, water, and the like) and make livelihood systems
resilient to shocks.
Relationship between livelihoods and watersheds in rural Ethiopia:  All over Ethiopia, watershed logic
governs water flow regimes, erosion levels, biomass availability, productivity levels, the quality of
infrastructure and countless other activities. In degraded watersheds, opportunities for water harvesting and
management are few and of limited use, access to clean water for domestic use is often very difﬁcult and
incidence of water-borne diseases is very high. Expansion of road networks without the proper catchment
protection works can have as great an impact on watersheds as farming or herding and access roads may be
continuously damaged where they have been inappropriately located and/or constructed. Road construction
removes vegetation, and may leave the area susceptible to surface erosion. Unstable  watersheds induce
unstable production systems marked by inefﬁciency of input utilization as a result of erosion and the
removal of topsoil, fertilizer, sown seed, compost, and lime by surface flows. This also limits opportunities
to enhance productivity. Moreover, income generation opportunities linked to introduction of cash crops,
bee-keeping, livestock fattening or dairy, and others, largely depend on the conditions or “health” of the
watersheds. They depend as well on the interactions between communiti es and the different levels of the
watershed units. Increased vulnerability to drought and food insecurity is directly linked to the conditions
of the watershed and the limitations of its capacity to support local livelihoods. The opposite occurs with
protected and developed watershed systems, which generate multiple positive effects on people’s
livelihoods, the environment and the overall economy of the area.
Potentials and opportunities linked to PWD: The potential for community-based watershed development
in Ethiopia is huge. This applies both for already severely degraded and food insecure areas as well as for
those areas classiﬁed as food-secure and surplus-producing. One should not be misled by these latter areas
as they are also subject to high erosion and deforestation rates, and mostly in the process of gradually losing
their potential. Even in these areas corrective actions should be promptly taken to reverse degradation trends
and retain and improve their productive potential. The level and types of activities, including technological
interventions, may differ but the same principles and recommendations apply.
In other words, participatory watershed planning should be considered as an instrument - to “bring rural
households back to business” in fo od-insecure and degraded contexts and to “keep rural households in
business” in other areas. Besides, watershed development also enables new opportunities to emerge, linked
to water development such as: diversification of crops, improvement of livestock ma nagement, improved
market access opportunities, land reclamation, fertility improvement, and new off-farm activities etc. Thus,
the watershed, or catchment area, forms a natural framework for resource development in relation to
agricultural production systems as well as for resource conservation and utilization.

[8]

Equally important, PWD is a practical and effective tool for best utilization of the different disciplines
related to agriculture and food security, in a way that they mutually reinforce each other. Natural resources,
inputs and extension, livestock, water and marketing are all connected and can beneﬁt greatly from the
application of a participatory watershed planning framework. Watershed development beneﬁts local
households and farmers, the local community, and the society at large.
Beneﬁts to households:
• Improved surface water retention and moisture availability for crops;
• Improved water availability and quality in streams and storage sites;
• Improved soil quality and fertility retention levels for crop production and diversiﬁcation;
•  better soil structure and drainage;
• Increased access to biomass for multipurpose use (fodder, ﬁrewood, fruits, construction, and
others) and higher proﬁts;
• Increased resilience to climate change shocks and improved livelihoods;
• Increased opportunities for participation in income generation activities.
Beneﬁts to local community:
• Reduced erosion, deforestation, ﬂooding and waterlogging;
• Lower land development costs;
• Enhanced aquifer recharge - more dependable, clean (healthy) water supply for domestic and
industrial use;
• Increased overall agricultural productivity and access to markets and basic services;
• Improved livelihood options, including for the poorest households.
Beneﬁts to the society at large:
• Better conservation of natural resources and biodiversity;
• Less danger from ﬂoods to downstream farmlands;
• Reduced sedimentation of costly irrigation projects and protection of major infrastructure (e.g.
roads, dams, natural lakes);
• Increased water supply and improved health;
• Reduced occurrence of drought, flood and increased stability of production systems;
• Increase to resilience to climate change factors – drought, intense rainfall, floods etc.
2.6 Adaptability of PWD
Participatory Watershed development (PWD) can be adopted to diverse ecosystems to overcome the
challenges posed by land degradation as a result of soil erosion, deforestation, overgrazing, and
inappropriate land use system in general. It should be adapted ba sed on local conditions to increase
resilience and adaptive capacity of communities in the face of gradual shrinking of the ecosystem  and
agricultural production capacity due to climate change induced factors such as drought, flooding, uneven
rain condition, untimely rain, crop & livestock disease, etc.

[9]

2.6.1 PWD in diverse ecosystems
The Ethiopian landscape is mostly rugged and thus also mostly prone to land degradation. Water erosion
in the rainy season and wind erosion in the dry season are obvious threats to agriculture and to ecosystem
services in general. Extremes of both drought and flooding will increase with climate change, making land
degradation an even greater threat to food production and to all ecosystem services.
The 1990s represented a n ew departure for watershed management programs, which in the developing
countries, were supported by the international community. Although engineering solutions were not
excluded where appropriate, the emphasis was placed more on farming/pastoral systems a nd on
participatory and demand -driven approaches implemented at the decentralized local level. Stimulus was
given to this new departure by the renewed emphasis on rural poverty reduction in development programs.
The move away from planned investments towards farming/pastoral systems and participatory approaches
was designed to seek synergies and to limit the need for tradeoffs.
PWD can be applied in almost all contexts but needs to be tailored to local conditions. The approach can
be adapted to suit differ ent sizes of watersheds and accommodate community and Kebele administrative
boundaries. It can also be adapted to accommodate relationships between communities and watersheds as
well as to the application of the various technologies under different conditi ons. The same measure; for
instance a soil bund, requires different design and vegetative stabilization considerations if constructed in
dry weyna dega or in moist weyna dega conditions. Watershed planning for a community located at the
foot of a single hi llside or few hills will be largely different from watershed planning for communities
located under broad mountainous ranges and where the watershed includes complex vertical and horizontal
relationships. The second scenario will need various community-based sub-watershed plans to be prepared
and linked to one another to achieve the intended results.
Adaptability is also required in treating watersheds with the various measures that might be available.
Within a single watershed consisting of many sub wate rsheds there are an almost inﬁnite number of sub -
divisions that may be necessary to identify or manage. There may also be large interactions between large
watersheds that inﬂuence major hydrology and local economies of an area. An example is recharging of
water-tables and protection of feeder roads.
Very small interactions at the micro-watershed level are also important; at the level of a farmer’s homestead
or even between sections of the homestead for example. What can be developed or improved at the
homestead level is often closely linked to what is done on a surrounding larger watershed.  Examples of
this include situations where development of hand-dug wells and small-scale irrigation is now possible at
an individual household level in several Woredas fo llowing systematic implementation of moisture
conservation measures in large watersheds. Small initiatives limited to a few hectares cannot generate such
results. On the other hand, watershed principles must still be applied to the smallest unit of interve ntions,
including in a single plot of land.
Finally, ﬂexibility is needed in the way watershed-planning units themselves are delineated. Planning units
should be community-based (gott, genda, kushet, and others) but speciﬁc watershed units are identiﬁed both
within and outside the community boundaries based upon hydrology and land-use interactions. Quite often,
interventions will need to include more than a single community or kebele. In this case, each community -
based watershed plan will contribute to larger plans and share major interactions and activities with other(s).

[10]

2.6.2 Application and Relevance of PWD in Pastoralist Systems
Watershed management approaches are likely to be most effective on steeper terrain, particularly where
there are problems with both upstream land and water management and with downstream impacts.  In such
situations there are more likely to be demonstrable linkages between upland activities and basin -level
environmental conditions, and upstream conservation measures are likely to ha ve significant downstream
impacts. On the other hand, alternative rural development approaches may be more cost effective where
these upstream-downstream impacts and interactions are not key issues from an investment point of view
and a broader rural development approaches may be a more cost-effective way to tackle upland problems.
PWD as explained in this Guideline is more suited for settled agriculture but can be adapted to suit the
needs of agro -pastoralists and pastoralists. The latter are traditionally  rather mobile along transhumance
(grazing) routes, which are the result of decades of experience and adaptation to climatic and environmental
conditions. Instead of deﬁned watershed units, an “area -based” watershed approach is more appropriate,
where speciﬁc areas along rangelands and transhumance routes, will be developed following watershed
principles and /or settlement patterns. However, at regional, zonal and woreda levels, broad watershed units
should be delineated within which speciﬁc areas are identiﬁed for interventions.  The interventions will be
executed following speciﬁc sub -watershed interactions. The most critical needs are always water and
animal feed. Water development for pastoral areas is commonly seen as a failure because the concentration
of animals results in the rapid degradation of land around the few water points. The strategy should be
directed to create sufﬁcient grazing reserves for pastoralists to use at times of drought and along
transhumance routes. For agro-pastoralists, an entire set of conservation and water harvesting measures can
be implemented to enable them to stay longer in a given location (increased crop and fodder production as
well as access to water supply). Speciﬁc recommendations are provided for pastoralist systems  in several
sections of the planning steps, technological packs and in the Annexes.

3. POLICIES AND STRATEGIES RELATED TO WATERSHED
DEVELOPMENT
3.1 Food Security Strategy (2002)
This is targeted mainly at chronically food -insecure, moisture-deﬁcit and pastoral areas. The focus is on
environmental rehabilitation to reverse the current t rend in land degradation, and to provide a source of
income generation for food insecure households. Watershed based water harvesting and introduction of
high value crops, livestock, and agro-forestry development are new elements in the revised strategy. Since
the New Coalition for Food Security Program was issued, which had the principal objective of promoting
Integrated Participatory Watershed Management Planning and implementation of food -security
interventions, several community watersheds have become o perational in foods insecure Woredas of the
country.
3.2 The Ethiopian Strategic Investment Framework (ESIF) and the Sustainable Land
Management Program (SLMP)
The ESIF were initiated in 2008 to address two of Ethiopia’s most significant developmental and
environmental problems: low agricultural productivity and  land degradation. The SLM is an umbrella
framework for all land management interventions. It was developed on the basis of Paris declaration of aid
effectiveness and through collaboration between international and national stakeholders (Terrafrica, FAO,
GM, WB, GIZ and government ministries). It provides a holistic and integrated strategic planning
framework under which government and civil society stakeholders can work together to remove barriers,
overcome the bottle-necks, and promote scaling up of sustainable land management (SLM) within Ethiopia.
The plan was to implement ESIF in three phases (of 5 years each) over a fifteen-year period starting in 2009
and is continuing until 2023. This framework promotes multi-sectoral partnerships to combat the country’s
prevailing land degradation challenges.  It focuses on the outcomes of:
• Reducing the area of land adversely affected by land degradation;
• Reducing rural poverty and vulnerability;
• Removing the key barriers to secure land tenure/user rights issues;
• Improving knowledge and capacity to use land according to its suitability and capability;
• Enhancing the enabling policy environment for the promotion of SLM at all levels; and
• Ensuring the existence of an effective institutional capacity and operational structure to support
the implementation of the framework.
3.3 Ethiopia’s Natural Resources Policy
Natural Resources provide the basis for the rural and urban environment and are the foundation of the
economy. The objectives of the Natural Resources Policy are to ensure that the ecological processes and
life support systems are sustained, and biodiversity preserved.  It is also intended to ensure that renewable
natural resources are used in such a way that their regenerative and productive capabilities are maintained
and where possible enhanced so that the needs of future generations ar e satisfied and not compromised.

[2]

The policy focuses among other things on: soil husbandry and sustainable agriculture; forest and woodland
management and protection, and on genetic diversity of species and ecosystem biodiversity.
3.4 The Ethiopian National Conservation Strategy
The national conservation strategy was issued in 1994 and takes a holistic view of natural, human -made
and cultural resources and their use and abuse. It seeks to integrate into a coherent whole existing and future
Central and Regional Government planning in all sectors that impinge on the environment. These include:
agriculture, forestry, wildlife, fisheries, soils, water, minerals, energy, urban planning and cultural heritage.
It consists of five volumes, i.e. the country background, po licy environment, institutional set ups, action
plan and investment. Following this example, the regions have also issued their respective policies.
3.5 The Ethiopian Climate Resilience Green Economy (CRGE)
The CRGE was issued in 2011, plans to achieve climate resilient and green middle-income economy status
by 2025 with zero net emissions. It has three complementary objectives: fostering economic development
and growth, ensuring abatement and avoidance of future emissions for transition to a green economy, and
improving resilience to climate change. The strategy is based on four pillars: 1. Adoption of agriculture and
land use efficiency measures; 2. Protection and rehabilitation of forests for their economic and ecosystem
services including as carbon stocks; 3 . Deployment of renewable and clean power generation; and 4. Use
of appropriate advanced technologies in industry, transport, and buildings.
3.6 Engagement in the Construction of Hydro-dams
The Government of Ethiopia is engaged in constructing hydro -dams for p ower generation and irrigation
development. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), for which the foundation stone was laid
on April 2, 2011, is the major element of this, and when completed will generate more than 6,000 MW of
power. In total Ethiopia has an estimated potential of 45 GW (45,000 MW) of hydropower. According to
the information widely available on GERD, of the total of 145 meters effective height (the river bed to the
crest of the auxiliary spillway), 90 meters is set aside for dead storage to accommodate the likely silt load.
With this in mind, it is clearly essential to manage the upper catchments of this and other dams in such a
manner as to reduce silt loads and ensure the sustainability of the investments made in them. Appropriate
erosion control measures must therefore be undertaken in all upstream areas of these hydropower dams
(GERD, Gilgel Gibe I, II, III, etc.). Apart from the negative on -site effects in untreated watersheds (Loss
of fertile soil, moisture depletion, seed and nutrient wash), they pose negative off-site threats: burying fertile
agricultural lands downstream, burying infrastructural facilities, accelerating wear and tear of power
generating turbine blades, suffocating wetlands and contributing to the loss of natural a nd artificial water
bodies by enhancing the development of water hyacinth (e.g. As is happening in Lake Tana and Koka Dam).

[3]

3.7 Watershed and Agroforestry Strategies
The Ministry of Agriculture actively engaged in the process of developing strategies which will
complement the updated CBPWD Guidelines for the mixed farming areas and pure -Pastoral areas of the
country. These strategies will play paramount role in setting strategic directions for addressing some critical
capacity and systematic challenges observed in natural resources management in the country.
3.8 The Ethiopian Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP II - 2015/16-2019/20)
The GTP II issued in 2015, highlights the major achievements, in watershed management, soil and water
conservation works and forest ry development under the GTP I (2011 -2015).  It also recognizes the role
played by productive and organized social mobilization and the increased effectiveness of initiatives
resulting from the active engagement of communities across the county.  It shoul d be noted that this also
inspired and mobilized the nation for Ethiopia’s Green Economy. The priority focus of the GTP II strategy
is on scaling -up and maintaining the momentum of GTP I in all parts of the country. In this regard, the
expansion of small -scale irrigation in tandem with natural resource conservation to increase agricultural
productivity and production has been clearly identified as a means to enhance the economic contribution of
natural resources.

[4]

4. CONCEPTS AND PRINCIPLES OF PWD
4.1 Definitions
4.1.1 A Watershed
A watershed is deﬁned as any surface area from which runoff resulting from rainfall is collected and drained
through a common conﬂuence point. The term is synonymous with a drainage basin or catchment area.
Hydrologically, a watershed could be deﬁned as an area from which the runoff drains through a particular
point in the drainage system (Figure 2).  It includes all the natural resources in a basin, especially water,
soil, and vegetative factors. At the socioeconomic level a watershed includes people, the farming system
(including livestock) and interactions with land resources, coping strategies, social and economic activities
and cultural aspects.

4.1.2 Participatory Watershed Development
Participatory watershed development (PWD) can be deﬁned as “the rational and socially acceptable
utilization of all the natural resources in a manner that achieves the optimum production required to fulﬁll
the present needs with minimal degradation of natu ral resources, including land, water, and all other
elements of the environment.” It clearly recognizes the people’s needs and aspirations drive the planning
process and must therefore be emphasized, and the water supply and management initiatives must consider
the whole watershed as well as the people living within it as a planning unit. Local farmers, other land users

[5]

and the wider community who depend on the land must be involved from the very beginning of the planning
process since they must live with t he end results.  It is essential therefore to emphasize that the adequacy
of planning depends on the human element and not only on the physical or technical aspects. Planning must
start, therefore, with the people living on and depending on the land.
The PWD process therefore recognizes: (a) that as the inhabitants of a watershed depend on it for their
livelihoods and survival, they in turn should be responsible for the proper or improper use of the resource;
and (b) that the key to success in achieving su stainable use of land and water resources  is the full
engagement and participation of the men and women in the proposed project area in the selection of the
various technologies to be applied within the watershed area. This latter includes land improvement s,
rehabilitation, and other technical works as well as measures intended to improve incomes and welfare of
the people. The PWD process must include substantial consultations with the “target population” before
the preparation of detailed project proposals  in the office.  To be effective this requires a mechanism for
establishing priorities and making decisions at the local level. People also need to be informed about
available alternatives and to feel that their concerns are being addressed.  To ensure satisfactory results this
initial consultation and planning process must also incorporate agreement on a system of monitoring and
evaluation to enable the rural people to follow and measure progress made on joint decisions, and to make
changes if necessary. Without the effective establishment of this PWD process it is impossible to create the
self-supporting systems so essential for sustainability.
The concept of PWD and management emphasizes a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional approach for
multiple interventions.  This includes effective use of any form of assistance and community contribution,
as well as the sound management of the assets created. To affect this, Watershed Management Plans
(WMPs) must be prepared in accordance with this Guideline and other relevant and approved documents
such as the Climate Smart Agriculture Manual (and periodic updates). This specifies that WMPs should (i)
cover a five -year period, (ii) indicate SLM practices that will be developed and/or maintained, and (iii)
provide a timeline, budget, and estimated labor and other input requirements.
Participatory watershed development is also intended to generate greater cohesion within the society and
enable its poorest members to beneﬁt from the various assets created and eventually to overcome their food
insecurity.
4.1.3 Integrated Risk Management
Integrated Risk Management (IRM) is as an enhanced, holistic approach to increase community resilience
by integrating disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation and ecosystem management and restoration
within a broad watershed management practice.
4.2 Principles of Watershed Development
4.2.1 Main Principles
Participatory: Watershed communities need to be involved in all stages of planning, implementation and
management of watershed developme nt activities. It is a continuous process and not a onetime exercise.
Different participatory techniques will be used based upon existing and innovative experience.
Gender sensitive: Women are the most affected by environmental challenges; for example, the y need to
walk long hours to fetch increasingly scarce water, ﬁrewood and animal dung in addition to attending

[6]

livestock, to name a few. Their involvement in watershed development planning, implementation and
management is the key to ensuring that they beneﬁt equally from the various measures.
Building upon local experience, strength and what works :  Local knowledge is essential to improve
existing technologies, to adapt new ones and to manage natural resources and other measures once they are
introduced and established. Best practices should be identiﬁed and disseminated.
Realistic, integrated, productive and manageable: Watershed development planning should be realistic,
based upon local capacity, locally available resources and other forms of government and partner support.
Integrated conservation and development of the natural resources base is the guiding principle for watershed
development together with the optimum use of social resources. To the extent possible watershed
development activities should provide tangible and quick beneﬁts to households. This is possible to achieve
if measures are designed to accommodate both production and conservation requirements. Some measures,
however, need some time before the full beneﬁts can be achieved. In this case, the combination of measures
with short and longer term beneﬁts is essential. This can be achieved if quality criteria and integration
aspects of the interventions are met.
Watershed logic and potential respected: Adoption of ridge to valley approach, of manageable size, and
focused on interactions between land uses and their capability.  Simple descriptions of land use and features
helps to identify suitable ranges of technical options to optimize existing land u se or improvements
responding to both biophysical and social requirements. Due emphasis should be placed on activities that
enhance production by optimizing productivity per unit area, per unit time, or per unit of water for both
land owners and landless f amilies.  Emphasis should be given to the role that the quality of physical
structures, vegetative cover and biological measures plays in achieving this.
The reclamation and rehabilitation of degraded and marginal lands, including gullies, will be promoted as
a major activity in most of these areas through application of alternative and productive land-use systems.
In semi-arid and arid areas, specific attention will be given to in situ and off -site water harvesting. For
purely pastoral areas broad watersh ed units should be delineated within which speciﬁc and appropriate
interventions might be applied.
Environmental and Social Sustainability : Watershed management activities should be designed
according to the required environmental and social sustainability  standards and should incorporate
mitigation measures and a designated budget to offset any potential negative impacts to meet the required
standards.
Climate Smart: The approaches and technologies to be pursued should be environmentally friendly and
be able to sequester carbon (reduce greenhouse gas emission) at the same time as increasing the resilience
of communities to weather extremes associated with climate change.
The need for ﬂexibility at different levels : Flexibility and the ability to adjust to prevailing local
conditions (topography, climate, vegetation biomass and social situations) are key criteria for project design
and management under PWD. Flexibility is needed during the selection of community wat ersheds, their
size (whether they are slightly smaller or larger than the ranges indicated) and clustering and during the
steps of the procedures. Similarly, ﬂexibility is essential when considering the choice and design of
measures within the agreed criteria of quality and integration. In pastoral areas, flexibility in applying the
planning unit consists mainly in adjusting to settlement patterns, grazing routs, water resources, etc. There

[7]

is no an exact definition of a “watershed approach” to planning, rather it is a social construct agreed to by
the people living in that watershed. The process is not rigid or cast in stone.
Cost-sharing and empowerment/ownership building : Cost-sharing by stakeholders contributes to the
sustainability of a project and play s an important role in establishing the responsibility of various
stakeholders in the management of the resources. Various forms of local contributions are possible based
upon social networks and group formation mechanisms.
Complementary to food security and rural development mainstreaming (including HIV/ AIDs, health
and education, and others) : To the extent possible, watershed development planning incorporates
additional elements related to basic services and social infrastructure. These activities will all beneﬁt from
their inclusion in the participatory watershed development framework.
Integration of DRR and CCA within Watershed Management: in areas where the watershed is
completely degraded and the ecosystem services are lost, neither reducing disaster risks nor adaptation to
climate change is possible. Given the fact that an enhanced watershed practices would create a strong
foundation for sustainable risk reduction and improved climate change adaptation capacities, integrating
DRR and CCA aspects from the assessment to planning, to implementation and evaluation of watershed
management interventions could even results in better synergy and multiple benefits to the community.
Working across different time scale :  willingness to work across time scales en ables adaptive planning
of watershed management. For many climate related hazards, especially at the most local levels, we do not
know precisely how their frequency, intensity and predictability will change over time. However, we can
design measures robust enough for the change we can anticipate in the watershed and that can be adjusted
over time.
Integrate disciples and approaches within the watershed: local communities living in a specific
watershed could face manifold vulnerabilities that have various u nderlying causes. Addressing these
effectively requires a combination of disciples to analyze risks at all levels and draw up plans and implement
them. These disciples could cover different sectors such as natural resource management, health,
agriculture, water, education, infrastructure, disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and even
disaster response. Efforts should be made at the watershed level to bring these sectors (different
stakeholders) together and ensure their complementarity for better results.
Community self-management: The betterment of the community is determined by its resources and its
knowledge, and whether it can organize itself to mobilize local resources equitably. Empowerment and the
creation of local ownership are essent ial for communities to be in the driving seat of their watershed
development.
Livelihood focused: when a watershed is affected, it has a direct impact on the livelihoods of significant
number of communities. Effective watershed management practice is the one which puts communities’
livelihood at the center of tis focus and shows a clear links between the watershed interventions with the
livelihood benefits it would generate to the community. This could also use to mobilize the community
better.

4.2.2 Size of the Watershed
A watershed may be only a few hectares constituting the drainage area needed for ﬁlling small ponds or, in
the case of rivers; it may cover hundreds of square kilometers. The size of the watershed should be based
on the land-based needs of the community or communities depending on it (i.e. for intensive or extensive
crop production or grazing).  This enables of the definition of a suitable watershed size for effective
planning for conservation and maximum production.  It also provides the basis for efﬁcient management of
watershed resources by defining an appropriate unit size that ensures the resources are managed and handled
effectively, collectively and simultaneously. The average size of the community /micro watershed for the
mixed farming communities should be assumed to be about 500ha with some variations depending on
practical considerations. Some exceptions are to be anticipated above this, particularly in drier areas where
villages are scattered within larger watershed units and where natural resource development is possible only
if larger units are considered. In this case, however, sub-watershed units should be identiﬁed and prioritized
for orderly implementation of interventions. For pastoral areas, however, the size can be adjusted according
to community needs within the Kebele.
As the community and its surroundings is the decision -making unit for any watershed, this is of necessity
as a starting point for planning. Within the size range suggested above, a watershed will be then selected as
much as possible to:
• Include the community or most parts of a community comprising the smallest unit available (gott,
genda, kushet, and others). One kebele may thus have several watershed plans.
• Include more than one community where the interact ions between two or more communities are
closely linked to the watershed they share.
• Include only a portion of a community where it is widely scattered and where there are two or more
community watersheds being occupied by the community. In this case, several community
watershed plans can be developed and linked one to the other (see section 5.8.3 of the planning
steps).
• In cases where a community watershed falls within two or more kebeles, the planning and
implementation shall be executed with a collaborative effort of the concerned bodies of the
respective Kebeles. This also applies for watersheds which crosses woredas boundaries.
In pure pastoral  areas the density of settlement is generally lower than in the highlands. The spatial
coverage of any given Kebele is also and generally larger than in the highlands. Interventions for
management of rangelands /pasture lands are most likely to include: forage development /improvement,
control of invasive species, water harvesting, and the opening/demarcating and mapping of livestock
trekking routs. Pastoralists already have common resource manage ment terminology such as “Madda”
meaning water point and “Dheda” meaning grazing /rangelands.  In (Borana) areas, a group of people living
within a village is known as “Rera” and “Ollaa” is a neighborhood. The water points can be permanent or
seasonal. There are also wet season and dry season grazing areas where livestock are trekked from place to
place depending on seasons. These resource centers may range from a few hectares to very large areas
covering clusters of villages, Kebeles, and Woredas. So, boundaries of these resource centers should not be
taken as the lowest planning unit in the watershed logic. In the pastoral areas, the lowest planning unit may
be the boundary of the community or villages within the Kebele. One Kebele may have two or more
communities where such land and water resources planning can be carried out. The boundary of these
communities may not necessarily fit within a logical and watershed but may encompass all the land under

[9]

the community’s jurisdiction within the Kebele structure. Community level planning can thus be aggregated
at Kebele level.  It is evident from this that for doing watershed -based planning the watershed logic may
not be as easily recognized and applied in the pastoral areas as in the highland landscape. However,  as
connection, aggregation and continuum of communities grows between one or more Kebeles the watershed
boundaries appear to be more clearly defined, with identifiable dividing lines between catchments, and
recognizable water courses and common outlets or water flow confluence points. It is also to be noted that,
due to pastoralists’ highly mobile behavior, it would be difficult to constrain pastoral communities to
smaller size community watersheds for land and water resources planning and management. Comm unity
or Kebele level planning is recommended instead1.
4.2.3 Watershed and community /micro-watersheds: Linkages and Intervention Logic
All watersheds can be divided into smaller community/micro -watersheds. Each watershed or community
/micro-watershed hydrological unit is connected, and any modiﬁcation of the land use in a watershed or
micro-watershed will reﬂect on the water as well as se diment yield of the overall watershed. Watersheds
can be classiﬁed as micro-watersheds, major watersheds, sub-basins and basins.
There is quite interesting resemblance between a tree and a watershed (see Figure 3). A tree can be
explained as leaves leading to small branches and these small branches leading to larger branches and the
larger branches lead to the trunk of the tree. Also, there is similarity between administrative ladder and
watershed as village (e.g. Gott/Kushet), Kebele, Woreda, Zone, Region , and National. So, there is always
intervention logic between the small and larger watersheds and continuum exists. Finally, a whole
watershed treatment means generation of abundance of resources and wealth.

FIGURE 3:THE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN WATERSHED AND A TREE
Linkages: Once the major watershed unit has been chosen, community watershed units can be identiﬁed
within this unit to prioritize activities and their sequences. There are interactions between the major
watershed and community/micro-watersheds that may be extremely important to remember and to consider.
Some are simple and obvious; others are less evident and need to be looked at more carefully. These

[10]

interactions are based not only on how drainage and surface runoff interact but also on land use and socio-
economic factors. Planning Step 5 section 5.8.3 illustrates common situations in the ﬁeld and problems that
may occur when such factors related to watershed management are neglected.
In general terms, a holistic  approach to watershed treatment is required. Although such integrated and
comprehensive treatments are ideal, these may not be possible because of resources or cost -beneﬁt
considerations or because of conflicting local priorities and other factors. By usi ng a ﬂexible planning
approach treatments can still be planned to take place sequentially over time. Sometimes it is only necessary
to apply partial treatment to watersheds.
Intervention logic: The selection and logical sequencing of the different interventions should be geared to
farmers’ interests and by how these can be addressed based upon the biophysical characteristics of the
landscape. Technical support is also needed to help community m embers visualize watershed potentials
and logic. Intervention logic is not only related to the type of activities that should be undertaken
sequentially or simultaneously but also to a number of agreements and arrangements required to
accommodate the inter ests of different land users: what will be done, where, by whom and how. For
instance, a feeder road or a water pond may be a priority for the community. However, without treatment
of upper watershed areas, these two assets may not be sustainable and may e ven be severely damaged.
Those upper sections may need to be closed and planted, which in turn implies sharing arrangements,
control grazing agreements, choice of type of conservation measures to support plantation and control
runoff, choice of species, an d the like. During the selection of measures such interactions will determine
the best sequence to follow and the risks to avoid. This Guidelines and support documents will provide
information on main interactions and integration requirements for various t echnologies and interventions.
The two examples below further clarify intervention logic.
Example 1: Soil bunds may be requested by a group of farmers from a given area, but it may easily happen
that implementation cannot take place because their land is located below a hillside and could thus be
damaged by runoff from the hillside after intense rains. It would then be necessary to involve another group
of land users who have rights over those hills, or to consult the community (ies) if the area is under
communal use rights (such as grazing). In this case, the problems which may be encountered might include:
lack of interest in treating the hillsides, disputes over use rights, different opinions on what measures to
apply on the hillsides, disputes over acce ss to labor opportunities, and other issues. It is only after clear
agreements are reached on what, where, how, by whom and when the treatment of the hillside will be
undertaken that soil bunds become a viable option for that area.
Example 2: In many areas, there is considerable untapped potential for water harvesting. Understanding
the potential of a watershed provides the best indication as to what type of measure to select, for example;
micro-ponds and/or hand-dug wells. Hand-dug wells are more advantageous for small-scale irrigation, but
water-tables may be too deep and have limited ﬂow. In many parts of the country there are frequent
superficial geological fractures, as a result of which shallow aquifers can be recharged and water is available
at depths of 5 to 10 m.  Water-tables may, however, be raised if adequate and signiﬁcant hillside treatments
are undertaken. Trenches combined with other measures such as inﬁltration pits and related measures can
be very effective in this regard. Once such treatme nts are completed, hand-dug wells become feasible. In
other circumstances micro-ponds will be the best choice provided they are also integrated with upper micro
watershed rehabilitation – a combination of the two is often possible depending on the topograp hy of the
area.

[11]

4.3 Watershed Coding
The concept of the tree introduced above (i.e. trunk, large /medium /small branches, and its leaves) provides
a model around which one might approach the disaggregation of a watershed into Basin, Sub-Basin, Major
Watershed, Community /Micro -watershed hierarchies - based on the topology of a stream network.
Hierarchical watershed coding systems have been broadly applied worldwide and various methods for
watershed and stream network numbering developed (for example the Strahle r stream coding order 2).
These systems were all developed for purposes of water and land resources management. A number of
developed countries have coded and documented their land resources locations, potentials, limitations, and
development planning needs on a metric grid, and it would perhaps be timely for Ethiopia to start doing the
same. Using GIS systems, watersheds can be coded providing information on their locations/positions and
their sizes. Such coding systems can also be developed for water and land resources management purposes
at the national, regional, Woreda, and local levels. Standardized coding systems are needed which are
informative, simple to use at the different administrative levels, open, and user -friendly with a clear
relationship between watersheds of different sizes, the main river basins and their tributaries. The Ministry
of Agriculture has recognized the need to pursue the task of coding watersheds in order to achieve effective
watershed management, planning, implementation, prog ress monitoring, change tracking, and impact
studies. Some regions (e.g. Tigray) have already started this by coding close to 7,359 community/micro -
watersheds within the region’s 3 major basins, 23 sub-basins, and 488 major watersheds.
4.3.1 Watershed Codification System
In this system the national territory is divided into major regions composed of sub-regions, which are again
broken into successively smaller accounting units and cataloging units (major and smaller watersheds). The
boundaries of these un its are defined in terms of the topographic divides between river basins, and their
sub-basins and watersheds.  In applying this to Ethiopia we find a watershed hierarchy composed of
multiple levels of watershed hydrologic units.  These consist of: basins, sub-basins, and major watersheds
(covering 6,000-20,000 ha) at Woreda level; and micro/community watersheds with average of 500Ha at
community level in most cases. However, were local conditions compel to have smaller or larger sizes the
lower and upper limit should be 250Ha and 1000Ha respectively.  Often there are smaller watershed units
nested in the larger watershed hydrologic unit for which a hierarchical order can be established. A
hydrologic unit code (HUC) is assigned to indicate region, sub-region, accounting unit, and cataloging unit.
The hydrologic units delineate a nationally predefined boundary, basin and watershed area.
Example: The Ethiopian administrative hierarchy consists of regional, zonal, Woreda and Kebele
administrative units, in which the Region and Kebele represent the highest and the lowest units. Based on
this, the proposed classification and coding system is as illustrated in the three tables below. The following
logic is applied: A watershed code, will include codes for the region, the basin, sub -basin, zone, Woreda,
major watershed, and the community/micro-watershed. The planning steps contained in this guideline was
tested in sample Woredas of the country. One of the micro -watersheds in Amhara Region, Tach Gaint
woreda codified as 03Ab06a06A06a. The interpretation was provided as follows:

4.3.2 Watershed Codification Tool Logical Requirements4

CSM-PSNP project developed the practical codification tool for watershed codification described above
using GIS software. The codification tool should take a standard set of data inputs and automatically
populate all of  the fields in a community level Micro -watershed file. All Micro -watersheds will be


4 Watershed Codification Guidance is under preparation through the support of EU/CSM -PSNP

[14]

processed no matter what their size. A post -processing stage may be required to manually merge o r split
micro-watersheds that fall outside the Guidelines.
The Data Inputs required: River Basins, Sub-basins, Major-watersheds, Micro-watersheds, Region,
Zones, Woreda and Kebele.
Output
The micro-watershed layer’s codification attributes are populated with information from the input layers.
Functional Requirements
The tool should open the Micro-watershed file and cycle through each of the features (micro-watersheds).
Each feature should be tested against the input files to extract:
• The Basin name or code
• The Sub-basin name or code
• The Major-watershed name or code
• The Region name or code
• The Zone name or code
• The Woreda name or code
• The Kebele name or code

The Micro-watershed features should be contained within the higher-level hydrological units, they may or
may not be contained by the administrative units. The basic GIS comparison is intersect. If the Micro -
watershed feature does intersect with the input feature, then the area (in Ha) / proportion of intersection will
be recorded. Each of the values will be stored in a separate field to enable sorting on that field. T he full
combined code will be stored in an additional field.
There are a number of options for the implementation of the codification tool but there is only one that is
both practicable and appropriate which is to use the Python programming language with the GDAL/ORG
spatial library. Note that GDAL/OGR is a standard software library used by many GIS software solutions.
Micro-watershed Field Definition

4.4 Elements and Characteristics of Watershed: Overview
4.4.1 Biophysical (Water, Land, Vegetation)
The elements of a watershed include:
• Climate (temperature, rainfall, and wind);
• Water bodies and streams,
• Geomorphology and geological composition which govern the related topographic features
(gradient and length of slopes, shape and direction and past/current erosion features - rills, gullies,
landslides, etc.) as well as soils and drainage conditions
• Vegetation and land use, including homesteads, cultivated land, grazing land, natural and managed
forest and degraded areas used for various purposes.
Watershed development applies to areas with productive potential as well as those with less potential; both
are not only interconnected but their productivity can also be recovered or improved on with the application
of speciﬁc rehabilitation and management measures.
4.4.2 Socioeconomic
The socio -economic elements and characteristics of a watershed include the population, their farming
systems, social setups, economic activities, land tenure, vulnerability proﬁle, gender, and the like.
Watershed development planning is the principal means of dealing with these variables and it also ﬁts with
the concept of commun ity level planning. It aims to improve the livelihoods of the community.  It is a
democratic process that treats men and women alike.  In this context it embraces the views of various
categories of people in the watershed(s). And although it is intended th at all community members should
beneﬁt from watershed development, speciﬁc attention is required to address problems of resource poor
and vulnerable families and promote the empowerment of women. Speciﬁc initiatives involve:
• Equal participation in planning , wage and employment opportunities for women and most
vulnerable households;
• Preferential allocation to resource poor households of usufruct rights over the common land
resources before starting planning;
• Development of marginal lands assigned to resource poor families and women headed families on
a priority basis;
• Location of water harvesting structures nearer to the lands owned and cultivated by resource poor
families;
• Providing support (assets building) to land poor, landless and labor constrained fa milies through
multiple interventions undertaken through community efforts as solidarity and mutual -help
schemes.

4.4.3 Watershed Degradation Features
Depletion of water resources:  Ethiopia suffers from what is referred as a “recurrent wastage of most of
its rainwater”. With loss of water through surface runoff and soil erosion, thus triggering the whole chain
of negative consequences leading to chronic food insecurity. In most developing countries, only 20 –50%
of total surface runoff is controlled and effectively used. Ethiopia is among them as topography, inadequate
farming practices, and lack of conservation measures hamper water and moisture retention and its efﬁcient

[16]

use. Runoff is the portion of rainfall that does not inﬁltrate into the soil and flows over the surface frequently
scouring it.
Wastage of rainwater occurs: (1) when it does not inﬁltrate into the soil to satisfy the crop water
requirements; and (2) when there are excessive flows over the surface of soils that have lost their vegetation
cover as a result of poor tillage or livestock management practices. When rainwater inﬁltrates rapidly it also
has a high potential to recharge aquifers and, under the right geological conditions, make groundwater
available for small-scale irrigation or replenish springs. The depletion of water resources is directly linked
to the disappearance of vegetative cover and absence of surface protection systems. High runoff also implies
high erosion rates resulting in further soil degradation: lower inﬁltration rates; lo ss of soil organic matter
and nutrients and impoverished physical conditions for rooting. This creates a vicious cycle deteriorating
soil conditions.
Scarcity of water for domestic and livestock use is a major consequence of soil degradation in Ethiopia,
with serious repercussions on health, incomes and quality of life of people. Only 24% of Ethiopia’s
population has access to safe drinking water. There is a close and evident relationship between watershed
conditions and the availability of water: it can clearly be shown that the more watersheds are degraded the
scarcer becomes the availability of water. The implementation of watershed development practices is
therefore the most effective means of ensuring that of surface and subsurface water sources can be harvested
and utilized for both domestic, livestock and other uses.
Soil erosion and land degradation: Soil erosion is one of the most important aspects of land degradation
as it results in the reduction in soil depth, fertility and moisture holding capacity. It is caused by the removal
of soil fine particles as a result of rapid flows of water or wind over exposed surfaces. It is always the result
of exploitative use of the land.  These include: excessive tillage and related poor husbandry practices which
leave unprotected soil surfaces exposed to water and wind; cultivation of excessively steep slopes;
overgrazing, and deforestation, even in closed areas. If land and water resources are not protected against
the forces of erosion, there are many symptoms of degradation that are occurring which are not only visual
but also physical, biological and chemical.
Impoverishment of the vegetative cover : Vegetative cover within watersheds becomes impoverished
when biomass is reduced through its mismanagement and over utilization. In forests this results primarily
from unmanaged deforestation for wood or charcoal; in pasture lands from poor pasture management
practices such as overgrazing and burning of bush and grasslands; and in crop lands from the cultivation of
inadequately protected lands (without contours or terraces or the retention of crop residues).  In all three
cases this leads to increased exposure of the land’s surface results in accelerated wind and water erosion
and reduced soil fertility and may also be exacerbated by climate change.  Without appropriate watershed
management therefore the associated natural resources (soil, water, fauna and ﬂora) are degraded rapidly
and in due course are no longer available for the betterment of humans.
It is clear that without the application of appropriate watershed management practices a vicious cycle occurs
in which reduced vegetative cover leads to degradation of the land resources (exposure resulting accelerated
erosion) inevitably in the depletion of the  water resources (decreased infiltration and recharge, increased
runoff, sedimentation of storage facilities and water distribution infrastructure).  The repetition of this cycle
causes continuous deterioration of the soil, water and vegetation and the inc reased degradation of the
watershed. Unchecked this cycle ultimately leads to desertiﬁcation and the loss of the land’s potential to
sustain life and livelihoods.

[17]

Damage to infrastructure: Absence of a protective vegetative cover results in severe soil erosion, damage
to road networks, increased sedimentation and decreased capacity  of water reservoirs and damage to
irrigation schemes. Given the huge ongoing costs of maintenance and repairs, these can largely be avoided
by following good watershed approach and practices.

4.4.4 Existing and Untapped Potentials for Optimizing Water and Soil use in a Watershed
Water harvesting: includes those measures necessary for conserving moisture in situ and for effective use
of surface runoff.  As such, it is an integral part of watershed development and needs to be seen as a key
element in restoring and enhancing land productivity, supporting the rehabilitation of degraded lands, and
enhancing the development of natural resources. The construction, operation and maintenance of  the
necessary small -scale infrastructure provide income generation opportunities, thus contributing to the
wellbeing of the community. Figure 4 shows how to recognize conservation -based water harvesting
potentials in a watershed.
There is immense and barely exploited potential for production and conservation-based water harvesting in
the Ethiopia’s, highlands and lowlands. Several interventions are listed in the watershed planning
guidelines, information kits and support documents which provide valuable experiences from which to draw
lessons and expand best practices. These need to be expanded.  It is necessary to keep in mind however that
water harvesting practices are only possible where appropriately integrated with suitable soil conservation
and watershed development measures. The correct watershed planning approach for any given area must
also identify which water harvesting measure is most appropriate there.
4.5 Land Rehabilitation, Reclamation and Productivity Enhancement
In Ethiopia degradation can be recorded on all land use categories associated with arable agriculture and
herding but over 60% of the erosion occurs on cultivated lands. Large parts of entire Woredas and regions
are affected and are thus prime areas for implementation of water harvesting initiatives.  Even among these
areas though, there is significant variation with the higher erosion rates being recorded in areas with high
potential for cultivation. This implies a need to establish priorities for the co nservation and protection of
watersheds across the country. There are still vast areas of severely eroded land that could be converted to
productive units for crops, fodder or trees. The rehabilitation of such areas is essential in order to more fully
exploit their water harvesting potential and to protect and enhance their potential to support agriculture,
livestock production or forestry.
Land reclamation interventions may be appropriate where degradation is either very severe or where land
is considered unsuitable for production because it is too arid or affected by other problems such as salinity
and frost. There are also excellent opportunities for reversing such trends by using watershed development
principles. Such interventions may be costly, but the y are often worth than the investment. For example,
use of rainfall multiplier systems (systems for retention of water at the surface in ponds, dams, or aquifers,
and in the soil) for very dry areas (up to 250 mm rainfall) enables food, fodder and tree crops to be grown,
grazing reserves to be developed and dry land forests to be established. Large gully networks can be
harnessed through a combination of vegetative and physical measures, including innovative approaches
such as soil storage overﬂow dams. Overall, the watershed development approach highlights potentials that
exist in every land use and its conditions, even most degraded ones.

[18]

Protection, development and sustainable management of forests: Watershed development also involves
the greening of landscapes, including protecting existing natural forests or reforesting denuded areas with
multipurpose species. This activity has multiple functions, such as increasing access to forest products
(ﬁrewood, forage, fruits, timber, dyes, and gums) and also to  forest related activities like bee-keeping. As
with agriculture in which more stable, productive and resilient systems are highly diversiﬁed, forestry
monocultures, are generally less resilient and offer less opportunity for diversified income generation with
multiple beneﬁts. This is also true in complex landscapes, in which the hydrology and access to water is
more heavily dependent on the composition and extent of forest coverage and the status of re -vegetated
areas. “Money grows on trees” is an express ion used to describe systems that foresee trees and other
planting materials as an integral part of the agricultural system, able to ensure environmental and economic
beneﬁts and stability. In this vision local people, and women in particular, become share holders of the
“green factory”, intended to perform as forests and agro -forestry systems. Nursery areas are part of such
systems and, in degraded and deforested environments, a point of departure to improve and manage
rehabilitated areas in a stable, diversiﬁed and risk-averting manner. Furthermore, revegetation in watershed
development means water harvesting opportunities can be multiplied significantly. In this way degraded
areas can made to generate considerable income as a result of reforestation so lon g as they are supported
by conservation-based water harvesting measures.

[19]


Figure 4: Recognizing People’s and watershed potentials for conservation-based water harvesting
Sustained, long lasting and effective use of rural infrastructure: Well-planned watershed development
can be of immense beneﬁt for feeder roads and other major road networks particularly in fragile and steep
terrain.  Even where major road networks have been established prior to the rehabilitation of the concerned
watersheds, they will in due time beneﬁt from this activity.  In the case, however, of inter-community feeder
roads and mountain tracks, these should be included in the community-based watershed planning from the
design to the management stages. The same applie s to community ponds, larger reservoirs and related
irrigation schemes.

[20]

Promotion of income generation activities; Watershed development is also intended to enable series of
new income-based activities to emerge and expand, taking advantage of the multiple beneﬁts generated by
water harvesting and moisture conservation, increased productivity and diversity of crops, fodder and trees.
Small cottage industries, speciﬁc high value crops, bee-keeping, dairy, fattening, improved packaging and
eco-tourism are but a few options that need to be exploited to increase and diversify incomes, and promote
off-farm and on-farm employment for the poor.
Watershed development and conﬂict resolution : Lack of opportunity combined with competition for
access to scarce natural  resources tends to exacerbate divisions within rural communities. This erodes
traditional social cohesion patterns, provokes uncontrolled outmigration and triggers various forms of
conﬂict over the use of natural resources. Conflict over the use of grazing lands and water points is a typical
case in point. It also needs to such things as the detrimental encroachment onto steep slopes and damage to
downstream areas. Participatory watershed development has a built -in conflict resolution procedure to be
applied during the planning and implementation stages. This depends on building the assets base of farmers
or pastoralists and generating a wide range of new opportunities.  Social conﬂicts may, however, also erupt
as a result of these very same opportunities and beneﬁts. The management of watersheds must therefore be
governed by agreed and functional management structures, incorporating a sound legal environment and
continuous support from technical and social departments within and outside the agricultural sector.

[21]

PART 1: SECTION A (2) PLANNING PROCEDURES AND STEPS
5. PLANNING METHODOLOGY AND STEPS
This Section provides planning steps and procedures that will be applicable to mixed farming system areas
and pure pastoral livelihoods systems. In the former, it focuses on watershed planning methodologies,
procedures and steps which, during their implementation, adhere strictly to the watershed logic and the
principles of CBPWD presented in chapter 4 . In the latter, the CBPWD approach will be adjusted to
consider the livelihoods, environment and settlement and mobility pattern of people living in these areas.
This pl anning process incorporates both human and natural resources elements and recognizes that
comprehensive and integrated natural resource development is a means to the end and not an end itself.
It further acknowledges that the planning must begin with a focus on the human element and be designed
to be fully participatory, gender and nutrition sensitive, and to pay due attention to the issues of
vulnerable social groups. The approach also recognizes women’s significant role and contribution in
natural resource management and climate change adaptation and that men and women may be impacted
differently by the extreme environmental conditions likely to be exacerbated by climate change. Emphasis
is also placed on involving and thus empowering communities so that they have the interest and
confidence to own the processes and are knowledgeable about what technical or management
procedures are likely to succeed and what local resources or external supports are available to them.
CBPWD contributes to the realization o f the wider rural development and food security policies and
strategies including the Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE). Particularly, climate smart agriculture
approach that has three pillars will be considered in planning and implementation: (1) sus tainably
increasing agricultural productivity and incomes; (2) adapting and building resilience to climate change;
and (3) reducing and, where possible, removing greenhouse gas emissions. This concept is now applied to
CBPWD to achieve three key objectives: (i) reducing people’s vulnerability to climate change by reducing
exposure, reducing sensitivity and increasing adaptive capacity (ii) increasing the resilience and
sustainability of watershed development investments in relation to climate change and ; ( iii) supporting
climate change mitigation wherever possible and appropriate.
The CBPWD plan is integrated and diverse, covering sectors ranging from those related to natural resource
management, to irrigation and drinking water supply works, crop and livestock development, rural social
infrastructure and services, and income generating livelihood activities. The planning process, therefore,
requires the involvement of range of technical specialists such as agricultural/ irrigation engineers, road
engineers and economists, agronomists, livestock specialists, foresters, social development specialists,
disaster risk management and early waring specialist, environmentalists etc.
The planning process follows a very important and pragmatic process starting from the initial preparation
of plans at Woreda level to the actual planning with communities involving the following steps:
1) Identification and prioritization of watersheds/rangelands;
2) Pre planning preparation at the community level;
3) Actual planning work including biophysical and socio-economic surveys;
4) Intervention identification, prioritization and safeguard considerations;
5) Approval of intervention plans by the wider community;
6) Organizing the intervention plans; and

[22]

7) Formulating implementation strategies.
Climate change, disaster risk, ecosystem management & restoration, gender and social development,
family planning, nutrition, environmental and social safety issues are mainstreamed into these planning
steps. The details of these steps including, the stakeholders involved and the procedures and tools to be
used are well elaborated in this document. More information on the key tools and concepts for conducting
the planning process is to be found in Annexes Part I and Part III for Mixed Farming Areas and Anne xes
Part 2 and Part III for Pure Pastoral Areas.
The procedures used in assessing community settlement and livelihoods in pastoral areas are somewhat
different to those applied in watershed delineation in the mixed farming system areas. In pure pastoral
areas it is necessary to tailor the approaches used in the conventional watershed management approach
to account for variations in terms of settlement, environment and livelihoods.  In this context watershed
delineation may not be relevant or practical, given the settlement pattern and topography of the land.  It
is still possible, however, to determine the smallest planning unit and apply watershed approaches such
as participation of the community, and many other CBPWD principles.  Based on present experience, the
choice of activities is likely to focus on factors that are important to pastoral livelihoods such as: grazing
land rehabilitation, water point development and rehabilitation, control of invasive species, and SWC
schemes forming part of rangeland ma nagement. Flexibility is generally required to ensure that the
various activities planned and implemented in pastoral areas are consistent with local conditions.
The planning process  involves use of various participatory techniques to promote local partic ipation.
These originate from different methodologies which have been widely applied globally. In Ethiopia, they
originate largely from the Local level Participatory Planning Approach (LLPPA), Participatory Rural
Appraisal (PRA), Farming System Development (FSD), and Participatory Land Use-Planning (PLUP). These
techniques are designed to ensure involvement of the whole community in the exercise, while also
enabling the planning team to obtain as much information as possible within the limited time availabl e.
In general, participatory watershed/pastoral area development planning is designed to be as simple and
practical as possible, so that one or more Development Agents (DAs) and the community can prepare a
plan together.
Finally, it needs to be emphasized  that this guideline and the planning approach outlined in it, including
the methods and the tools and instruments presented, are widely applicable throughout Ethiopia.  It
considers all situations from settled to pastoral areas, from highlands to lowlands , and from drought -
affected food-insecure areas to high -potential land areas in which the natural resources are at risk of
deterioration. The guideline is intended to be used as a planning tool for all programs and projects dealing
with, sustainable land m anagement, food and livelihood security or rural development. These include
regular government programs, donor funded ones, or projects being executed by NGOs. The eight
planning steps presented in this guideline result in the formulation of a comprehensiv e Multi-Year Plan
(MYP). This will usually continue for three to five years each selected micro -watershed and require the
production and implementation of a detailed annual action plan each year.
The planning steps are presented in three sections. Part 1 ( section A.1): Mixed farming planning steps
(steps 1 to 3), Part 1 (section A.2): Pure Pastoral planning steps (steps 1 to 3) and Part 1 (section A.3)
Common planning steps for Mixed farming and Pure-pastoral areas (Steps 4 to 8). Each of these sections
are presented as follows: -

[23]

PART 1: SECTION A (2)-1 MIXED FARMING AREAS
PLANNING STEPS
Community based watershed development in mixed farming areas involves eight inter -linked planning
steps. This section presents the first three planning steps as it applies to these areas. Namely: Step1: Getting
started at Woreda level, Step2: Getting start ed at community level and Step 3: Socio -economic and
biophysical survey.
5.1 STEP 1: GETTING STARTED AT WOREDA LEVEL
Community is at the heart of any development
planning including watersheds. However, they
need guidance and direction from higher level
administrative bodies.  Thus, Woreda as
responsible for all communities within the
Kebeles under its governance is responsible for
some key activities that involve into CWDP. Some
of its key activities include: (i) stakeholders’
analysis, establishing planning teams, undertaking
some preparatory activities and initial visit to the
communities. These are presented in detail in the
sections below.
5.1.1 Stakeholder Analysis

As a first and key step in the planning processes  stakeholder analysis considers the identification of
stakeholders and partners (government sector offices, NGOs, private sector, etc.) who have a stake in
watershed management, & management of natural resources and rangelands in pastoral areas.  Before
starting the planning process, it is therefore essential to identify and define the roles and responsibilities of
the key stakeholders. This must include those: (i) who make and implement decisions, (ii) who are affected
by the decisions made, and (iii) who can assist or impede implementation of the decisions.  A preliminary
discussion should then take place with them to establish their involvement in, and commitment to, the plan.
It is important to note that stakeholders are more likely to become involved if  they are shown a clear plan
for their engagement and the benefits of their participation.

Key stakeholders include: communities as main beneficiaries of the plan, communities negatively affected
by the plan, government sector institutions/offices, NGOs, project and programmes and others. It creates a
collaborative and integrated approach for planning as it have high potential for joint efforts, creation of
synergies, sharing of knowledge and experiences and avoiding of duplication, etc.  It would also in clude
those who can provide technical input and assist with resources for planning and implementation efforts,
and those who are good at resource management and conflict resolution. The nature of stakeholders varies
based on their influence and importance for the planning and implementation of the plan. For example,
those who make decisions on resources such as release of finance for implementation of the plan has more
importance and influence than others. Thus, identifying stakeholders based on their influ ence and
importance is crucial for the successful implementation of development plans.  The Woreda Office of
Agriculture (WoA) in mixed farming areas is responsible for initiating and coordinating multi-stakeholder
involvement.
Step 1: Getting started at Woreda level
• Stakeholders Analysis
• Establishing Woreda Watershed Team
(WWT)
• Undertake Woreda level preparatory
activities
• Establishing Kebele Watershed team
(KWT)
• Undertake initial visit to communities

[24]

5.1.2 Establishing Woreda Watershed Team (WWT)
This section highlights preparatory activities at Woreda level that ensure proper planning and
implementation of CBPWD. These include: identification of stakeholders and partners, collection of basic
Woreda data on disaster risk and earl y warning information, food insecurity hot spot area and weather
information, organizing WWT for mixed farming areas and WRT for pastoral areas, setting preliminary
goals, delineation and codification of watersheds and reconnaissance visit to communities.
There should be a “Core 24Woreda Watershed Team (WWT)”, composed of experts assigned by Woreda
Offices of Agriculture and other Woreda line offices, to support and provide follow -up on work and
technical issues. Additional experts can be assigned by the Woreda to further strengthen the WWT in
response to the extent of planning in various Kebeles, the range of activities being undertaken, and the level
of integration required. The team leader for the WWT team will be assigned from NRM process on merit
basis, and the Woreda office of agriculture will take the overall leadership role and facilitate the activities
of the team. Under ideal conditions, the WWT is composed of the following experts:
 TABLE 7: COMPOSITION OF WWT
No. Expert
1 Soil Conservation Expert
2 Forestry/Agro-forestry Expert
3 DRM and Early warning expert
4 GIS specialist
5  Agronomist (plant management, IPM)
6 Water Harvesting /Irrigation Expert;
7  GSD (Gender and Social Development) Expert
8  Livestock Expert
9  Land Use and Administration Expert
10 Food Security/livelihoods Expert
11 Cooperative/Marketing and Inputs Expert
12  Rural Road Engineer
13 Sanitation and nutrition expert

The WWT will have the following functions:
i. Collect and analyze secondary information on disaster risk (prevalent hazards, vulnerabilities,
exposure and local coping capacities) and early warning information, food insecurity hot spot area
and weather information
ii. Participate in the selection and prioritization of community watersheds;
iii. Identify major interactions between community watersheds - ensuring coordination between
Community Watershed Teams and DAs during planning, implementation and M&E for those areas
where there are watershed clusters or common watershed boundary situations (micro/community
watersheds, sub watersheds, major watersheds, broader territorial units, and others);
iv. Organize the events: orientations, experience sharing and training for developm ent agents/
community facilitators – where applicable, and community representatives in watershed planning
and implementation;
v. Provide technical support to Development Agents/Community Facilitators during plan preparation;

[25]

vi. Provide technical support, espec ially on use of technologies (such as application of Google earth
map, GPS and tablets for planning) as well as in estimating and quantifying the work volumes and
resource requirements for agreed interventions that are to be included in multiyear and annual plans;
vii. Collect and review watershed development plans, prepare aggregated plans, and make use of the
plans for developing/upgrading Woreda strategic plans;
viii. Assist in mobilizing and coordinating resource requirements (from the community, government,
external support, and others) for the implementation of plans;
ix. Assist in screening environmental and social impacts of the identified and prioritized interventions;
x. Identify key stakeholders and devise ways to maximize their involvement;
xi. Coordinate additional technical support from various levels (Woreda, zone or region) and partners
as required;
xii. Prepare proposals for linkages/synergies/networking with other relevant institutions and sectors
xiii. Ensure that participatory result -based monitoring approaches are institutionalized and functional
both at Woreda and community level, and that the plans are reviewed by DAs and communities
annually
xiv. Assist in proper documentation and dissemination and netw orking of watershed area development
activities in the Woreda.
Note: Where there are insufficient numbers of Woreda experts for their fulltime assignment to the proposed
initiatives, the respective Woreda Agriculture Ofﬁce is expected: (1) to arrange the schedules of the existing
experts to ensure their availability; and (2) to identify mechanisms for capacity building through the
provision of technical training. In this regard, the suggested minimal technical support team considered
sufﬁcient for participatory watershed development consists of:
1 Soil Conservation Expert;
1 Agronomist (plant management, IPM);
1 Water harvesting /Irrigation expert;
1 Livestock expert.
1 Disaster risk management and early warning expert
Tasks related to forestry and simpl e feeder roads will be handled by the soil conservation expert. The
agronomist will provide support on issues related to nutrition related activities, farming inputs and
marketing. The technical support team members will also deal with overall food securit y issues as they
occur. This composition of a minimal technical support team is considered as temporary and SHOULD
NOT be followed in Woredas that already have these staff as part of their normal WWT.  This minimal
team composition is then only permitted in areas with limited manpower availability. As soon as additional
manpower becomes available, steps should be taken to achieve the standard composition.

5.1.3 Woreda level preparatory activities
In view of the functions described above, the WWT/WRT has to finalize the pre-planning tasks required at
the Woreda level. The major preparatory activities are as described under the headings (i) to (vii) below:
(i) Collection of Basic Woreda data: The starting point for any developmental planning should  be an
initial level of situation analysis on disaster risk (hazard, vulnerability, exposure and coping capacity)
and early warning information, food insecurity hot spot area identification and weather information.
This will guide the WWT in terms of defining focus areas and setting preliminary goals. This analysis
can be done based on secondary data available at various level such as central statistical authority

[26]

(CSA), Woreda risk profile, weather information from metrological sites and use of another rel evant
tool.

(ii) Set preliminary goals: A fundamental step in selecting and prioritizing watersheds in mixed farming
areas and sub-kebeles in pastoral areas is to agree on the long -term development goals for the whole
area under consideration during planning. These goal(s) will be refined throughout the planning process
to represent the shared goals of all the stakeholders. Concrete objectives with measurable targets and
indicators will then be developed with which to measure progress through subsequent discussions with
communities and other stakeholders.

(iii) Identification and mapping of major watershed and sub watershed units in the Woreda for mixed
farming areas: The WWT will begin with marking major drainage courses (consisting of
rivers/streams, other drainage lines, and any other relevant topographic features) using 1: 50,000 scale
topo maps and the collective knowledge of the Woreda experts.  They will demarcate major watersheds
(which may vary widely in size from 6,000 to 20,000 ha), and which can also be divided into sub -
watershed units (each ranging from 2,000 to 6,000 ha). These units may contain one or more Kebeles
and several communities. The Woreda-level prioritization of the sub watersheds should also be in
accordance with priorities established by the WWT. The principal criteria used by the WWT in selecting
the sub watersheds should include:
• The position of the sub-watersheds within major watershed (starting in upper sections of large
watersheds);
• The levels degradation (specific watersheds in a Woreda may be more degraded than others);
• Levels of food insecurity (to decide what options are appropriate);
• The levels of protection required;
• The specific objectives (water conservation, flood protection, major reclamation, etc.);
• Manpower and resources availability;
• Level of vulnerability and associated risks - climate change mitigation and adaptation
objectives.

A combination of most of the above criteria will usually be used to select the broader units (major and sub
watersheds) within which the community-based watersheds will be identified.
Box 1: Relevance of major watershed units:
The concept of major watershed units is highly relevant as these often represent areas which are important
from both hydrological and socio -economic standpoints.  These units may include several interacting
communities (1 or sometimes 2 or 3 Kebeles) with their respective sub-watersheds and micro-watersheds
that belong to a common and strongly linked watershed.  They may consist of broader watershed units,
clusters, or other combinations of these in which it is envisioned that a logical and achievable set o f
initiatives can be undertaken.  These must be sustainable and have significant impact in terms of the
resulting increases in productivity and development of the natural resources base for a defined number
of strongly interdependent communities.
Although the scope of the Guideline is to provide DAs and communities with a workable planning tool
at community level, the goal is to achieve the complete treatment of these watershed units through the

[27]

systematic and logical treatment of each of the small er community watershed units and through this to
achieve multiple and mutually reinforcing results.  It is suggested that, at least at a higher strategic level,
this approach be systematically embedded into a more robust classification and coding system as
explained in the next section,

5.1.4 Establishing Kebele Watershed Team (KWT)

For better coordination of community/micro-watersheds within sub-watersheds, a Kebele-level watershed
team (KWT) must be established by bringing together selected members from each Community Watershed
Team (CWT). The composition of the KWT will include: the (1) Kebele Chairman; (2) Kebele manager;
(3) three DAs and the head  of the Kebele office of agriculture; (4) one male representative/leader of each
community (gott, kushet, genda); (5) one female representative/leader of each community ( gott, kushet,
genda); (6) a youth representative; (7) a Kebele land administration expert; (8) a coo perative agent; (9) a
health extension worker; (10) the school head;  and (11) a private sector representatives (if any).
The role of KWT will include the following
(i) liaison between Kebeles and sites for those activities that need to be undertaken on a priority basis
and completed through joint efforts;
(ii) Coordination between all the community/micro - watershed sites belonging to a common sub -
watershed for specific activities of common interest and benefit.
(iii) Ensuring that community-based planning is organized in each community watershed;
(iv) Setting priorities based on needs and watershed logic
(v) Coordinating interventions that concern more than one community or two Kebeles;
(vi) Responsibility for resources allocation;
(vii) Assisting in targeting and quality control;
(viii) Settling disputes and provision of support on specific issues such as land certification;
(ix) Providing overall guidance on watershed management
(x) Assisting communities in monitoring and evaluating, compiling reports, training and organization
of field days and experience-sharing within and between Kebeles
(xi) Holding progress review meetings once every two weeks;
(xii) Resolving conflicts between adjacent micro-watersheds/Kebeles.

5.1.5 Kebele level preparatory activities

i. Identification of community watersheds  within broader units : Each of the prioritized sub -
watersheds (2,000 -6,000 ha) can be further subdivided, based on community locations, into
community/micro-watersheds having an area of about 500 ha.  Wherever possible, the watershed should
include the selected community area and one or more of the villages if they are small and scattered.  The
communities are sometimes demarcated by narrow and steep sided sub -watersheds lying in gorges or
gullies. The same may occur between Kebeles. The “community/micro-watershed” should still follow these
boundaries for major community planning purposes as they fulfill the “ridge to valley” logic of
interventions. The DA and the community watershed team should, however, also mark the sub -watershed

[28]

boundaries outside the co mmunity/micro ones for those measures that need both the communities’
involvement (for example to treat the gully). Some examples of this are provided in the following pages
These planning steps at this level should remain flexible and practical. Normally, a community/micro -
watershed will include most, if not all, of one community area (gott, and the like). There may, however, be
cases where it is better to group two communities together to form a community watershed. This is
recommended when there  are strong linkages between the communities which also have common sub -
watershed boundaries.
NOTE: Watershed planning is a BINDING ELEMENT for community planning in mixed farming areas.
In other words, each DA should develop Kebele and community plans with interventions designed based
on watershed interactions and potentials. This should be done for each Kebele and community by
delineating and understanding watershed and sub-watershed influences within and outside the Kebele and
community boundaries. These influences are from: (1) upper ridges; (2) the treatment of adjacent sites; and
(3) downstream effects and overall outcomes. From a socio -economic perspective, this means that each
community development plan will include interventions based on the application of watershed planning
principles and logic. From a coordination and intervention perspective, it means that Woreda experts and
DAs will identify which activities should be implemen ted to treat their respective portion (s) of sub -
watersheds based on the agreements with the various gots/kushets/gendas or Kebeles.

ii. Prioritizing community/micro -watersheds with respect to resources : It may be necessary to
prioritize the micro-watersheds depending on the resources available for implementation (e.g. financial
budgets, Woreda manpower and logistics, etc.). In this instance, the community/micro-watersheds can
be arranged in priority order using a combination of the following parameters: (i ) agro -ecological
diversity; (ii) agricultural potential; (iii) watershed logic and sequence (location/orientation in the upper
reaches of the broader watershed); (iv) severity of land degradation and encroachment; (v) food
insecurity and support activities; and (vi) similarities of hazards and vulnerabilities (including origin of
risks) to disaster risk and climate change

iii. Community watersheds, administrative and socio -economic units : The following are common
scenarios of watershed and community interacti ons where a given community or gott/ kushet/genda
may be: (a) Exactly located within a specific sub-watershed; (b) Include part of its land within one sub-
watershed and the other part with another one or more sub-watersheds (for example where divided by
a stream or gorge); (c) included as part of the larger sub-watershed (for example in the lower portion);
or  (d) in a combination of (b) and (c).
Scenario a.  It is the easiest and simplest case.  In this, specific interventions for water development, feeder
roads construction and the like may require the involvement of one or more adjacent communities. The
treatment of other adjacent community watersheds might enhance recharge of water tables, protect
infrastructure and reduce runoff and flooding reaching downstream areas. In this situation, the DA and the
WWT should recognize those potentials and plan for additional community watershed plans.
Scenario b.  This happens quite commonly in the field.  Here, community/micro -watershed plans might
include two or m ore parts of sub -watersheds that must be shared between adjacent communities lying in
relatively higher and lower elements of the watersheds. Figure 6 shows one broader unit, which includes
two community/micro -watersheds. However, the administrative line ( boundary) dividing the two

[29]

communities follows a river and does not overlap the sub-watershed line except in the upper ridges. In this
case, there are elements of the watershed that lie within the boundaries of community No 2. The two
planning units can be  delineated by identifying both types of boundaries.  In this case the community
watershed plans for each community may include activities that fall outside their community boundaries
but within the physical boundaries of the watershed they inhabit.
Scenarios c and d. These are represented in Figure 7 and may seem complicated, which they are, as the
way they interact, and the watershed logic are not clear. All the three communities have interactions with
each other – some more than others.
Community watershed relationships – Example A

FIGURE 2: COMMUNITY WATERSHED RELATIONSHIPS – EXAMPLES A & B
As indicated in figure 6, communities 1 and 3 largely depend on the treatments undertaken by Community
2, which is in the  upstream portion of the watershed. Community 3 has two sub -watershed areas, one of
which is shared between the three communities.  Community 1 is likely to benefit the most from the
treatment of the watershed areas of communities 2 and 3 as it is in the l owest lying portion of the whole
watershed It will have higher water -tables that allow for construction of hand -dug wells and will have
greater availability of water for irrigation and domestic purposes.
It is more likely, however, to need flood protecti on of lower lying agricultural land and settlements. This
illustration shows the need to identify and understand the interactions between sub -watersheds for each
community. This example also indicates something of the priorities governing when intervention s should
be undertaken.  Obviously, the priority is the treatment of Community 2 watershed, which will then create
suitable conditions the appropriate for downstream treatments.  There are also, however, specific micro -
watershed and sub-watershed activities that can be initiated before the treatment of the upper watershed is
completed.

[30]

Community watershed relationships – Example B

FIGURE 3: COMMUNITY WATERSHED RELATIONSHIPS – EXAMPLES A AND B

These examples are intended to facilitate community planning and accommodate watershed principles
within community areas and administrative units. In all circumstances Woreda experts and DAs should
indicate where the village boundaries lie within the boundaries of the sub-watersheds. This also means that
there could be series of plans for two or more adjacent communities to satisfy watershed interactions and
logic.
NOTE: The WWT may not be able to delineate each community watershed with enough precision but can
probably delineate the broader/major watershed units and a first draft of community/micro-watersheds. The
final community-based/micro-watershed planning units will be determined only after reconnaissance visits
at community level.

iv. Identification and organization of DAs’ tasks

The WWT should undertake the following tasks to ensure that the DAs can competently fulfill their
responsibilities with respect to watershed planning and data management of the required sub -watershed
initiatives.
• Meet DAs to discuss pre -selection of major and sub -watersheds and community/micro -
watersheds: The WWT should take advantage of regular monthly or quarterly meetings with DAs
to explain the watershed development planning principles and request DA’s assistance in
discussing the position of Kebele and communities within their respective micro-watersheds.
• Undertake the training of DAs on community based participatory watershed dev elopment
planning steps and technologies. DAs may have broad understanding of the concepts of watershed
development planning but may not possess sufficient skills in mapping, socio -economic and
biophysical assessment, risks and climate smart analysis of in terventions and the other necessary

[31]

technical skills related to specific measures that need to be undertaken.  In such instances, training
should be organized at Woreda and training materials be provided. A specific area and community
could be selected for practical exercise.
• Organize materials and equipment: for both training and surveying/planning work it is essential
that the following items be available:
• Teaching aids: for example, enlarged copies of watershed sketches highlighting micro- macro
interactions, enlarged maps of the Kebele and sub -watersheds (if available), stationery,
planning modules, etc.;
• All the necessary annexes for biophysical and socio-economic survey;
• GPS for geospatial data collection;
• Copies of the info-tech document;
• Clinometers for slope measurement;
• 1:50,000 scale topo-maps for sketching (both soft and hard copies);
• Measuring tape and/or string for distance measurement;
• Line levels and range poles; and
• Other items of relevance

v. First visit at community level
Reconnaissance visits at Kebele and Community level and validation of pre-planning work. This work
is undertaken by the WWT together with the DAs of the selected Kebeles where the broader watershed
units have been delineated and prioritized. Some sub -watershed units may be already identified and
prioritized but need to be checked and validated in the field by the WWT based on such criteria as: location
of watershed, level of degradation, level of food insecurity, potential for change, level of vulnerabilities to
risk and climate change, coping, adaptation and mitigation potential, and the presence of other key intended
objectives and resources. The delineation/boundaries of the micro -watersheds should be verified and
corrected.
First discussion with Kebele/community leaders and DAs. The WWT and the DAs should introduce and
explain watershed management principles to the Kebele leaders and representatives.  This should include
explanation of the intervention logic and provide some concrete examples of typical watershed interactions
such as: flood control, drought mitigation, water-table recharge, and spring development, gully control, etc.
The community representatives should be allowed to reach conclusions on what constitutes the important
watershed interactions based on their own experience in the locality.

Using topo-maps and visual references discuss the following items with DAs and Kebele leaders:
i. The major watershed within which Kebele is located - draw/verify boundaries of the Kebele and see
how much they overlap with the major watershed – discuss major watershed interactions between
Kebeles if there are any of relevance;
ii. Proceed to the field and delineate the location of gotts/ kushets/gendas within the broader/ major
watershed units;
iii. Traverse the watershed and locate each of the relevant sub -watershed units within the major
watershed unit  - for each community/ gott/kushet/genda mark the sub -watershed or several sub -
watersheds within which the community is located;
iv. For each community discuss and mark the main watershed interactions (upper, lower and adjacent)
for upcoming planning work ( this step is very important as the WWT together with the Kebele

[32]

leaders and the DAs must identify preliminary key treatment requirements that may involve one or
more communities);
v. Also, with the DAs and Kebele leaders, visualize the various potentials and logical sequence of
activities needed to rehabilitate the whole area;
vi. Risk patters and weather changes in the watershed (including where risks could originate and reveal
itself)
vii. Hold a final meeting with the Kebele leaders and the DAs to discuss the next steps for planning and
prioritization of communities based on watershed logic and other criteria established above, and to
organize the Community Watershed Teams (CWTs);
viii. Discuss and prepare a supervision plan to assist DAs during planning work;
ix. Prepare enlarged watershed maps identifying major watersheds, sub -watersheds and community
boundaries - leave one copy of the map with the DAs and the Kebele leaders.

At this stage, the major watershed unit within which each of the sub-watershed units are located should
have been identified and the different community boundaries delineated. Each community/micro
watershed development plan should include both the socio -economic dimension of t he whole
community and its area as well as the watershed dimensions, both within and outside the community
boundaries.

5.2 STEP 2: GETTING STARTED AT COMMUNITY LEVEL

At this stage, m eeting the community and call for a general
assembly will be the first activity. The DA will start from the
community having the greatest priority in the watershed area
identified during the WWT planning process described above.
Together with Kebele leaders, the DA will introduce the
relevance of watershed principles and management issues to
the community.  This presentation will include an explanation
of sub-watershed interactions and some of the results of land
degradation including: topsoil loss resulting in low
productivity; reduction of landholding size; incidence of droughts; flood damages; the disappearance of
springs, perennial rivers and forest coverage; and any other issues that may be locally relevant.

The discussion will then focus on the importance of watershed planning in broad terms. This should include:
water harvesting possibilities; the available physical and biological measures; forestry options; the benefits
of improved agronomic practices and sound utilization of agricultural inputs; potentials for small
infrastructure development, and other related issues.  It is important for DAs not to raise expectations and
to limit the discussion or any commitments to topics on which they all fully competent and which are within
their mandates. If the members of the community/target group are not convinced, they should not be
pressured to agree to what is being suggested or recommend ed. “Try again” should be the motto. There
may be cases where two communities/gotts/kushets/gendas may agree on joint actions if their areas are not
too large and they form a common sub -watershed area. This will facilitate planning work between
communities sharing small watersheds (a few hundred hectares).
Step 2: Getting started at community
level
• Call for general assembly
• Establish CWT
• Establish KRT or Sub-kebele rangeland
team
• Agree on timing for planning

[33]

Emphasis must be placed on the need to involve both men and women and the views of both should be
sought. It is crucial for technical staff to show good manners and to be respectful and friendly, avoiding
any type of coercion or demonstration of superior attitudes. Farmers and households in general should be
made aware of the participatory nature of the methodology. It is important to emphasize to both the men
and women land users that they will be the fin al decision-makers and that the selection of measures will
take place together with them based on feasible solutions and local constraints.
Once interest raised, the community should be asked about: the area in which initiatives are planned and
the reasons for their selection; and the interactions between their community and others located upstream,
downstream and adjacent to their community. Before ending the general meeting, the community should
be informed that all members are welcome to participate in the planning process.  As it is difficult, however,
to deal with each member of the community individually, the recommendation should be made for the
community to elect a dedicated and representative planning team (see below). In all circumstances, during
field surveys the elected watershed team must meet community members, either as individuals of groups
(based on specific interests).
The need to form a representative CWT:  Each community/gott/kushet/genda should select a planning
team to deal with watersh ed planning issues both within the community boundaries and outside them
especially where there are major interactions with other communities.  As mentioned above, where two
small communities wish to join forces, they can create a combined planning team. T he community
watershed teams should consist of both men and women, including representatives of youth, community
leaders and other relevant stakeholders.
A representative CWT should be elected to provide constant communication between the DA, the
community and the target group.  The composition of this should take into consideration local customs and
practices. It may be possible to have one team, or in some instances two gender -based teams may be
necessary. The composition of CWT involves consideration of three key issues: Gender, wealth status, and
geographical representation.
• The formation of gender balanced CWT  for the whole community is obviously the recommended
option. This has the advantage that where problems are encountered, solutions and responsi bilities
implementing them are identified jointly by men and women and are shared.  Different approaches
may, however, be used based upon cultural norms and planning unit composition.  In some instances,
it is necessary to establish ‘women only’ assemblies .  This happens where cultural barriers hinder
women’s free participation in community meetings or, interfere with their ability to discuss activities
that benefit them.  Such assemblies enable women to explore and discuss their work burdens and ways
to re duce them. Women’s needs should be included in the planning phase of all the different
interventions.
• Geographical representation: It is essential to ensure that the team includes representatives from
villages in the upstream, middle and downstream parts of the watershed.
IMPORTANT NOTE: The role of the DA is crucial where cultural barriers inhibit the participation of
women. In case of a joint watershed review (WR) exercise involving both men and women the DA should
intervene on a regular basis to ensure that the women participate and express their views. It may be useful
in some instances to have a subsequent and separate meeting with the female members to confirm and refine
the WR findings.

[34]

After the WR exercise has been performed with the community and a realistic profile obtained of the social
status and assets of the community members they should be asked to elect 12 people's representatives,
drawn from among each of the main social groups, to form the “CWT”. Of the 12, half should be women
who not only represent different social groups but are also influential and outspoken.
In general, the community should elect a CWT that includes:
• Four male heads of household representing different so cial groups (including vulnerable
households) living in different parts of the community/micro-watershed;
• Two females from male headed households living in different strata of the community;
• Two females from vulnerable and female headed households living in different strata of the
community;
• Two youth representatives, one male and one female;
• Two more (one male and one female) as required by the community (innovative farmers/agro -
pastoralists, respected/ influential people, women's group, or other representative groups).
Note that the CWT will elect one Team Leader and one Secretary.
Functions of the CWT:
• Serve as a permanent contact with the DA, the rest of the community/target group and local leaders
during planning, implementation and monitoring and evaluation;
• Actively participate and cooperate with the Woreda experts, and DAs during identification of problems
and opportunities, priority setting, overall plan preparation processes and during implementation;
• Ensure the liaison with other neighboring communities located within the broader watershed unit;
• Initiate and seek administrative and technical support from responsible organizations for the legal
establishment of Community Watershed Users Association (WUA);
• Coach and maintain awareness of farmers during all steps of planning and implementation;
• Facilitate access to labor and material contributions agreed with the community and make these
available, as and when required, in accordance with the plan;
• Participate in identifying and selecting a community facilitator who meets the minimum requirements
established for this assignment;
• Consult and get consensus from the community for establishing a community wide watershed
management by-law;
• Identify and facilitate formation of various economic user groups to sustainably manage and use
resources of the watershed;
• Ensure equitable use of created community assets arising from watershed development and
rehabilitation activities;
• Address grievances of the community in the event that benefits are not equally and equitably shared
and that this leads to conflicts among beneficiaries;
• In case that the CWT is unable to address these grievances, they should be referred to the Kebele
administration;
• If still unresolved by the Kebele Administration submit the case to the Woreda NRM desk for their
review and a decision; and
• Initiate and work with the concerned entity for the establishment of the WUA.

[35]

Note: The CWT will serve only until the establishment of a legal community watershed users association
(WUA). Once the latter established, duties and function of the CWT will transit to the executive committee
of WUA. Additional roles and functions of the WUA is described under step 8.
5.3 STEP 3:  SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND BIOPHYSICAL SURVEY IN MIXED FARMING AREAS
This is an information -gathering step, designed to characterize the
watershed and the people living within its boundaries. It involves: a
watershed resource inventory and assessment, including current land
uses and any associated risks and problems; definition of the socio -
economic situation of the community; definition of watershed
potentials, opportunities and l imitations; and prioritization of core
problems and solutions. The information gathered in this step
provides the basis for identifying and prioritizing the interventions to
be implemented in the watershed. This is also a critical step for
integration of disaster risk and climate change issues, which must be addressed in the analysis to inform
disaster risk reduction and climate-smart planning and mainstreaming of GSD and nutrition issues.
The approaches and tools to be used for socio -economic and biophysical survey/analysis of community
watershed are provided as follows:
5.3.1 Socio-economic survey

Participatory community and sub -watershed description : The CWT and the DAs will proceed with a
community and sub-watershed familiarization exercise. Community boundaries and major features can be
identified using simple sketching techniques such as, (1) participatory mapping and (2) transects.  These
will be used to describe the principal biophysical conditions and interactions of the people with the various
levels of the major sub-watersheds. These two exercises provide useful information about land resources in
the sub - watersheds and facilitate the assessment of the internal and external opportunities for proper
watershed development as well as the major issues and  limitation that may hinder this. For example, the
existence of land features shared with other communities that may require special remediation such as:
gullies, steep hillsides, and other problematic features. The DA should transcribe these maps to paper  for
future reference and discussion.
Mapping and Survey Methods (transects and simple mapping approaches)
Participatory mapping: The tools for technical mapping are presented in the guidelines - Annexes Part I
and II Socioeconomic and Biophysical Survey  Tools for mixed farming and pure pastoral areas
respectively, sections 1.1 and 1.3. Mapping and transects are complementary to one another.  Both make
use of the farmers’ “mental maps” of the area which makes it easy to: identify available resources, asse ss
infrastructural elements and access to them, and even to identify wealth/social groups and relationships.
They also stimulate discussion and debate. Participatory mapping, in particular, promotes interaction and
helps in the villagers to visualize using their “mental maps”.  The team has first to determine the type of
map it wants to draw. It can be: a social map (social services, health status of individuals, population and
housing); a natural resource map (forest, water, wildlife, village use of n atural resources, fields and land
use, soils, water resources, etc.); a risk map (which shows the various hazards, vulnerabilities, exposure and
available coping capacities) or a spatial arrangement of a house, and the use of space by different social
groups.
Step 3: Socio-economic and
Biophysical Survey
• Participatory Rural Appraisal
tools
• Socio-economic Assessment
• Biophysical Survey

[36]

Participatory transects : A transect is a cross -section or straight -line traverse, cutting through the
community/watershed to capture the greatest diversity or ecosystems, and land use. Transects can be
geographical, historical, or based on other crite ria. A geographical transect is a diagram of principal land
use zones. It facilitates the comparison of the main features such as the, resources, risks and problems of
different zones. Historical transects are simply time lines that cut across time (see the following sections).
The most useful or suitable transect line can usually be identified on a map. A transect walk should involve
careful observation and semi-structured interviewing with villagers met during these walks.

i. Problem identification (PI) and ranking . Following the ground mapping and transect exercises, the
CWT and the DA should carry out the problems and risks5 identification exercise.  The purpose of this
is to identify the most important problems and risks of the com munity and target group(s) as well as to
accomplish preliminary assessment of possible solutions.  Two or more problem and risk identification
exercises may be undertaken based on gender commitments or following the interests of different land user
groups. The CWT should attempt to prioritize the most urgent needs, risks particularly to those related to
agriculture, natural resources and water developments (tapping them at every stage).  No promises should
be made at this stage and the priority should be on identifying solutions that can be handled by the farmers
and community members themselves. Annexes Part I and II, section 1.2 includes basic procedures for the
PI exercise.
The PI process should start in a positive setting with the discussion of the peop le’s vision for change or
how the community would like to see the development of their area.  Then proceed to discuss what the
constraints impede the achievement of that vision.  In this manner participatory watershed management can
become a solution-oriented approach.  Still, it is very important that the problems and risks are carefully
defined in the first step of the planning process and that they are accompanied by a set of workable
solutions/options. Problems are generally recognized as: biological (pests, animal diseases), physical (water
logging, landslide), environmental (drought, deforestation, soil erosion), economic (lack of credit),
institutional, social or cultural factors, but there may be others.
In defining problems and risks, it is important to keep in mind the need to:
1. Distinguish problems and risks from causes and effects
2. Distinguish between symptoms and problems and risks
3. Identify and understand the Interactions between problems and risks (one risk could lead to another
one).
There are four types of ranking commonly used in participatory planning – preference ranking (ranking by
voting), direct matrix ranking, pair -wise ranking and wealth ranking. The pair -wise ranking tool is
explained in Annexes Part I & II, section 1.2.
ii. Community level socio -economic survey : The problem and possible solutions identification
should be supported by more in -depth socio-economic surveys and diagnosis. The following sources of
information and methods may be used to undertake this survey.
iii. Review of existing reports: Existing reports on general socio-economic conditions of the Kebele
and community should be collected and reviewed before planning detailed studies in any specific


5 A problem is a matter or situation r egarded as unwelcome or harmful and needing to be dealt with and
overcome. While a risk is a probability of facing danger or crisis.

[37]

community. The existing reports, which may be available at Woreda or higher levels, will provide the
planning team with basic information, which may be valuable for the preparation of survey proposals and
the related forms and questionnaires.  It is important therefore that existing studies be carefully reviewed.
Avoid repetition of previous work - households are usually tired of being asked the same questions over
and over again, particularly when changes in rural areas are often slow to happen.
iv. Socio economic surveys provide the baselines for M&E: The subject of socio -economic surveys
is likely to include a vast array of social conditions and economic activities in a watershed. Before
beginning the survey, a series of decisions should be made on: enumeration approaches, types of baseline
data, sampling methodology, total  sample size, period of survey, and any other relevant factors. For
practical purposes a complete module, including a socio-economic questionnaire, is attached as Annexes
Part I & II,  section 1. 4. This can be used as a reference for planning purposes. Howe ver, different
procedures and questionnaires both can be used for PI and socio-economic surveys based on consideration
of local conditions, skills and manpower.

The socio-economic survey and constraint analysis should be conducted with the CWT following a defined
checklist divided into subject areas. The questionnaire covers the general community background, crop
production, livestock production, fuel supply, wate r supply, infrastructure, marketing, land degradation,
role of women in development, land tenure, risk patterns (expanding, changing and emerging risks) and
others. Each section should be analyzed in the community and with the CWT. DAs and the CWT should
understand the reason for and importance of each question, particularly in relation to the linkages between
the different components of the farming system, the watershed and the community, and the problems of the
target group.

Primary data collection and analysis tools and participatory tools suggested in this guideline include: the
resource/village map, transect walk, seasonal calendar, historical profiles/time lines, proportional piling or
pie chart, institutional analysis, vision of change exercise, participatory problem identification (PI) and
ranking, contextual gender analysis, and socio -economic interview checklists for semi -structured
interviews.

v. Resource/Village map
A resource map includes information related to natural resources, suc h as village land areas, land uses
(farm, forest, settlement, grazing, etc.), catchments/watersheds, water sources (e.g. ponds, rivers, springs),
etc. In participatory rural appraisal (PRA), a resource map is used to establish a dialogue between: different
groups of the community; between the community and the PRA team; to construct a picture of different
groups of the local environment; to document access to, and control over resources; to create a baseline
reference for use in further discussion; and to i dentify problems, resources and potentials of a given area.
The village mapping exercise promotes interaction and helps visualization of the villagers’ “mental maps”.
Participatory mapping is also a good starting point for identifying important livelihood  resources in the
community, and for discussing the hazards affecting the community.  These may be particularly weather -
related but may also include other hazards and how people are currently responding them. This provides a
basis for further discussions on livelihoods and climate linkages.
How to produce a village map.
• Choose an appropriate site from which the CWT can see most of their area;

[38]

• Decide what sort of map should be drawn (social, natural resources, farms, climate related hazards,
etc.);
• Choose a suitable medium for the maps (ground, floor, paper) and marking device (sticks, stones,
seeds, pens, pencils, chalks);
• Ask the CWT to sketch the selected map of the community and major watershed units on the ground
or on a flip chart – the simplest way to do this is to draw a map on the ground using sharp sticks
and other simple materials such as stones, pebbles, straws, etc.;
• On this map record the main land uses based on CWT’s perception  of the value in terms of
productivity, and as basic community assets (e.g. drainage lines, villages, cultivated lands, grazing
land, bush land, waterlogged areas, homesteads, schools, religious structures, input stores, health
posts, road, foot paths, markets, mountain peaks, lakes, streams, etc.);
• Select a volunteer who knows the area and the purpose of the mapping exercise, and who is willing
to share his/her knowledge;
• Help the people get started but let them draw the map by themselves - be patient and don’t interrupt
- consider it their map! - sit back and watch but facilitate the process.
• Ask participants to indicate the location of the following elements of the map using symbols
o Settlement areas and critical facilities in the community – not necessarily every house, but the
general area where houses/villages are located, and also facilities such as FTC’s, cooperatives,
churches/mosques, health clinics, schools;
o Identify and locate community and household resources important to their livelihoods, -
including forested areas, SWC works, closed areas, irrigation scheme s, farmlands, crops,
erosion gullies, water bodies (ponds, dams, and springs), water harvesting structures, the
grazing lands etc.
o Hazards, vulnerability and exposure mapping (which hazard strikes where) identification and
mapping – start this after the community members have agreed that the map is representative
of their community;
o Important weather and non -weather-related hazards af fecting livelihood resources -
participants should identify and list hazards related to floods, forest fires, mass movement of
animals, human activity (e.g. deforestation) from other watersheds and market areas that
aggravate or reduce the impact of the hazard (where possible indicate the location of these on
the outer boundaries of the map).
o Other factors outside of the community boundary that aggravate the effect of these hazards –
to be done after other hazards have been located on the map – if necessary , assist the
participants in responding to this.
• Allow men and women to do their own map, even if they belong to the same planning team;
• After the map is finished stand around and discuss it;
• Make sure that appreciation is expressed about the work done an d endeavor to trigger discussion
around resources, assets, access, degradation level, institutions, etc.;
• Keep permanent records on paper including the mappers' names to give them credit - A photograph
of the map is a good way to document it;
• A map showin g locations affected by climate hazards can be overlaid on the community village
map (See Annexes Part I & II, figure 1.1 on Example of Village Map).

vi. Transect Walk

[39]


A transect is a cross -sectional traverse cutting straight through the community/watershed to capture the
greatest diversity of ecosystems, and land use. It is used to compare the main features, resources, uses and
problems of different zones. Suitable transect lines are usually first identified on a map. A transect walk
should then involve careful observation and semi-structured interviewing with villagers met during walks.
Procedures of a transect walk exercise:
• Divide the watershed into three parts: upper, middle and lower (If it is small and homogenous
dividing into two parts may suffice);
• Make sure the cross -section captures the greatest diversity of land uses, and other features that
might help in the observation of as much biophysical diversity as possible in a short distance;
• Divide the group (planning team) into two or three and add any available knowledgeable people of
the village to join the walk;
• Ask the group to finalize their drawing after completing their walk;
• Ask each group should make a short presentation about the transect;
• Ensure that the facilitator takes appropriate notes and proper drawings of the transect (it helps in
this to understand the biophysical conditions);
• Brainstorm with the planning team about what they have observed in each land unit and ask them
about solutions and opportunities - while discussing these refer to climate hazards identified in the
participatory map and ask how people are currently responding;
These procedures not only help to internalize the problems and priorities but to:
• Foresee the development options for each land unit;
• Better understand the different components of land resources and the processes associated with
them and to interlink process of land degradation, with land management and productivity loss;
• Help the planning team to discuss different opportunities available to them and to realize the land
management initiatives that should be undertaken under different sets of conditions (i,e, what
should be done where) –  Refer  Annex, Part I & 2, Annex 1 for mapping diagrams; and finally
• To identify areas affected by climate hazards such as extended droughts and floods or erosion due
to heavy rainfall

vii. Seasonal Calendar
The seasonal calendar deals with temporal variations of activities over the year.  This is useful in exploring
linkages/connections and identifying problems, risks (which risk is high at which season) and opportunities
in development works. It is also help ful in identifying the community’s slack periods so as to prepare
appropriately timed activity action plans for watershed development interventions. It can also be used to
analyze seasonal changes in activities and periods of stress or scarcity, to identif y important livelihood
activities, to document community observations of changing trends in seasonal patterns, and to highlight
the increasing uncertainty associated with climate change.
vi. Historical profiles/Trends Analysis
This tool reveals important info rmation for contextual understanding of situations in the community (e.g.
the causal link between land rights and deforestation and erosion). It provides a summary overview of the
key historical events in the community and their importance within the conte xt of the present situation. It

[40]

also helps to provide insights into trends of disaster risk, climate change and the associated intensity of
related events.  This opens the opportunity for dialogue on the need for climate resilience through improved
watershed management and improved crop and livestock husbandry practices.
vii. Proportional piling or pie chart
This is useful for quantifying proportions of a whole, particularly where: absolute values of the whole may
be difficult to calculate (e.g. household expend iture); or where participants may be unwilling to give
quantities (e.g. numbers of livestock). It is a useful tool for investigating the division or relative importance
of various components e.g. crops grown vs total land, soil types vs total land, land use vs total land, income
vs sources, income vs expenditures etc.
viii.  Institutional analysis
Venn Diagrams (also called a chapatti diagram or institutional diagram): these diagrams show the key
institutions and individuals in a community, their relationships and their importance in decision making.
This is an important tool for identifying and und erstanding the different perceptions of power or group
relations within the community and between the community and outsiders, it can also be used to identify
constraints, e.g. the absence of an institution, means the lack of service.
The procedures of institutional analysis using the Venn diagram are as follows:
• Ask farmers to make a list of all organizations that they know;
• Then ask the farmers to draw a large circle to represent their area;
• Ask them to prepare a circle for each organization;
• Then to place the organization circles near the circle representing their area;
• When farmers have finished the drawing, ask questions such as: why some organizations have
strong links; why some organizations are more important; is the development agent/community
facilitator represented; and what is their relationship to the community, etc.

ix. Vision of change exercise
Dream: This is the exercise in which the planning team is allowed to dream about what would they
like their village to be if there were no limitations?
Realization: This is the exercise in which the planning team selects those activities that they can handle
within the existing set of conditions (i.e. and outside the context of their dreams). At the end this
facilitates the identification of priority intervention areas and major problems.
Advantages of dream and realization
Dream:
• Helps communities to imagine what seems impossible but what may in fact be possible;
• Opens people’s minds to change;
• It helps them to be creative;
• It facilitates good participation.
Realization:
• Helps to develop mutual trust;

[41]

• Helps to understand opportunities and major constraints;
• Helps to assume the different intervention areas (or development options);
• Helps to set priorities and understand entry points.
5.3.2 Detailed biophysical survey and mapping

Detailed biophysical assessments and land use/watershed maps complete the above exercises. Mapping
should be undertaken using 1:50,000 topo maps or sketch maps for this purpose.  Technologies such as
GIS/GPS can be used for mapping boundary delineations. Additionally, secondary data analysis should be
undertaken if and as necessary.
Mapping work:
1. Boundaries and sub-watersheds: Maps can be prepared using simple techniques (see Annexes Part I &
II, section 1.5 for detail description).  They should start with the delineation of the community boundaries
and the sub -watersheds within and outside the community boundaries. Each identified sub -watershed
should be divided into community/micro-watersheds and each micro-watershed assigned a number for easy
identification.
2. Land use, topography, soils and past erosion : The information required for the preparation of a
community watershed plan should include at least:  data on the climatic and ecological conditions; the name
size and location of the watershed; the delineation of its boundaries; its general elevation; and where
possible, relevant data on soils, risk locations, geology and geomorphology. Drainage patterns should be
analyzed, with respect to stream density order, and channel profile. The watershed conditions in each land
use unit must be assessed and described using simple survey methods (see Annexes Part I & II, section 1.5)
with respect to: topography and slope gradients; soil depth, texture and stoniness; vegetation; drainage; land
use; water resources; and infrastructure
Since erosion is a major problem in most watersheds, the collection of erosional data becomes a very
important part of the overall survey. The past and present human activities causing the watershed
degradation should be described and are likely to include: cultivation practices – particularly on steeper
slopes, deforestation, overgrazing and heavy trafficking by livestock, road construction, quarrying etc. The
types of soil erosion that are occurring (sheet, rill, gulley, wind, fluvial, mass movement etc.) and the coping
strategies adopted by the local inhabitants should also be identified as these unlikely to provide a starting
point two understanding what measures may ultimatel y be successful and for prioritizing watershed
reclamation and management options.

5.3.3 Synergies of biophysical and socio-economic survey results: analysis of focus
areas and priorities

The foregoing studies including the transect walk, mapping exercise and inventory of resources results in
the identification of the existing the watershed potentials, opportunities and limitations for future
development.  Based on this the DA and the CWT should then analyze the relationship between the
identified problems, the socio-economic survey results, and the biophysical resources .  This analysis
will help to identify and prioritize the short, medium, and long-term community-based initiatives that might
contribute to resolving the watershed use and management problems  and subsequently contribute to their
achieving food security and improved livelihoods and socio-economic conditions.

[42]

This exercise will result in the production of a large -scale BASE MAP on which could be placed all the
information identified above.  The  most suitable scale for this community map would be in the range of
1:2,000 to 1: 5,000. Farmers’ maps and transects should be also recorded on paper, or digitally, for later
reference and for comparison with the base maps. At the end of Step 3 a general meeting should be arranged
with all community members to present the results of the work achieved thus far. The presentation should
be made by the CWT(s) and the whole community should be encouraged to participate in the discussions.
This provides an oppo rtunity to revise the relative urgency of the problems identified and the priorities
previously assigned to them.
The general meetings at this stage are useful because:
• They either confirm the problem identification and the preliminary solutions and priorities
proposed by the watershed planning team(s) or provide a community-based rationale for changing
these;
• They provide the whole community with the opportunity to acce pt or suggest changes to the
planning work achieved so far;
• Confirm that the work undertaken thus far by the planning team is in accordance with the ideas and
aspirations of the different community groups;
• Involve as many people as possible in the planni ng exercise to ensure greater community
empowerment and encourage active community participation;
• Engage women and reinforce the importance of gender issues in the watershed development
planning.

[43]

PART 1: SECTION A (2) - 2 PURE PASTORAL PLANNING
STEPS
Pure pastoral areas exhibit different socio-economic and biophysical characteristics than the mixed farming
areas entailing the need for contextualized watersheds/rangelands development planning steps. Planning in
these areas also involves eight inter -linked planning steps. This section presents the first three planning
steps in the context of these areas. Namely: Step1: Getting started at Woreda level, Step2: Getting started
at community level and Step 3: Socio-economic and biophysical survey.
5.4 STEP 1: GETTING STARTED AT WOREDA LEVEL
Community is at the heart of any development planning including
pastoral area watersheds/rangeland development activities .
However, they need guidance and direction from higher level
administrative bodies.  Thus, Woreda as re sponsible for all
communities within the Kebeles under its jurisdictions is
responsible for some key activities that evolve into pastoral area
rangeland and other community development plans . Some of its
key activities include: (i) stakeholders’ analysis, establishing
planning teams, undertaking some preparatory activities and initial
visit to the communities. These are presented in detail in the
sections below.
5.4.1 Stakeholders Analysis
This is the first and key step in the planning processes. It involves the  identification of stakeholders and
partners (government sector offices, NGOs, private sector, etc.) who have a stake in rangeland management,
& management of natural resources in pastoral areas.  Before starting the planning process, it is therefore
essential to identify the key stakeholders. This must include those: (i) who make and implement decisions,
(ii) who are affected by the decisions made, and (iii) who can assist or impede implementation of the
decisions.  A preliminary discussion should then take place with them to establish their involvement in, and
commitment to, the plan. It is important to note that stakeholders are more likely to become involved if they
are shown a clear plan for their engagement and the benefits of their participation.

Key stakeholders include: communities as main beneficiaries of the plan, communities negatively affected
by the plan, government sector institutions/offices, NGOs, project and programmes and others. It creates a
collaborative and integrated approach for plan ning as it have high potential for joint efforts, creation of
synergies, sharing of knowledge and experiences and avoiding of duplication, etc.  It would also include
those who can provide technical input and assist with resources for planning and implemen tation efforts,
and those who are good at resource management and conflict resolution. The nature of stakeholders varies
based on their influence and importance for the planning and implementation of the plan. For example,
those who make decisions on resources such as release of finance for implementation of the plan has more
importance and influence than others. Thus, identifying stakeholders based on their influence and
importance is crucial for the successful implementation of development plans.  The W oreda Pastoral
Development Office (WPDO) is responsible for initiating and coordinating multi-stakeholder involvement.



Step 1: Getting started at Woreda level

5.4.2 Establishing Woreda Rangeland Team (WRT)

Pastoral Rangeland Management (PRM) requires an integrated approach that seeks to improve the
wellbeing of the pastoral community as well as the sustainable management of natural resources; it therefore
requires the involvement and commitment of various disciplines.  Hence, there should be a group of core
team “Woreda Rangeland Team” (WRT) for these areas that guides the woreda development. It comprises
team of experts assigned by Woreda Pastoral Development Office and other woreda line offices, to support
and follow -up work and technical issues. Additional experts can be assigned by the woreda to further
strengthen the WRT depending on the extent of planning, the range of activities, the result of stakeholder
analysis and integration required. The team leader for the WRT team will be assigned from NRM or
Rangeland Management Process (equivalent to the NRM process). The W oreda Pastoral Development
Office will pull in relevant sectoral line offices and take the overall leadership role and facilitates the
activities of the team. The WRT Leader will be responsible for the day-to-day activities of the team. Under
ideal conditions, the woreda core team is composed of the following experts:
1. Soil & water Conservation expert
2.  Rangeland Management Expert
3. Livestock Expert
4. Forestry/Agro-forestry Expert
5. Water Harvesting /Irrigation Expert
6. GSD (Gender and Social Development) Expert
7. Land Use and Administration Expert
8. Food Security/livelihoods Expert
(Economist/Socio-economist/Agro-economist)
9. Cooperative/Marketing and Inputs Expert
10. Rural Road Engineer
11. DRM/Early warning expert
12. Representatives from relevant stakeholder analysis as required
The WRT will have the following roles and responsibilities:
▪ Identify and prioritize major problems within the Woreda such as prevalence of invasive species,
floods, drought and degraded rangelands disaggregated by Kebele.
▪ Participate in the selection and prioritization of manageable planning units of community
rangelands within the kebeles and then areas for i ntervention (based on agreed set of criteria e.g.
prevalence of invasive species, water scarcity and level of degradation of rangelands etc).
▪  Identify major inter community rangeland interactions within and between Kebeles. Ensure
coordination taking pla ce between Kebele Rangeland Teams (KRTs) /DAs during planning,
implementation and M&E for those areas that need forming logical continuum both within and
between Kebeles (the later representing a broader territorial unit e.g. rangelands crossing Kebele
boundaries);
▪ Closely support and ensure the planning and implementation of activities in the community
rangelands as planning unit still adhere to watershed (ridge to valley) logic as much as possible
since watersheds and flow of water exists in every landsc ape including those in the pure pastoral
areas;
Note: In case, where there are
insufficient numbers of Woreda experts
available, the WRT should be organized
with the minimum number of experts
available that can cover the responsibility
of missing ones. Besides, the WoPD
should support the team in allocating the
necessary budget, transportation and
office facility as required.

[45]

▪ Organize the events: orientations, experience sharing and training for development agents/
community facilitators – where applicable, and community representatives in participatory
rangeland development planning and implementation;
▪ Provide technical support to Development Agents/ Community Facilitators during plan preparation
▪ Provide technical support especially on use of technologies (such as application of Google earth
map, GPS/GIS and tablets for planning) as well as in estimating and quantifying the work volumes
and resource requirements for agreed interventions that are to be included in multiyear and annual
plans;
▪ Collect and review Kebele level participatory rangeland development plans, prepare aggregat ed
plans, and make use of the plans for developing/ upgrading woreda annual and strategic plans;
▪ Assist in mobilizing and coordinating resource requirements (from the community, government,
external support, and others) for implementation of the plans;
▪ Assist in screening and implementation of mitigation measures environmental and social impacts
of the identified and prioritized interventions
▪ Identify key stakeholders and devise ways to maximize their involvement
▪ Coordinate additional technical support from various levels (zone, region and federal) and partners
as required
▪ Prepare proposals for linkages/synergies/networking with other relevant institutions and sectors
▪ Ensure participatory result-based monitoring approaches are institutionalized and functio nal both
at woreda and community level, and that the plans are reviewed by DAs and communities annually
▪ Assist in proper documentation and dissemination and networking of Rangeland development
activities in the woreda
In line with its delegated functions above, the WRT needs to finalize the key pre-planning tasks required at
the woreda level. The key preparatory tasks include: Basic woreda data collection, setting preliminary
development goals, identification of   Kebel es and communities needing special support, preparation of
maps of the community rangelands, training of development agents/ and community facilitators, and
ensuring the required materials and equipment are secured for surveys and planning work.

 5.4.3 Establishing Kebele Rangeland Team (KRT)

Coordination between Kebele and communities requires the formation a Kebele Rangeland Team (KRT),
by bringing together members from each community rangeland Teams  (CWT) (to be established on the second step) .
The KRT shall ensure (i) liaison between Kebeles and community rangelands of smallest planning unit or
sites for those activities that need to be prioritized and reach coverage through joint effort; and (ii)
coordination between all the community rangelands sites belonging to kebele or beyond for specific
activities of common interest and benefit.  The composition of the KWT will include: the (1) Kebele
Chairman; (2) Kebele manager; (3) three DAs and the head of the Kebele office of agriculture including the
animal health extension worker; (4) one male and one female representative of the kebele; (5) one clan
leader of the kebele ; (6) a youth representative; (7) a Kebele range land administrator (local representative);
(8) a health extension worker; (9) the school head;  and (10) a private sector representatives (if any).
The role of KRT will include the following
i. Ensuring that rangeland planning is organized in each community rangelands;
ii. Setting priorities based on needs, degradation level and watershed logic;

[46]

iii. Coordinating interventions that concern more than one community or within the brooder rangeland
management;
iv. Assisting in targeting and quality control;
v. Settling disputes and provision of support on specific issues such as access and use of rangelands;
vi. Providing overall guidance on community rangeland management;
vii. Assisting communities in monitoring and evaluating and compiling reports;
viii. Holding progress review meetings once every two weeks;
ix. Resolving conflicts between adjacent community rangelands or Kebeles.

5.4.4 Woreda level preparatory activities
The WRT should engage in a Woreda level preliminary activities involving the collection of Woreda basic
data, setting goals, identification and mapping of kebeles and rangelands, coordination between Kebeles
and communities, and preliminary visits to communities.
1) Basic woreda data collection : the WRT should be capable of leading the overall rangeland
development in the woreda. Hence, the team before starting the planning work, they should be
equipped with the relevant data of the woreda that will help or facilitate the planning process. Some
of the relevant data to be collected includes, metrological data (rainfall, temperature, windspeed,
sunshine hours), water resource data, woreda land use land cover data, Woreda soil type data,
woreda CSA data, major crops growing in the woreda and their coverage, climatic hazards, woreda
disaster risk profile, shape files of administrative boundary of the woreda and kebeles etc.

2)  Set preliminary goals: This will be a fundamental step for visualizing changes anticipated within
the Woreda, in which five to ten -year development goal is set on how to improve the overall
Woreda development. The goal/s will be refined throughout the planning process to represent
shared goals among stakeholders. Concrete objectives with measurable targets  and indicators to
measure progress will then be developed through consecutive discussions with communities and
other stakeholders.

3) Identification and mapping of Kebeles, community rangelands and important features in the
woreda by using 1: 50,000 topo maps, GIS tools and the collective knowledge of woreda experts
and other key informants. The WRT should prepare woreda level map consisting important
features, e.g. identify interesting features and characteristics that influence mapping and
management, such as seasonal grazing areas, drought reserves, corridors, water points, patterns of
mobility (livestock and people) both within the Kebele and the broader rangeland area, etc. The
woreda level mapping will be further verified by proceeding to the field and delineate the location
of these features and locations of gendas/ villages/ communities within the Kebele.  Besides, the
WRT should support the DAs in preparing base and development maps of community rangeland
during the preparation of community rangeland development plans. Community rangeland
development maps may contain land use, location and size of rangelands, water points, settlements,
hot spot areas for climatic hazards and may also be possible to mark major drainage courses
(consisting of rivers/streams, other drainage lines) as well as features of land degradation, location
and area coverage of invasive species, and recommended technologies as required.

[47]

4)  Identification and organization of DAs’ tasks
• Undertake DAs training on participatory rangeland development principles and technological
options: DAs may have broad concept of participatory rangeland management (PRM) planning
but may not possess sufficient mapping skills, socio-economic planning, participatory methods
and technical skills on specifi c measures. Woreda training should be organized and training
materials provided. A specific rangeland area and community could be selected for the exercise
and serve both purposes of planning and training.
• Organize materials and equipment: for both training and surveying/planning work. Such items
include:
- Teaching aids: 1:50,000 scale topo maps, stationery, planning module, and others
- Copy of the info-tech document
- Measuring tape and/or string for distance measurement
- Line levels and range poles
- Other items of relevance
• Meet DAs to discuss pre -selection of community rangelands : The Woreda Rangeland Team
should make advantage of regular monthly or quarterly meetings with DAs to explain pastoral
rangeland planning and management principles and request DA’s assistance to discuss the
position of Kebele and communities within the respective pastoral Kebeles
5) First visit at Kebele level
▪ First discussion with Kebele /community /clan leaders and DAs. The WRT and the DAs introduce
and explain participatory rangeland management issues and principles to the Kebele leaders and
representatives. The Team explains the intervention logic and provides some concrete examples of
typical rangeland ecosystem interactions, for example flood control, water table/ water well
recharge, overgrazing and land degradation, rangeland encroachments, enclosures /rotation grazing
and regeneration of rangeland vegetation, etc. Besides, the WRT will discuss with KRT on how the
kebele is divided in to suitable community rangeland planning units.  Let the community
representatives reach some of these conclusions b ased on their own experience in the locality.
Using topo maps 1:50,000 scale, discuss with DAs and Kebele leaders/ and clan leaders/
community leaders the following points:
▪ The broader rangeland boundaries within which the Kebele is located. Draw/verify boundaries of
the Kebele and see how much they overlap with the broader rangeland territorial units, and the
major interactions within and between Kebele communities within the broader rangeland unit. This
exercise helps in validating the selection and reac hing agreement over boundaries and
resources to be included . In communal rangelands, this is an important step for ensuring that a
suitably large-scale approach is used, breaking out of highly localized and village -level planning.
Engage knowledgeable elders/ clan leaders to explain the trends and changes in recen t years, as
well as brief on the historical context and any relevant details prior to beginning the mapping
exercise e.g. identify interesting features and characteristics that influence mapping and
management, such as seasonal grazing areas, drought reserves, corridors, water points, patterns of
mobility (livestock and people) both within the Kebele and the broader rangeland area, etc. Proceed
to the field and delineate the location of these features and locations of gendas/ villages/
communities within the Kebele and divide the kebele in to mangable planning unit of community
rangelands.

[48]

▪ For each community discuss and mark key rangeland resource related issues and main interactions
within and between Kebeles. This is very important as the Woreda Rangeland Team together with
the Kebele leaders and the DA(s) will identify preliminary key treatment requirements and solutions
that may involve one or more pastoral communities or even more Kebeles nested in a broader
rangeland unit. The team will also visualize the various potentials and logical sequence of activities
needed to rehabilitate the whole area.
▪ With consensus reached so far, hold a final meeting with the Kebele leaders and the DA(s) to
discuss the next step(s) for planning, and for establishing and organizing Kebele Rangeland Team
(KRT) and Kebele/Sub-kebele/Village CR teams
▪ Discuss and prepare a supervision plan to assist DAs during planning work.
Prepare enlarged maps with the targeted pastoral community boundaries and of the Kebele and the wider
rangeland boundary in which the targeted Kebele (s) are nested in and benefiting from. Leave one copy of
the map with the DA and Kebele leaders.
At this stage, the target Kebele boundaries, important land units within the boundaries are identified and
delineated, major features and resources located, and preliminary information on inter community and inter
Kebele linkages and interactions within the broader rangeland unit/ boundary identified and documented.
The minimum acceptable planning units for the pu re pastoral areas (community rangeland) will be
identified.

6 Determine Minimum Unit of Planning
In the guideline updating process the planning unit for pastoral area as kebele was tested for its practicality
and simplicity and it was found that the total area coverage of most of the test kebeles were found from
16,000ha to more than 30,000ha which revealed that bringing together planning members of rangeland
teams together with scattered settlement pattern and application of tools to conduct the socio -economic
survey, biophysical survey, especially carrying out transect walk surveys, for understanding the problem of
the kebele was found really difficult and unpractical. Hence, manageable size of planning unit by dividing
the kebele in to community rangeland s is recommended. Community Rangeland, with manageable size
suitable for participating communities and plan development interventions, represents the smallest possible
planning unit for interventions in pastoral livelihood systems.
The planning process sh ould be initiated with the participation of the community, identify development
interventions and to be endorsed by themselves who regularly access and utilize the rangeland resources
residing for most of the seasons within the Kebele. The planning and imp lementation of activities should
still consider watershed (ridge to valley) logic as much as possible since watersheds and flow of water exists
in every landscape including those in the pure pastoral areas, called rangeland watersheds. However, it
should also be noted that pastoral communities almost always have seasonal/ reciprocal rights to rangeland
resources over a wide geographical area and usually these resources fall outside the designated planning
unit and administrative boundaries even at kebele and woreda level. And management of those rangelands
at different levels by pastoralist communities can intersect, overlap, and sometimes conflict with
administrative boundaries in complex ways.

[49]

In principle planning should, therefore, cover the full scope of resources that the communities regularly
access and use.  A possible approach to addressing these challenges is working on the broader rangeland
boundaries within which the Kebeles are located, analyze major connections and interactions between the
communities of the different Kebeles within the broader rangeland unit, and devise mechanism for
coordinating efforts. The geographic extent of the rangeland unit can be defined on the basis of exis ting
customary territories (e.g Arda or Madda in Borana) that have established geographical extent and
approximate borders. With multi-level planning approach, the main planning can take place at community
level, with planning and discussions to be held at the lower levels (e.g. single or groups of close settlements/
villages/ communities) as appropriate.
A ‘community rangeland’ as defined here, is a single or group of close settlements or villages around a
rangeland area that the communities regularly access and use within a kebele. The rangeland management
plans of the targeted community nested within the broader rangeland boundary are then linked and
coordinated through the Kebele Rangeland Teams working together with appropriate traditional rangeland
governance structure/ institutions and overseen and supported by the Woreda Rangeland Teams.

FIGURE 4: THE BORANA RANGELAND UNITS

7 Identify and involve relevant  traditional institutions, governance structure and functions in
pastoral communities
Rangeland resource management is based on a complex set of temporary or semi -permanent claims on
pasture, water and other resources, as well as on the underlying principles of flexibility and reciprocity. The
resource bases of pastoralists-land-is therefore largely not a fixed individually owned capital, but rather a
flexible asset with specific uses and access mechanisms. Livestock, rangeland and water resources use and
management are core components of the customary institutional system. Management of these resources
are closely bound to the pastoral livelihood and strictly observed by the local traditional leaders (elders,
clan and sub clan heads, Abba-Gadaa, sultan, Ugaz). Every member of the community is required to respect
the customary laws, enforced by the pastoral indigenous institutions run by elders with accumulated
knowledge of the ecology and experiences. These customary institutions are still important although there
has been gradual erosion of cultural norms, and of the role and influence of these traditional institutions.

[50]


Some donor funded projects (e.g. PRIME in Oromiya and Afar) engagements with local governments
helped revitalization and potential sustainability of upgraded traditional pastoralist rangeland management
systems and customary institutions. Building on traditional structures, rangeland management units/
councils were developed and/or strengthened at different levels (see Figure 9 and 10). The system is based
on the customary territorial system (e.g. the dheeda, arda and reera territories in Borana), and the multi -
level organizational structure mirrors the traditional system, but with government representation at reera
and arda level management councils. The elders selected to sit on councils typically include customary
leaders in the traditional governance structure, and this establishes a key linkage to that system.
Traditionally, the rangelands of Borana have been managed by the Borana traditional grazing systems, with
ownership of the land vested in the community and supervised by an intricate governance mechanism with
a hierarchy of organization at the “Olla” (several households), “Arda” (a cluster of Ollas), “reera”
(collection of close Ardas) and “Dheeda” (a larger grazing area) levels. Madda: Lit. ‘Aquifer’ or ‘permanent
water source’ also refers to a territory organized according to water sources. It is the second largest
leadership unit after dheeda.These associated community institutions  were used to manage the diverse
ecological zones effectively with clear delineation of key resources and drought reserves.

FIGURE 5: MANAGEMENT STRUCTURES STRENGTHENED IN PRIME INTERVENTION AREAS AS PART OF PRM IN BORANA
Note on figure 9: Arda management units, organized into 10 reera management units, and the 10 reeras in
to one dheeeda management unit. Arda is more or less commensurate with kebele therefore taken as PA.
The rangeland councils at arda level include 8 memb ers (five members from the local officials and three
elders) therefore a total of 232 people for the 29 ardas. The five members from local officials include the
peasant association (PA) -level Security Council representative, officers of Women and Children Affairs
and of Youth Affairs, the development agent (DA), and the PA chairman. All the arda committee members
from all the ardas of a particular reera meet together and assign three people to serve as abba reera (30
people in total). The three -abba reeras from each reera come together at dheeda level and select the abba
dheedas (10 people). The community representation is based on community members who are elected by
the people and included into the arda -level grazing committees. Members of arda -level committees are
classified as permanent and non -permanent. The permanent members are the three elders. The other five
members—the government representatives—may change their position or move to other PAs or be replaced

[51]

by other newcomers. In this kind of situati on, the person who will take the position of that particular
individual will take over the responsibilities and roles of the former person. There are no reserved spots for
women or minorities. Women typically are represented in the arda committees by virtu e of the fact the
government officer for Women’s and Children’s Affairs is usually a woman

In Somali region, traditional leadership is based on clan ties where the clan chief, called Ugaas, plays the
ultimate role in resource management, conflict resoluti on or prevention, and political and administrative
matters affecting the community. Every clan has its own Ugaas responsible for its affairs. Different clans
give different names to the Ugaas, such as Sultan, Gareda, Waber, Malaq, etc., but all have functions and
authorities similar to those of an Ugaas. Below the Ugaas in the hierarchy of leadership is a council of
elders, representing the different sub-clans or houses of the clan.  The council meets only if there are critical
issues concerning the clan to discuss. The sub-clan representatives are responsible for issues related to the
daily lives of the community at village level, or Reeri. Most issues are handled by elders at grassroots level,
including the socialization of young people, land allocation for cultivation, and deciding the directions and
times for mobility. At both clan and sub -clan levels, leaders and elders play an important role in conflict
resolution, ruling on the use of natural resources, and the implementation and enforcement of customa ry
laws.
The Afar sustain their production system through the indigenous institutions Medaa and Adaa. The Medaa
is the customary legal system that makes decisions and governs the management and use of the rangeland,
dealing with issues such as conflict re solution, natural resource management (including livestock and
rangelands), mutual assistance, external relationships, and emergency situations (such as drought). Adaa is
the set of rules (customary laws) set by the Medaa. Authority is based on clan ties, with a structure of clan
leader (Kedo Aba), vice clan leaders (Dala Aba), youth leaders (Fei’ma Aba), and council of elders (locally
called Edola). The Kedo Aba, Dala Aba, and Edola have decisive roles in resolving disputes between clans,
individuals, and other ethnic groups, strengthening the clan, segregating members of their own clan from
other clans, and advising clan and sub -clan members regarding their safety and w ell-being, as well as in
managing access to land.
Most decisions pertinent to the arbitration and settlement of disputes over social and economic issues and
the management of rangeland and natural resources are taken by these leaders, who also manage and protect
the Adaa (customary laws), Islamic religious practices, and the Afar pastoral way of life. Land in Afar is
divided into sultanates, which are further divided into tribe and clan territories. Each clan usually presides
over a number of strategic resources, such as wet and dry season grazing areas and water points. The Kedo
Aba is the primary decision -maker related to land use and rights, including about land allocation to
‘outsiders.’ The Du’abe (“rangeland managers”) are the ones who facilitate and mobilise the movement of
livestock and the rotation of grazing land, under the authority of the clan leaders.

They decide when and where new grazing sites are required and will mobilize representatives from the sub-
clans (through the Dala Aba) to go out and assess the quantity and quality of rangeland resources. Decisions
made by the clan leaders and elders are passed on to Fei’ma’Aba youth leaders for implementation. The
Fei’ma’Aba are the enforcers of the elders’ decisions and are also responsible for gathering information on
key resources, condition of herds in grazing areas, status of pasture, security and hazards, which they give
to the clan leaders and Du’abe.

[52]

The different pastoral community groups in SNNPR and Gambella have important traditional systems and
institutions, which need to be considered.  Some of the pastoral communities in SNNPR are territory-based,
non-political ‘sections’ (e.g. Nyangatom in South Omo). Traditionally these sections had no fixed
boundaries but rather they reflect the relative positions of the settlements and the nomadic routines of their
members.
The top leadership in the hierarchy, of the traditional governance structure, has key roles on making
decisions on matters of rangeland use and management, and has absolute power on how, where, and when
livestock is grazed or browsed and how the land is used.
   FIGURE 6: MANAGEMENT STRUCTURES STRENGTHENED IN PRIME INTERVENTION AREAS AS PART OF PRM IN AFAR
The Mursi are patriarchal in nature and have a socio-political structure in which kin, clans, and local groups
called bhuranyoga (singular bhuran) are the most salient modes of organization. While there is freedom to
move within and across local districts, control over local resources, such as land and watering holes, is
generally managed by individuals and their respective clans. While grazing lands are an open access
resource, people tend to remain within their own local groupings (bhuranyoga). The Hamer (the other main
pastoral group in SNNPR) have traditional offices held either hereditarily or through public election,
following nominations by elders. The leaders holding these offices are involved in the day - to-day socio-
ecological, economic, ritual, and cultural affairs of the people (zersi) and the governance as well as use of
resources on the land. Decisions emerge in a roundabout way through informal and formal debates amongst
the elders (Donza). Depending on the situation, these debates may concern villages (gurda), larger territorial
units (tsinti, nowadays considered as kebele), or the whole of Hamer territory (Hamer pe).
In common with most pastoral groups, the Nuer in Gambella also have their own customary system and
governance structure. There is no h ereditary leadership in Nuer traditional governance structure – rather,
leaders are elected on the basis of personal qualities. These include lineage, age, seniority in the family,
large number of wives and children, marriage alliances, wealth in cattle, prowess as a warrior in youth, skill
in debate, and some ritual powers, which combined produce a suitable personality for a leader. The Nuer
also have a Kuaar Twac, who is the ritual leader, and the Kuaar Muon, the custodian of the land. A Guock
is a religious leader who performs different types of religious ceremonies and rituals. All these groups of
people play a central role in the decision -making processes of the community, including those related to
land use planning and rangeland resource management. T hey also settle disputes in the community and

[53]

manage mobility and decide when and where the community should move to grazing sites. Information on
the status of pasture, security, and anything that could help the well -being of the community and their
property is collected by youth acting as cattle herders and scouts, who also carry out patrols to protect the
livestock from robbers.

5.5 STEP 2: GETTING STARTED AT COMMUNITY LEVEL
The DA together with Kebele leaders will call members of the
community rangeland communities for general assembly, care
should be taken in selecting the meeting date to ensure  majority
of the members of the communities participate. During the
general assembly, the DAs and kebele leaders provide an
introduction of the relevance of rangeland resource management
issues to the community, discuss the present situation with the
rangeland resources, the need for changes/ improvements in
resource use and management. Let the community members
reflect on the issues based on their own experiences. Encourage
the involvement of as many community members as possible and
ensure the views of women heard in the discussion. Do not raise
expectations and remain within the range of activities and problems within your mandate and capacity.
This discussion must lead to consensus on the next steps on planning including the formation of Community
Rangeland Team. But if the community members are not convinced, do not push them. Just try again. It is
crucial that technical staff shows good manner, respectful and friendly behavior, avoiding any type of
coercive and superior attitudes. The community should be made aware of the participatory nature of the
methodology. It is important to clarify that they will be the final decision -makers and that selection of
measures will take place together with them based on feasible solutions and local constraints.
Before ending the general meeting, the community should be informed that all members are welcome to
participate in the planning process. However, because it is practically difficult to deal with each and every
member of the community, and that the community needs to elect a dedicated and representative planning
team. In all circumstances, during field surveys the team will always meet community members, either as
individuals of groups (based on specific interests). Emphasize also the fact that the team will be c losely
working with the exiting traditional rangeland systems and institutions, as appropriate, and that their roles
will be defined and agreed in the planning process.
Composition of the Community Rangeland Team considers key issues such as gender, soci al and wealth
status, and geographical representation (members representing different corners of the communities in a
rangeland unit). In pastoral areas where women are engaged in pastoral livelihood, their presence in the
community team should get due con cern and enhancement. After the wealth ranking exercise has been
performed with the community and a realistic profile obtained of the social status and assets of the
community members, they should be asked to elect 12 people's representatives, drawn from among each of
the main social groups, to form the “Community Rangeland Team (CRT)”. Of the 12, half should be
women who not only represent different social groups but are also influential and outspoken.
Step 2: Getting started at community
level
• Call for general assembly
• Establish KRT
• Establish community rangeland
team
• Agree on timing for planning

[54]

IMPORTANT NOTE: The role of the DA is crucial where cultural barriers inhib it the participation of
women. In case of a joint rangeland planning exercise involving both men and women, the DA should
intervene on a regular basis to ensure that the women participate and express their views. It may be useful
in some instances to have a subsequent and separate meeting with the female members to confirm and refine
the wealth ranking findings.

Composition of the CRT team will include the following: -
• Four male heads of household representing different social groups (including vulnerable
households) living in different parts of the community/village;
• Four female members representing different social groups (including vulnerable and female -
headed) and living in different strata of the community;
• Two youth representatives, one male and one female;
• Two more as required by the community (representative of local governance members/ respected/
influential people, women's group, or other representative groups).

The CRT will elect one Team Leader and one Secretary. The roles of CRT will include the following
▪ Ensure community-based planning is organized in each rangeland community
▪ Coordinate interventions that concern more than one community
▪ Assist in targeting and quality control
▪ Settle disputes and provide support on specific issues as they arise
▪ Provide overall guidance on rangeland management requirements
▪ Hold a regular meeting once in two weeks to review progress made
▪ Participate in conflict resolution in adjacent communities within and between Kebeles
▪ Serve as a permanent contact with the development agent, the rest of the community/ target group
and local leaders during planning, implementation and monitoring and evaluation
▪ Actively participate and cooperate with the woreda experts, and DAs during identification of
problems, opport unities, priority setting, overall plan preparation processes as well as during
implementation
▪ Initiate and seek administrative and technical support from responsible organizations for the legal
establishment of Community /Kebele Rangeland Users Association
▪ Coach and aware pastoral HHs in all steps of planning and implementation
▪ Facilitate labor and material contributions agreed with the community and make available
according to the planned time and place
▪ Consult and get consensus from the community for hav ing a community wide rangeland
management by-law
▪ Identify and facilitate formation of various economic user groups to sustainably manage and use
resources of the rangeland watershed.

At the end of the meeting achieve agreement on a date for carrying out the planning exercise. At this stage
key resource persons may already have been tentatively identified who will coordinate community members
or groups during the problem identification, socio-economic and field surveys exercises.

[55]

5.6 STEP 3: SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND BIOPHYSICAL SURVEY IN PURE PASTORAL AREAS
Most of the socio-economic and biophysical survey tools described
in the mixed farming areas  are applicable to pastoral areas as well.
It is mainly an information-gathering step, designed to characterize
the community rangelands, community rangeland resources, and the
people living within its boundaries. It involves resource inventory
and assessment, including current rangeland resource use and
problems associated with it, socioeconomic situation of the pastoral
community, potentials, opportunities and limitations, and
prioritization of core problems and solutions. Th e information
gathered in this step provides the basis for identifying and prioritizing interventions to be implemented in
the pastoral community grazing land under consideration.

The approaches used for socio-economic and biophysical survey/analysis include Participatory description of
the pastoral community grazing lands : This involves participatory mapping and transects. Using these
methods, the main biophysical conditions and interactions of the people and resources within the
community grazing land boundary and linkage and integration at the broader rangeland boundary, nesting
the Kebele(s), will be assessed and analyzed. These two exercises provide useful information about
rangeland resources and assess the opportunities and the major issues and limitations that are important for
the development of the area.

i. Participatory resource mapping:
Pastoral communities retain a wealth of knowledge about
their environment and resources, their use and management,
and historical trends. With this knowledge participatory
resource mapping enables communities (i) to collectively
develop visual picture of their landscape, natural resources,
land use systems, settlements, seasonal grazing movements,
etc and (ii) to reveal and analyze issues, challe nges and
opportunities for addressing them. Resource maps can be
combined with climate vulnerability analysis to assess
climate change trends and impacts on vegetation growth
patterns, livestock feed access, and pastoral livelihood in
general.
                                                                                                                        Source: CARE Ethiopia, 2015

The overall objective of Participatory Community Rangeland Planning is to improve the livelihood of
pastoral communities through comprehensive and integrated rangeland resource management and
development planning. Therefore, participatory resource maps are prepared in an integrated development-
planning framework. Depending on the objectives of the mapping exercise, resource maps may include the
following details:
▪ Wet and dry season grazing areas,
▪ Drought grazing areas/reserves
▪ Communal and/or private enclosures
▪ Riverine areas/ belts
▪ Hazard and exposure areas (flood plains, malaria prone areas etc)

▪ Water points/ water sources for human and livestock consumption
▪ Areas of conflict (over water and pasture, etc)
▪ Areas of tick or other insect infestations
▪ Areas of Invasive alien species
▪ Rangeland productivity ‘hot spots’
▪ Biodiversity ‘hotspots’
▪ Veterinary and health posts
▪ Markets, Schools and etc…
ii. Mapping mobility: Another key feature of a pastoralist community’s resource map is mobility routes:
showing where people and livestock travel. Mobility routes and destinations can be drawn for single or
multiple ethnic groups, for certain groups of households, or at a singl e household level, or for different
family members within a household and for different livestock types. After completing the basic resource
map participants can use ash, different colored soil, stick-drawn lines or rope to show the desired mobility
features, including:
▪ Seasonal livestock movements
▪ Seasonal use of rangeland resources
▪ Seasonal food availability and access
▪ Seasonal risks (malaria, waterborne diseases, flooding, heat wave etc.)
▪ Preferred trekking routes
▪ Dates, seasons and frequency of travel
▪ Route, distance and destinations
▪ Primary and secondary purposes
▪ Gender disaggregated movements and etc…
iii. Interpretation of the resource map/ present situation maps : Based on the resource map/ present
situation map community members will then identify problems associated with each resource in the
rangelands and the opportunities that exist. At this stage community members may focus on significant
problems that affect t heir livelihoods and unpack the root cause or factors that contribute to those
problems. A resource matrix (Table 8 below) can be used to list key resources, in their order of importance
to the community, and ranked list of threats to these resources and opportunities.

The map shows the current status of resources within the Waso rangelands, as identified by the local
community. It clearly shows the locations of important resources, mobility patterns and route s during dry
and wet seasons, drought reserve areas, settlement patterns, degraded areas, and bush encroachment. The
map also indicates the routes used by neighboring communities who depend on the Waso rangelands mainly
during drought periods.

iv. Vision mapping: The vision map is produced based on information in the resource present situation map.
Vision maps show the aspirations of the community in relation to their rangeland landscape and resources
over the next 5 -10 years period. On vision map, communit ies indicate how they would like use and
manage their resources in the future. The content of the vision map feeds into the discussions in the
planning stage, during which communities identify solutions to current problems, and opportunities to
enhance their livelihoods.

[58]

v. Taking care with boundaries : While the minimum of unit planning is still the community
rangeland, it is advisable not to start mapping with an administrative boundary, such as that of a woreda
or kebele, as the pastoral communities almost always have seasonal/ reciprocal rights to r angeland
resources over a wide area and usually these resources fall outside the administrative boundary. The initial
mapping exercise should, therefore, cover the full scope of resources that the communities regularly
access and use. Questions on various boundaries including that of kebele may be raised and discussed at
the final stage of the mapping process. And the boundaries delineated should be verified at a later date
with neighboring communities.
vi. Standardizing symbols : It is important to standardi ze use of materials as symbols in the mapping
exercise. These should be locally available materials, and include ash, leaves, sticks, twigs, animal dung,
stones, pebbles, wet and dry grass, charcoal, etc.  During the mapping exercise, ash can be used to indicate
grazing routes/ seasonal movements, stones for water points, grasses for wet and dry season grazing areas,
etc. Participants may use sticks or twigs to represent woodlands/ bushlands, and if possible, sticks or
twigs of different trees used to represent different types of trees and woodland/ bushland resources.
vii. Paper maps and digitization: Participatory resource maps facilitate community -led mapping process,
help in identification of key features, and reveal a lot of relevant information on important resources, but
they are not accurate for their use in planning and management over extensive area. Important information
on these maps can be retained in the form of photographs, taken immediately after the participatory
mapping exercise is completed, and used in the preparation of a more advanced GIS supported resource
maps.

PART 1: SECTION A (2) - 3 COMMON PLANNING STEPS FOR
MIXED FARMING AND PURE PASTORAL AREAS

5.7 STEP 4: GENDER & SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT (GSD), NUTRITION, AND
INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT
5.7.1 GSD and Nutrition

GSD focuses on the promotion of gender equality and on the
inclusion of the poor and vulnerable by empowering them to
undertake their own development, to improve their social and
economic position, to acquire their rightful place in a cohesive
and resilien t society. The focus of GSD in the watershed
planning and implementation is to ensure appropriate and
adequate consideration of the needs and opportunities for
women, and other vulnerable social groups such as people with
health, physical, and mental issues, or people facing stigma due
to their social or ethnic minority status, or people living with
HIV/AIDS, etc. By the same token, interventions within the
watersheds should address the nutritional status of women, children and other segments of the community.

In so doing, all the watershed development initiatives should start with contextual GSD analysis Annexes
Part III, annex 2 covering all the groups mentioned above. It is a tool that examines the differences in the
lives of women and men in a given context, and it systematically looks at different impacts of potential and
current development programs and interventions on women and men, and on boys and girls. It is intended
to identify and analyze the underlying causes of these inequities and to propose strategies for bridging the
gender gap. Contextual gender analysis in a watershed development planning helps:
▪ to identify that women's and men's lives, experiences, needs, issues and priorities are different in a
given community and watershed;
▪ in the recognition that the needs and priorities of women are not the same as those of men, nor are
they homogenous (i.e. they depend on lifestyle needs and priorities which may vary from one group
of women to another depending on age, ethnicity, religion,  health and disability status, social
position, education and income levels, employment status, marital status, sexual orientation and
whether they have dependents) and
▪ Findings from the gender analysis of a community in a given watershed are highly critic al in
ensuring that the gender issues are mainstreamed through the planning and other stages of
interventions and that the design of the proposed watershed development projects is appropriate
and sustainable. It also indicates the strategies that should be adopted in order to achieve equitable
outcomes for women and men; and different groups of women in a given watershed.
Thus, mainstreaming of the GSD and nutrition are part of a key strategy ensuring that gender, social
development and nutrition issues form an integral dimension in the design, planning, implementation, and
M&E of watershed developments. Particularly, the following key issues should be considered: -
Step 4: GSD, Nutrition and
Integrated Risk Management
• GSD and Nutrition Mainstreaming
• Contextual Gender Analysis Tool
• Integrated Risk Management
• Climate Smart Mainstreaming
• Climate Smart Planning

[60]

• Ensure equal representation of men and women in decision making (planning, monitoring and
evaluation)
• Genuine participation of men and women in planning team and general assembly.
• Participation in the implementation of watershed management should consider women workload
and their triple roles in the community (Reproductive, Productive and Social roles)
• Technology selection should consider gender disaggregated problems and nutrition requirements
of the vulnerable groups (children, women, people with disabilities and HIV Affected) in the
community
• Capacity development interventions should consider the knowledge and skill needs of women and
vulnerable groups
• There should be fair women representation in watershed users’ association
• Women and other vulnerable groups (the poor and youths) should be given livelihoods
opportunities following the creation of assets within the rehabilitated watersheds
The findings of these and gender and social analyses should be used to ensure elements are appropriately
included in the responsive planning, budgeting, recruitment of technical expertise, an d in the subsequent
M&E.
5.7.2 Mainstreaming of Integrated Risk Management (Climate change, disaster
risk reduction, ecosystem management and restoration)

For this guideline, mainstreaming integrated risk management into the watershed management practices
means considering and addressing risks associated with disasters and climate change in assessment,
planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of watershed management measures. This
significantly contributes to the sustainability, effectiveness and efficiency of the soil and water conservation
measures which are put in place. For instance, the size and quality of the check-dams, soil and stone bunds
have better chance of sustainability if they consider potential extreme weather events (climate predictions)
in their design. Disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation measures that are not based and
consider the proper management of the watershed tend to fail. The practical approach on how to do it are
presented below.
Disaster risk reduction (DR R) is the concept and practice of reducing disaster risks through systematic
efforts to analyze and manage the causal factors of disasters, including through reduced exposure to hazards,
lessened vulnerability of people and property, wise management of land and the environment, and improved
preparedness for adverse events. Climate change adaptation (CCA) is the adjustment in natural or human
systems in response to actual or expected climate stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits
beneficial opportunities.  The term ‘climate-smart’ is widely used to describe an approach to agriculture
that has three pillars:  sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes; adapting and building
resilience to climate change; and reducing and/or removing greenhouse gases emissions, where possible.6
Ecosystem Management and Restoration (EMR): Ecosystem management – is the degree to which an
ecosystem‘s functions require human intervention in order to maintain ecosystem health (i.e., stakeholder
agreed methods to ensure multiple objectives can be met). Is an integrated process to conserve and improve
ecosystem health that sustains ec osystem services for human wel lbeing, a lso planned administrative

[61]

functions that develop, implem ent, and monitor the ecosystems health. Ecosystem restoration – is an
intentional activity that initiates or accelerates the recovery of a degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystem
with respect to its health, integrity, services, and sustainability.
In applying this concept to CBPWD, a set of approaches has emerged that are intended to achieve three key
objectives:
(i) Maximizing the contribution in terms of reducing people’s vulnerability to climate change
Climate change is more and more characterized by extreme weather events that include: increasingly high
temperatures; very intense rainfall and flooding; and more frequent and intense drought conditions (see
https://ccafs.cgiar.org/publications/climate-smart-agriculture-ethiopia#.XObd-ohKiUk).  As stated in that
document “Climate risk management interventions and long -term adaptation actions need to match
localized vulnerabilities and impacts”.  In very general terms there are three in ter-related approaches that
can be adopted to reduce people’s vulnerability to these events: reducing their exposure; reducing their
sensitivity to them; and increasing their adaptive capacity.  All of these falls within the label of climate
smart agriculture.  The reduction of exposure to extreme rainfall events includes the design and installation
of measures, including structures that protect infrastructure and livelihood activities from flooding.

The reduction of sensitivity, particularly to drought, generally involves making changes or adjustments to
livelihood activities that lessen the impact of these events.  This might for example include the installation
of efficient small-scale irrigation systems or improved fodder production and storage for livestock.  These
two foregoing examples represent the concept of co -benefits which will be discussed further below.
Increasing adaptive capacity depends on a variety of inter -related factors including knowledge, skills and
access to information, services and resources.  As such these factors are strongly influenced by social status
and educational levels in which gender is a significant factor.  Building awareness and responsive capacity
is therefore a k ey consideration in building adaptive capacity and requires a strong and gender equity
component to ensure it is well disseminated through the community. For CBPWD interventions to
contribute to reducing vulnerability to climate change, a combination of these three pathways is necessary
and there should be a linking of these to public works activities that decrease exposure with livelihood
interventions that reduce sensitivity.  At the same time measures should also be taken to increase access to
the knowledge, information and resources that enable adaptive management of livelihoods.
(ii) Increasing the resilience and sustainability of watershed development investments in relation to
climate change.
Integrated watershed development already involves investment  in both livestock and crop husbandry
practices that require engagement of the whole community in changing their existing approaches to natural
resource management (NRM).  A good example of this is the introduction of climate smart agricultural
husbandry practices such as; minimum tillage practices, with the crop residue retention and intercropping
(for instance with beans in maize production). The introduction of these changes may also influence the
entire management of the community lands and infrastructu re. In planning these interventions, therefore,
the manner in which they are likely to be affected by climate change events over time and the very
significant threat of these events to their effectiveness and sustainability should be kept in mind.  In this
context, integration of climate-smart thinking is critical to ensure that investments are resilient to weather
extremes and are sustainable over the longer term, taking climate change into account.

[62]

(iii) Supporting climate change mitigation (where possible and appropriate)
Wherever possible and appropriate, climate change mitigation co-benefits will be pursued. Mitigation co-
benefits include reduction in use of fuels such as diesel, petrol, wood and charcoal, through for example,
fuel-efficient technologies or development of alternative energy sources such as biogas and solar power.
They also include increased carbon sequestration through tree planting and protection of existing forests,
as well as agro -forestry and improved rangeland management practices.  Whe n these measures support
climate resilience, the mitigation co-benefits provide an additional motivation to implement them.
5.7.3 Climate Smart Planning

Climate-smart watershed development interventions are aimed at reducing the impact of weather-related
hazards on communities’ high value resources and/or increasing the quality or availability of resources to
render them less sensitive to climate impacts. Climate-smart livelihood interventions are intended to support
adjustments to existing livelihood activities so as to reduce their sensitivity to climate impacts by enabling
better risk management and climate change adaptation by women and men.  This usually involves natural
resources management interventions that protect or enable access t o resources that are needed for new or
adjusted livelihood activities, and complementary strategies that support diversification of income sources
(such as the climate smart husbandry practices mentioned in the preceding paragraph). Climate -smart
planning therefore requires the application of integrated approaches, bringing together watershed
management interventions with livelihoods options to maximize impacts. Given that Integrated Watershed
Development must address and analyze livelihoods issues, it is i mportant that consideration goes well
beyond the immediate NRM related issues, to explore how extreme weather hazards are already, and will
continue to impact the community. This provides a critical basis for identifying activities that will reduce
vulnerability to climate change. Guidance and tools are provided in ( Annexes Part III, annex  1) for
incorporating a watershed climate analysis to complement the other dimensions in this step of the CBPWD
planning process; as well as tools for including a matching intervention in the Watershed Climate Analysis,
the Climate -Smart Prioritization of Interventions and the Climate -Smart Screening of the Community
Watershed Plan.

For climate smart outcomes to be achieved, thus improved community resilience to climate induced shocks,
natural resource management activities should be integrated with livelihoods related income generating
activities for the community. The different IGAs should undergoes risk analysis that anticipates the
changing environment and the anticipated climate change induced hazards that might affect their business.
This require the communities to develop what we call business plan before they engage in any of the
livelihoods activities that follows series of steps provided in Annexes Part III, annex 5.
In order the business plan to be prepared in adequate manner, the community members and DAs/ or woreda
experts or any other facilitator should clearly understand the following information that come from various
sources including community consultation and client capacity assessments.

First, any community member who want to engage in business activities should be clear about the type of
IGA (s) he or she is willing and able to implement. This should come partly from the awareness created
during the community consultation and partly from technical training given by DAs to Community
members about livelihoods development . Ask key questions such as: d o community members have the
necessary skills/experiences and knowledge needed to operate this activi ty? Do they have time to operate

[63]

the activity and do they know the seasons/period of investment to be profitable?  What risks will business
face: how likely are to occur & what is planned to mitigate and adapt such risks?

Second, the communities need a cle ar information on financial services (savings and loans) available. If
loan provisions are one of the services, the technical advisors (DAs, woreda experts, financial institution
loan officers, RuSACCO staffs, etc.) must make sure that community members ar e clear about the size,
terms and conditions of the loan in relation to the identified IGAs and other working capital costs.

Third, Community members should also demonstrate readiness to commit part of their own resources to
the Business Plan (IGA investment) whenever applicable. However, contribution from own sources should
be voluntary because households have several other commitments for which own resources may have
already been committed. Therefore, facilitators should demonstrate with evidence the adv antages of
increasing the capital from own sources (e.g. higher returns from increased investments; diversified IGAs
to reduce risk).

Fourth, Community members also need information on input sources and market linkages.  Different IGAs
require different inputs and their market outlets also vary. Information regarding inputs should come from
the extension service, and information regarding product and labor markets should come from the market
value chain analysis and product and linkage study done for the kebeles and the woredas.

In addition, t he BP should consider important cross cutting issues such as (i)identification and access to
feasible income generation activities (IGAs) from gender perspective , (ii)  the need for stakeholders’
collaboration and coordination during preparation and implementation of interested community BPs,  (iii)
recommendations of IGAs specific to youth /groups and (iv) Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) compliance in accordance with section 5.8.5 of this guideline.

5.7.4 Disaster Risk Reduction

Disaster risk reduction provides short term to mid -term solutions based on the scale of the disaster
considering the past and present experiences. Promotion of drought tol erant seed varieties and animal
breeds, building of embankments, early warning systems, contingency plan, temporarily evacuating people
from flood plains, water harvesting, promotion of drought tolerant animal breeds, mangrove plantation
along costal lines , check dams, retention walls, saving and credit schemes, temporarily migration with
livestock to pastor and water areas, destocking and restocking, provision of food for work/cash for work
etc. All these are measures to address short term to mid -term needs of vulnerable communities. However,
these measures should be carefully selected and prioritized in their contribution for multiple positive
impacts specifically to the rehabilitation and management of degraded watersheds. Experience showed that
some disaster risk reduction measures in drought prone areas were done at the expense of the ecosystem.
In some places target communities were clearing indigenous trees at a bank of a river to get access to fertile
land and water in order to plant drought tolerant seeds.  On the other hand, engaging communities in DRR
activities (construction of check dams and retention walls through cash for work programs) have
significantly reduced tree cutting and charcoal burning to address short term cash needs. Village saving and
credit scheme (as part of DRR measures) has shown multiple positive impacts on vulnerable households.
Well-selected Climate Change Adaptation Measures could also help to protect and even ensure the lasting
benefits of DRR measures that have put in place. In order for DRR measures to serve as adaptation measures

[64]

too, they have to be futuristic-looking and consider not only the past and present hazard experience but also
its severity and magnitude in the future. For instance, a flood embankment construct ed to retain a flood
magnitude of 2 meters high, may not be good enough to block potential floods in the same location in the
next ten years. This magnitude of flood could even be better managed through a well-managed and properly
selected trees (natural wall) than a concrete wall.


5.8 STEP 5: IDENTIFICATION, PRIORITIZATION AND SAFEGUARDS OF
INTERVENTIONS THAT BRING CHANGE

After completion of Step 4, the DA and the CWT/CRT will have
gathered a considerable amount of information from the
community, key informants, focal groups, field surveys and
mapping work.  As a result, the DA and the CWT become much
more aware of the constraints faced by the community and the
potentials and oppor tunities for resolving them and for
development.  At this stage it is now necessary to relate the
various socio-economic issues to the biophysical measures that
might be taken both within and outside the community watershed
in order to select the interventions that will result in the desired
changes. Interventions should be technically feasible and
implemented in the correct sequence meeting appropriate quality
criteria. Poor quality work fail to generate sustainable change, may eventually worsen the situat ion and
generate mistrust:  it always represents a waste of resources.

5.8.1 Identification of interventions and prioritization elements

Pool of experience and options: in order to select the most appropriate measures, particularly those related
to natural resource development and productivity enhancement, the DA and the CWT should carefully
assess land use, soil, slope, vegetation features, the source and magnitude of th e risk they are facing and
resources they have to mitigate or prevent it. They should identify those measures that are most suitable
under the various agro-ecological conditions based on the problems identified, demands made, or priorities
identified by the community. The principal pool of activities is categorized and summarized in table 9 and
is intended to provide guidance in the selection of measures. More details and practical information on the
most relevant measures are provided in the Info-tech support Section (B) of this Guideline
i.  The role of traditional knowledge : Traditional Ethiopian conservation measures involving physical
and biological measures and water harvesting have in the past played an important role in land husbandry.
They still continue to contribute to controlling erosion that would otherwise be even worse than what can
now be observed. Nevertheless, in many areas, traditional methods cannot cope with current trends of
land degradation and affected lands are being progressively abando ned.  The situation has been
exacerbated by increased demands on the available land and water resources to feed a growing population.
This has contributed to the adoption of more exploitative farming practices that have tended to replace
the old ones. Regardless of their limitations, traditional experience and knowledge in SWC and farming

safeguards of interventions that bring
change

and prioritization elements

[65]

should be capitalized on by field technicians and used effectively to identify, select, design and implement
improved natural resources development and productivity inten sification measures.  If for no other
reason, that many farmers are familiar with them.  The farming practices are the product of local
circumstances and evolved based on farmers’ perception of what functions well and what does not under
the existing conditions.  There is thus likely to be a benefit from the adoption of many of these practices
on a wider scale and so it is important to have knowledge of them, as they may often be the key to success.
The limitations to expanding their use may be technical, f inancial or related to tenure. In many
circumstances, their more widespread adoption may be resolved through the process of awareness
building, training, and the involvement of government institutions.
ii. Measures and target groups: Some measures should be implemented with individuals, others at group,
community, and inter -community levels.  These groups are often interconnected and should have a
common understanding of which activity would be most logical and advantageous, which to start on first,
or which s hould be done simultaneously. For example, the joint treatment of the upper parts of the
community watershed with simultaneous treatment of contiguous areas in adjacent communities may
result in sufficient water-table recharge to allow hand dug wells to be  established for many households
(i.e. at the individual level). In this case the treatment of the upper watershed area with trenches or
eyebrows will precede the introduction of the hand dug well technology. The treatment of such mostly
communal areas, will require community commitment and the introduction of by-laws restricting use of
communal grazing land and agreements to share the future benefits (trees, fodder).  In such situations the
DA and the CWT must tentatively decide on the measures to be imple mented and submit the proposal
during the general assembly meeting of the whole community for their comments and approval.
iii. The Role of the Development Agent: The DA plays a facilitating and technical role, leaving the CWT
to own the planning process. This increases their sense of responsibility and confidence. In this respect,
DAs professional skills and experience must guide them towards activities that are sound and beneficial
to the community and the target group.
iv. Addressing women’s needs : The reduction of workloads and environmental hardships are key
elements of community watershed planning. The DA should therefore ensure that the CWT places equal
importance on activities that benefit women.  This might mean, for instance, the promotion of activities
that specifically benefit women or their inclusion, as appropriate, in activities that can be carried out
jointly by men and women. Women’s workloads are alread y high, particularly in women -headed
households.  It is still probable, however, that women would be very interested in the treatment of upper
watersheds mostly because of the impact on water -tables and thus on the recuperation of springs and
wells and the filling of ponds.  The establishment of mixed woodlots near or around residences is also an
activity they might appreciate and desire. Most importantly, however, they are likely to be interested in
measures improving the productivity of their homesteads, participating in income generation activities,
credit schemes and other skills improvement. The DA should also promote joint community or group
efforts to assist the most vulnerable women -headed households, particularly those affected by labor
shortages.
NOTE: It may also happen that solutions to some problems and risks are beyond the mandate of the SWC
and the DA. If there is an opportunity for cooperation and integration with other institutions at this stage,
so much the better. Problems and risks tackled by a multidisciplinary and coordinated team are likely to be
much better addressed and resolved.  Care and the use common sense are indispensable when the DA is
acting alone in selecting measures.  Decisions concerning issues that the DA or SWC are unlikely or unable
to resolve should be delayed until they can be made with more appropriate support. At times the DA is

[66]

likely to encounter activities that are within their mandate but should still not be selected because of a lack
of appropriate skills or because the necessary resources are unlikely to be made available.  In such instances
WWT should be consulted for assistance in resolving such problems and amending the plan.
v. Promote participatory technology development for new and untested measures. Farmers may well be
very doubtful about engaging in new activities that the DA might wish to introduce but with which they are
unfamiliar.  This might include initiatives such as the introduction of unfamiliar crops types or crop
varieties, or of new spatial arrangements of crops and other land management practices that are intended to
produce benefits.  For this reason, it is always advisable for the DA to initiate small -scale trials where the
farmers can assess the performance of the proposed measures. If result s are seen to be beneficial and
manageable, they are likely to be adopted and implemented on a wider scale so long as the necessary
resources are available.  Such on-farm trials or simple trials near homesteads or in accessible nursery spaces
should be carefully monitored and evaluated and if possible include the application of a simple cost-benefit
analysis.
5.8.2  General technical and social aspects related to watershed planning
In planning development activities, the DA will notice that where there are problems and risks of common
interest to households which make it easy to reach agreement on the measures that should be implemented
to address the problem and reduce or even prevent risks. For example, the problem of water shortage can
be solved by rehabi litating a spring and/or constructing a pond which will have an immediate positive
impact and be greatly appreciated by farmers.  Such spring development is only be possible, however, if
there is sufficient flow; thus, only if the water -table is being acti vely recharged. The same applies to
community ponds; they can be constructed only if sedimentation from gully or sheet erosion is controlled
through appropriate measures such as gully stabilization and closure of the upstream catchment area. In
both cases,  the successful implementation of these activities depends on effective management of the
upstream areas adjacent to, but not within, that in which the activity is to be implemented.  It is evident
from this that planning, and sequencing of the activities is crucial for any successful community -based
natural resource infrastructure development and sustainable risk reduction.

It is also necessary to take great care when planning activities that might require farmers to contribute or
sell land on which the y are to be implemented.  It is essential to keep in mind the individual farmers are
decision-makers concerning the land they own and cultivate and that they must be consulted in relation to
any proposed initiatives that may affect its use. Their involveme nt in identifying and approving solutions
is absolutely essential.  In such instances the DA must spend the time necessary to contact and fully discuss
the design and objectives of the various initiatives with farmers.  This should include the design, the pros
and cons, the possible adaptations and the sequencing of the works.

It may also happen that solutions to some problems and risks are beyond The DA’s mandate. If cooperation
and integration with other institutions is taking place at this stage, so much the better, as it is best to have
problems and risks addressed and resolved by a multidisciplinary and coordinated team.  If the DA is acting
alone, however, in the selection of measures it is advisable to apply a good measure of common sense and to
reject or postpone solutions to problems and risks that are difficult or impossible because of lack of skills or
the necessary resources.  In such situations the WWT should be requested to resolve the problems and risks,
and the plan should only be amended after this consultation and the receipt of feedback from them.

[67]

NOTE: Each land user is responsible to not damaging other people’s land and for conserving and managing
their own land.  Conservation works on cultivated land must therefore be planned together with all the land
users cultivating a given sub -watershed area and consensus achieved on the layout of the necessary
infrastructure.  Elements such as Irrigation and  drainage ditches are usually continuous, and these cannot
be disconnected between the land of one farmer and the next, to suit individual demands or preferences.
Since not all land users will experience the same degree of impact or benefit, consideration must be given
to those who will be negatively affected should be compensated.  For instance, in the case of a farmer who
cannot afford to treat its own affected plot of land, he/she should be supported by other community members
with sufficient work force to accomplish the work based on the work norm ( Annexes, Part I and II annex
2) required for the intended activities.
Many degraded watersheds contain extensive and severely eroded cultivated lands which need
simultaneous and systematic treatment. This can be achieved by combining self -help resources from land
users supplemented by various other forms of assistance (free labor support, tools and materials and capital
input) depending on the degree of vulnerability of the households.  Moreover, it should be kept in mind that
the treatment of these cultivated lands is directly linked successful treatments in upper watersheds  and
should occur only if these upslope areas have been treated first (or simultaneously if and when time and
resources allow). The comprehensive treatment of hillsides with moisture conservation measures (trenches,
eyebrows, etc): (1) controls runoff and diminishes the risk of flooding on the lower lying cultivated lands;
(2) encourages re-vegetation; (3) increases yields and decreases the risk of crop failure on the lower lying
cultivated fields in the event of drought; and (4) helps to recharge water-tables.
Agricultural lands that are already degraded or unproductive and affected by serious erosion problems are
usually considered to be communal or abandoned lands and are mostly used for rough grazing and/or for
the collection of woody materials for fuel. The improvement or reclamation of such lands is often beyond
the capability and interest of a single farmer or a group of farmers but may be essential for the protection
of downstream cultivated areas, for water harvesting and for biomass regeneration. The whole community
should be engaged in planning for the rehabilitation of such lands.  This is necessary because specific
agreements and by-laws must be agreed to by all members of the community in order to respect the rights
all affected farmers and to e nsure that all eventually receive benefits (e.g. from the increased availability
fodder and wood, as well as the opportunity to once again grow crops on the reclaimed land). In such
situations, the involvement of local administrators and other influential people is essential in meetings, in
field visits and during the allocation of land-use certificates in order to avoid conflict and encourage active
interest and engagement of farmers and land users.

5.8.3 Key elements for the Integration and Sequencing in the planning and
implementation of watershed management activities

Rationale: Each of the many technical approaches that may be adopted for watershed and land-use planning
has its specific design, layout, implementation and management criteria.  However, the se approaches are
never applied in isolation and must be integrated with other measures (such as risk reduction and climate
change adaptation) so as to strengthen and improve their effectiveness, ensure the future productivity of the
land, reduce maintenance costs, and generate multiple benefits, including enhanced resilience in the face of
climate change. Box 2 provides several examples of why and how these principles should be applied.

[68]

Box 2: The integration of related watershed management measures
(i) Soil or stone bunds on steep slopes : once bunds have been installed they benefit from vegetative
stabilization with grass and legumes and the application of compost, particularly close to the bund area
where the soil is deeper and the moisture higher.  The  husbandry practices above the bund should
include contour plowing, an appropriate crop rotation, relay cropping, intercropping and the
application of other soil management and agronomic measures that are consistent with the agro -
climatic conditions and farming systems of the area.
(ii) Check-dams: the functioning of check -dams or sediment storage (SS) dams in gullies should be
supplemented by the introduction of various plant species (including cash crops) on the gully walls
and on the deposited soil sentiments.  This may include, vegetative reinforcement along the check -
dam embankments for which sisal (Agave sisalana), euphorbia (Euphorbia spp), Erythrina (Erythrina
abyssinica), bamboo, and species with similar growth habits may be used. For gully sid e reshaping
and gulley filling Vetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides), Golden wreath wattle (Acacia saligna) and
other tree and fodder species can also serve well (see Annexes Part III, Annex 4). Specific grass species
for pure pastoral areas are provided in Annexes, Part II annex 3.
(iii) Water ponds: these should be provided with silt traps and spillways and should be fenced with a tree
or fodder belt. This acts as windbreak and as source of vegetation and flowers (for instance, pond
surroundings are suitable areas for bee-keeping).  Ponds should also be surrounded with a dry thorny
fence to prevent children and animals from entering the area, particularly during the first few years
before the vegetative fence provides an adequate barrier.
(iv) Trenches for tree p lanting: these should be excavated in a linear arrangement that will enable the
trees to act in unison in impeding water and wind movement.  When planting the trees a few handfuls
of manure or should be placed in the trench and after the rainy season a grass mulch should be applied.
Stabilization may be achieved by planting productive shrubs such as Pigeon peas ( Cajanus cajan) or
Sesbania (spp) and grass.
i. Integration in relation to micro -watersheds: The next level of interactions includes mutually
reinforcing activities and essential linkages between activities within a micro-watershed unit covering as
little as a few hectares. There may also be interventions consisting of multiple activities including area
closures. At this level of integration, it is essential to ensure that the measures taken perform effectively
and cause no damage. Box 3 provides examples of such interactions.
Box 3: Interaction at micro-watershed level
(i) Soil bunds: these should be integrated with cutoff drains and area closure above the cultivated area.
The area closure is by definition an integrated measure consisting of multiple activities such as:
controlled grazing; avoidance of human interference and introduction of use rights arrangements; soil
and water conservation measures to stop erosion and promote the infiltration of water; planting of
mixed species and biomass management.
(ii) Gully control: this must be integrated with treatment of the upper reaches (agai n involving closure)
and of the side slopes.  Where cultivated areas are involved this usually involves the construction of
bunds as well as the introduction of appropriate sharing and management arrangements. If large
structures are to be involved, there may be the opportunity to install shallow dug wells below a series
of soil storage (SS) dams and to support small-scale irrigation.
(iii) Community Water Ponds : Where the development of community water ponds is envisioned their
development needs to be integrated with upper catchment protection.  This again involves closure, and

[69]

gully control to avoid excess siltation and pollution of the pond.  The excavation of trenches may be
an integral part of such a closure.  These ponds can be designed in various forms based principally on
the type of soil in the closure area. Trenches can be integrated with eyebrow basins and other
conservation structures on the upper steep slopes.

ii. Integration of community watershed initiatives with the major watershed management : it is
essential to understand the interactions occurring and how to integrate the management measures being
proposed at this level in order to be able to guide the sequencing of activities and increase the range and
quality of the conservation measures being app lied.  This ensures the systematic treatment within and
between sub -watersheds and broader units. Other development requirements such as health centers,
schools, etc., should be considered as an integral part of watershed development in a major watershed.
These issues need to be addressed and handled in consultation with the respective Woreda institutions.
Box 4: Interactions in a community watershed
(i) The classic example of such interactions is related to water management. If, for instance, only few
hectares of hillsides are treated with trenches or other water harvesting measures for tree planting a
positive effect may be generated in terms of biomass production and tree growth.  The treatment will
not, however, generate significant results in terms of groundwater recharge. On the other hand, if, in
addition to the communal area within the community watershed, additional adjacent community areas
are als o treated, the combined effect of the treatments is likely to be very high and could generate
multiple large-scale effects.  This might for instance include sufficient replenishment of aquifers to allow
hundreds of households to access water from shallow wells providing them the opportunity to: engage
in horticulture activities; produce large amount of biomass for multiple uses (livestock, compost,
mulching, timber, firewood, cash crops, etc.); and protect infrastructure such as ponds and feeder roads.
(ii) Systematic and productive treatment of upper reaches also enables large gulley networks to be reclaimed
and become productive. This seldom occurs in Ethiopia except where the treatment is limited to small
and medium size gullies. The combination, however, of upper hillsides treatments and soil storage dams
(SS dams) can be used to convert larger gullies into excellent productive units, which can include small-
scale irrigation.
(iii) Such multiple effects also allow for adoption and expanded use of agricultural inputs, even in areas
previously considered degraded and of low productivity.
(iv) Even in watershed areas with higher potential and productivity their systematic protection and
effective management will have the effect of multiplying the range of crops that can b e introduced,
cultivated and marketed.

iii. Integration, linkage and sequencing interventions following watershed logic : The example given
under in Figure 14 below enables the practical visualization of possible interactions between micro -
and macro-levels of watersheds. It may also explain to DAs and communities most of the concepts and
possible interactions presented in various sections of the Guideline. The types of treatments that might
be considered in community -based watershed planning can be divided into the following three main
categories which are all linked to each other and intended to ensure a logical continuum of interventions.
1. Treatment of major watershed (A)
2. Treatment of sub-watersheds (B) within (A)

[70]

3. Treatment of micro-watersheds (C, C1, C2, C3) within (B)
The visualization exercise of watershed categories shown in Figure 14 starts from the watershed level and
moves progressively down to micro -watershed level. Table 9 starts at the micro -level and describes
interventions and linkages between progressively larger intervention units.
The measures explained on Table 9 highlight the interactions between land uses and watersheds.  In this it
should be noted that interventions for productivity intensification at homestead and farmstead level are
greatly influenced by the watershed approach. The number of homesteads that can embark on multiple and
productive activities increases exponentially, as a resu lt of watershed treatments within and outside the
boundaries of the communities.
5.8.4 Intervention areas: Description of measures and specific technologies

The measures listed below are organized based on the major agro -climatic zones and land uses. This
categorization is simply indicative as several measures has multiple functions.  Such is the case both for
forestry and fodder introductions which have roles in both water harvesting and soil conservation, and also
contribute to improved soil fertility and moisture conservation, etc.).  For practical reasons, however, they
are divided mainly on the basis of their primary or most relevant function.
The possible interactions between the different sub-watersheds of the main watershed is shown in Figure 14
below and the measures that can be adopted and their interaction with specific technical approaches is given in
Table 9.

5.8.5 Environmental and Social Screening of Interventions
5.8.5.1 PRINCIPLES
The annual action plan for implementation of the community watershed plan consists of a number of discrete
interventions planned, selected, scheduled prioritized by the communities.  These are referred to here as Major
Interventions for which the definition is provided in section 5.8.5.2, below. Although they are intended have positive
outcomes, Major Interventions have sometimes done more harm than good, as a result for example, of poor design,
selection of unsuitable locations, or a lack of integration be tween the Major Intervention and the surrounding
environment or community(s).
To avoid such problems, it is necessary to check that each Major Intervention is environmentally and socially sound
and sustainable. Fortunately, the specifications provided in  this CBPWD Guideline already include go od
environmental practices.  There are still, however, instances in which, depending on the environmental and social
context, certain technologies might require the incorporation of site-specific mitigation measures into the final design
so as to avoid negative impacts.  In these instances, the onsite check, carried out at the final Major Intervention design
stage, is known as ‘Environmental and Social Screening’, which we will abbreviate to ‘Screening’.
Screening should be the responsibility of a Woreda specialist, but she or he may delegate it to the DA.  Nevertheless,
supervision and overall responsibility for screening remains at Woreda level. Ethiopia has laws and regulations
addressing the environmental and social sustainability of such activities, e.g. Environmental Proclamations and
related guidelines, the National Policy and Strategy on Disaster Risk Management (2013), the Federal Policy on the
Environment (1997), the National Action Plan to Combat Desertification (2001) and the Climate Resilient Green
Economy (CRGE), all of which are considered during the Screening procedure.
Some Major Interventions might require application of specialized  procedures, for example those involving dam
construction or pesticides. Suitable procedures approved by the Ethiopian government for such Major Interventions
are annexed to this CBPWD Guideline.
In cases where a Major Intervention might have significant impacts that are complicated or difficult to predict, it may
be necessary for it to be reviewed at a higher level before the final design is approved.  When the screening procedure
identifies such Major Interventions as being of environmental concern they will be submitted to the Regional Bureau
of Environment and Forests (RB oEF) or its equivalent to establish whether an Environmental & Social Impact
Assessment (ESIA) is required. The procedures to be followed in such cases will be determined jointly by the
Regional or Federal Bureau concerned, and the agencies involved in the CBPWD program.  They will take into
account the requirements of the concerned Environmental Proclamation and related directives, the requirements of
EIA Directive 1 of 2008 ( Directive to Determine Projects Subject to EIA) , and the requirements of the program in
which the Major Intervention is being implemented.
It is recommended that in general, Major Interventions likely to lead to involuntary loss of assets or resettlement not
be included in CBPWD programs. But if they are included, they should be carefully managed and monitored by the
Kebele and regional authorities to ensure, at the very least, that all negative impacts are avoided or fully compensated
for and, and that no members o f the community are worse off than they were before the Major Intervention was
implemented. Attention should be paid to ensure that the social impacts of Major Interventions are positive and
appropriate for the affected communities, especially those identi fied as being and particularly vulnerable or
historically underserved.

[76]

5.8.5.2 DEFINITION OF A MAJOR INTERVENTIONS

To facilitate Major Intervention screening (and also M&E), it is necessary to determine, ‘What constitutes a Major
Intervention?’ Since some activities cover a wide range of micro -scale interventions, often taking place in close
proximity to each other, this important question needs to be addressed before the screening procedure can be finalized.
There is no ‘one size fits all’ answer to this question; each of the DA and the various NRM interventions will have
their own characteristics.
Where micro-scale activities with minor impacts are adjacent, they can collectively constitute one Major Intervention
for screening purposes, such is the case for rangeland development activities within a contiguous area within the
Kebele. But where one activity may have significant impacts of its own, such as developing a new water-point or SSI
project, each activity constitutes a separate Major Intervention for screening purposes. Clear definitions of what
constitutes a Major Intervention should be drawn up before the scree ning templates are finalized. In pastoral areas
the same principle applies. In this guideline, the major interventions subject to screening is described as follows: -

Note: * individual activities will not have social and environmental impacts, but as the cumulative impacts of many

5.8.5.3 SCREENING PROCEDURE

Part 1. Preliminary Screening
Each CBPWD program should classify major watershed-based interventions identified during planning into three
categories: Schedule 1, 2 and 3. According to Environmental Impact assessment guideline (2000), these different
schedules are described as follows: -
Schedule 1: Interventions which may have adverse and significant environmental impacts such as large scale land
reclamation, agricultural investments involving  resettlement of 100families or mo re, large scale agricultural

[77]

mechanization, introduction of new breed, species of crops, seeds or animals, surface and ground water fed irrigation
covering more than 10 hectares, drainage area of forestry lands or wild habitat covering an area of 10 hectar es or
more, river diversion and water transfer between catchments, etc
Schedule 2: Interventions having potential to cause some significant environmental impacts but not likely to warrant
an environmental impact study. Examples include: wide spread introdu ction of fertilizers, large scale pest control
programme, Surface and ground fed irrigation projects covering between 50 and 100 hectares, large scale protected
forest reserves, intensive cattle rearing (> 50 heads), poultry (>500), large scale livestock fattening and beekeeping.
Schedule 3: Interventions which would have no impacts and does not require environmental impacts assessments
such as all small-scale agricultural activities, surface and ground water fed irrigation covering less than 50 hectares,
small scale protected and protective forest reserves, rearing of cattle (<50 heads); poultry (<5000heads), small scale
livestock fattening and beekeeping.
Part 2: Check for Environmental Concern
This part will identify any aspects of the Major Interventio n needing a higher level of scrutiny before it can be
accepted and finalized. Typical issues could include major interventions:
• to be implemented close to areas of environmental sensitivity such as a national park, wetland of national
and international im portance, religious and cultural heritage areas, primary forests, areas which harbor
protected, threatened or endangered species
•  with dams;
•  involving the use of pesticides, which may require an Integrated Pest Management procedure;
•  involving medical waste; and
• with potentially significant negative impacts

Part 3: Detail Screening
This involves identification of possible adverse impacts and is conducted on site.  The likely extent of each adverse
impact is identified along with any mitigating measures re quired to avoid, minimize or manage it. If there are an
excessive number of high-level adverse impacts, it will be necessary to refer the Major Intervention to the Regional
authority for their attention. Otherwise the Screener will identify suitable mitiga ting measures for each potential
adverse impact. The Kebele or community proponent will designate a person to be responsible for ensuring the
mitigation measures are effectively implemented as specified, before, during and after construction. This will
normally be the DA.
Annexes Part III, Annex 3 sets out a suggested template for Major Intervention screening, including typical potential
adverse impacts that may need to be avoided, managed or mitigated in relation to various types of Major Intervention.

[78]

5.9 STEP 6: GETTING THE INTERVENTIONS APPROVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
The draft development plan must be prepared that indicates
the “what”, “where”, “when” and “how” of the selected
measures. It outlines recommended measures selected by the
CWT that are to be subsequently subjected to community
review. This review must happen in a general assembly of the
whole community in which t heir consensus and approval is
achieved with respect to the adoption and approval of the
proposed measures.  In this way the Communit y Watershed
Action Plan becomes a key document not only guiding the
annual planning process but also assuring the community’s participation in implementing the interventions.
Recognizing that climate change is not the only factor driving the prioritization of activities in the plan, a final check
is recommended to ensure that the final plan is climate -smart and responsive to the issues identified in the climate
analysis.  Once these steps, which are discussed again below, have been fulfilled the development plan to be finalized.
i. Discussion with the Community
The CWT representatives should present the plan to the community, discussing each of its sections in turn and
addressing the challenges encountered and the recommended solutions to these. The CWT should encourage people
to express their opinions and raise q uestions and should also do its best to maintain a gender balance within the
interventions.  It is very likely that changes to the plan and other suggestions will be introduced that were not
considered during the initial planning process.  It is also likel y that individuals and interested groups may change
their minds or introduce additional ideas and suggestions during initial meetings.  For this reason, sufficient time
should be taken, not only to discuss, but to agree on the measures to be adopted.  Part icular attention needs to be
given to those measures to be implemented on individually owned or usufruct lands.
ii. Discussion with the CWT from other communities
The CWT should also consult and reach agreement with the communities located upstream, downstream or otherwise
adjacent to them, about measures that need to be undertaken jointly to ensure that all watershed interactions are taken
into account and acted on. This step is essential as these measures are often the entry point for multiple benefits. The
role of the DA and of the Kebele level Watershed Team is especially important in the sequencing and prioritization
these activities that are of mutual benefit for more than one community. To complete this exercise, draft plans must
be revised so as to accord with the final agreement reached with the community. Each agreed measure/intervention
must be described in detail including selection, technical design, inputs required, schedule of activities and possible
expected benefits. See section 8.2.  Organizing Watershed and Rangeland Intervention Plan.
This is the step in which the Community Watershed Team (CWT) and Woreda planning team prepare the community
watershed development map, identify required inputs, set time frames for implementation, establish interim
milestones and share the final plan with all concerned bodies.
Step 6 Getting the Options and
Interventions Discussed and Approved by
the General Assembly
• Discussion with the community
• Discussion with the CWT from other
communities

from planning step 1 to 6 will be compiled into a
comprehensive strategic and operational plan. It
involves the preparation of development map,
determination of input requirement, detail action
planning, establishment of interim mile stone and
compiled full plan.
i. Development Map
The CWT must be able to identify on the ground the locations at which the various watershed development
interventions are to be implemented. This development map is therefore, an essential instrument for identifying the
actual locations and of all the types of development interventions and the existing land use types. This map will be
used during implementation to determine the extent of the areas involved and the volume of inputs required. Points
to be considered when preparing a development map include:
(i) The scale should be the same as that of the base map;
(ii) How the development blocks will be compartmentalized in accordance with phasing;
(iii) The locations of any major community assets and development works that have been previously
implemented;
(iv) The proposed development works, including maintenance or rehabilitation of existing measures;
(v) Symbols showing the development interventions and other necessary information;
(vi) A standard legend that enables the user to easily read and use the map.
Typical examples of a Development Map, symbols for watershed base and development map are shown in Annexes,
Part I and II, section 1.5.4.
Once it has been prepared an enlarged copy of the development map should be kept at the community and Kebele
level offices for purposes of monitoring and building ownership in the project.  As implementation proceeds the
community and Kebele should identify on this map the areas in which the work has been completed.
ii. Inputs
Once the preparation of the development map is completed, the next series of tasks include: (1) definition of the
appropriate activities to be undertaken in each land use area and withi n each intervention category; (2) estimation
and quantifying the work volume and required inputs for the multiyear plan as well as for the annual action plans,
indicating specifically the timing for the supply of inputs.  At this time the involvement and s upport of Woreda
technical experts is essential in order to minimize any exaggerated under- or overestimation in quantifying work and
input requirements for both multiyear and annual plans. The labor and material considerations that influence the
amount of inputs include: the personnel required, surveying equipment, construction materials, seeds, seedlings, etc.
The volume of these inputs depends on: the extent of the area in which work will be undertaken, the specifications
for the work, the slope gradient s, the soil texture and moisture and conditions and work patterns. For purposes of
convenience during both planning and implementation, it is helpful to complete the input requirement action plan
with the consent of the communities and using a table specifically prepared for that purpose.
iii. Action plan
The multiyear watershed plan is used as a foundation document for preparing work plans and outlines the activities
to be undertaken in years 1 to 5 (Annex 6).  It should be thought of as a strategic plan for achieving long-term success.
Annual work plans, on the other hand, focus on the specific actions that must be taken to achieve that vision. The
Step 7 Organizing watershed intervention plan
• Development map preparation
• Inputs for planned interventions
• Action plan preparation
• Establish interim milestones
• Reporting the prepared plan

[80]

multiyear action plan should be carefully and accurately developed on the basis of the agreements with the community
for the implementation of the proposed measures. It should include the first -year plan with complete details of the
activities to be taken quarterly and monthly basis.  At this stage the activities to be undertaken in subsequent years
(2-5) are essen tially strategic projections, to be adjusted and/or modified on an annual basis with the benefit of
experience gained during the previous years’ implementation activities and results. The action plan, including the
schedule, and should be arranged both in consultation with the community and with concerned experts who may be
more knowledgeable about the external supports and the types and availability of necessary resources.  It should also
embrace the overall capacity development needs of both men and women land users and development agents.
iv. Establishing interim milestones:
When designing an implementation schedule, it is important to establish interim milestones that will be used to assess
the implementation of the activities included in the watershed plan. The milestones are usually indicated against
relevant time scales: short-term (1 to 2 years), mid-term (2 to 5 years), and long term (5 to 10 years or longer). The
following table provides examples that could serve as a common milestone in watershed management
Possible milestones Time frame
---% of farmland area covered  with planned activities 1 to 2 years
---% of grazing lands with use plans 1 to 2 years
---number of new springs emerging or increased volume of water from existing springs  2 to 5 years
---% of degraded communal land rehabilitated and starting to be utilized with proper LUP in place 2 to 5 years
Production and productivity increased by ---% 5 to 10 years
% of communities reduced their risks of drought and floods (or % reduction of communities receiving
food aid)
3 to 7 years

v. Communicating/ sharing the plan
The watershed development plan should be submitted to the responsible organization in Woreda, and to the Regions.
The items to be included in it are indicated in the box 5 below. Formats provided in the Annex 6 can be used for
compiling the plan. If, however, the plan forms part of a project, a standard project report format should be used.
Box 5: A watershed development/management plan document
At this stage, a plan should be completed and include: problem identification, socio- economic survey, biophysical
assessment and base map, the development measures identified and the development map, input tables, an action
plan and a schedule for implementation. The following points to be included in the plan document:
 Essential information about the watershed (extent, geology and geomorphology, land forms, soils, rainfall and
distribution, vegetation types, settlements, population, land uses, weather and climate information etc.);
 Detailed descriptions of the characteristics of different land use types (limitations and potentials) of the sub -
watersheds;
 Descriptions of the proposed interventions for each land use type;
 Climate Smart Analysis of the selected NRM and Livelihoods integration technologies
 A detailed activity plan with the corresponding budget for inputs, labor, community contributions and transport
costs;
 Institutional mechanisms for implementation of proposed interventions;
 Community organizations or user groups that will be responsible for implem entation of the activities and
managing the results;
 Descriptions of the expected outputs and outcomes;
 Detailed mapping of present and post development land uses;
 Clear descriptions of the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders;

[81]

 Definition of training and other capacity development needs;
 The list of community and WWT members and their roles;
 Land use concept note describing the arrangements made for the utilization and management of the land during
and after rehabilitation;
 GSD and Nutrition mainstreaming
 ESMF application
 Capacity development interventions
 Person days, capital budget and input requirement estimation
 While the final planning document will consider all the topics mentioned above, the planners must make every
effort to ensure that the document is as brief, as clear and as handy as possible so that it is of maximum utility
to the implementer’s in the field


5.11 STEP 8: IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES

A work plan is the starting point for implementing watershed
development but first requires the development of an
implementation strategy involving: institutional/organizational
arrangements, resource identification and mobilization, activity
sequencing, c onsideration of gender and social aspects,
identification of links with other projects and programs, and a
capacity building strategy.

5.11.1 Organizational Arrangement at Community/ Micro-Watershed Level

Once the plan is prepared, the next step is to determine the labor and material requirements which are mostly financed
by the communities themselves. The assessment of labor requirements is based primarily on the established practices
of traditional work parties.  In this context the labor component may  be thought of as a “labor-based community
watershed contract”.  In this the resources are provided on the basis of self -help and/or other forms of assistance
which can be translated into person days. The total cumulative person days can then be taken up as a credit that the
able-bodied target group should “repay” to themselves or to the community as communal participatory actions, or
to other specific groups (e.g. selected female -headed households and households headed by elders) that they
themselves prioritize during a given year in terms of assets building for watershed development.  An essential step
is to explore with the community and the different target groups their preferred options for implementing
the watershed contract. This can be part of a simple but effective participatory planning exercise, with the precise
objective of making the best use of the contract that the group establishes for itself. The number of labor days
available can be used entirely for community works (one option) or split int o a combination of different sets of
activities. For example, a given number of the labor days can be dedicated to achieving community -based
interventions while other days may be set aside to build assets for needy individuals or to build their most productive
lands/assets. Simple but highly powerful mechanisms such as the wonfel and similar working party arrangements
can be adapted to fulfill such a contract and the preferred modality on how the target group will build such assets.
There are countless possibilities that might be explored within the context of any labor-based community watershed
contract.  The most appropriate should be selected on the basis of each local situation.
In rural areas, there is great variance in the degree of sophistication, purpose and of timing or duration of the activities
of traditional work parties, and even in the nomenclature used to describe them:  jigii (western Oromia), jighe
Step 8:  Implementation strategies
• Organizational Management
• Resource identification and mobilization
• Capacity building
• Link with other projects and programs

[82]

(Gurage), and debo (in most parts of Amhara). These arrangements often involve significant numbers of people, even
from relatively distant locations.  Other variations of the nomenclature also exist, however. In Gurage for instance,
there is a type of work party called awule which is applied to a full day’s work on enset planting and hoeing involving
an average of 10 people.  Another type of traditional work party, usually involving a few close friends and/or relatives,
coming together to fence, split wood, help in transportation, construct soil bunds, harvest grasses, hoe, plant enset,
etc.  This is known as known as daboo in Oromia, gaez in Gurage and wonfel in Amhara.  These all generally entail
immediate labor reciprocity.  The basic principle that draws people together in such an arrangement is the presumption
that working cooperatively increases per capita labor efficiency and ensures better quality outputs.

The following tasks and arrangements should be used for watershed planning and implementation.  These are based
on existing community work norms drawn from various parts of the country and from the implementation of
watershed development interventions under different projects and programs: -

(i) Watershed development participants should be organized in work teams consisting of a minimum of 10
people, but depending on the complexity of activities, possibly including as many as 30.  The work should
be assigned to the entire work team, not to an individual.  The number of work teams involved depends on
the nature of intervention. There may be only one at a watershed site or, for larger projects/activities, several
teams may be involved.  Each team should be allocated the work it is expected to complete.
(ii) The composition of work teams should take into account the local cultural, gender and social norms. Thus,
the teams should not to include: children under the age of 18, older persons over 60 years of age, the
physically or mentally challenged, pregnant women, lactating mothers during the first 24 months after birth,
primary caregivers of children under five who are moderately or severely malnourished, and other people
who are temporarily unable to work because they are sick or malnourished.
(iii) Menus for farming system specific activities should be selected that can be undertaken using self -help
resources and which would enhance household physical assets.
(iv) Households should be identified on whose holdings NRM activities can be undertaken in keeping with clearly
defined watershed logic.  This should be used to facilitate their organization into a number of Wonfel
groups/watershed teams, so as to ensure timely accomplishment of the activity.  The self-help activity should
be linked to any other form of available support in different areas (highly food-insecure, for example).
(v) The Wonfel group members should be urged to contribute in kind to the tasks being carried out within their
capacities and in accordance with the agreements made with them.
(vi) Eligible households should be identified for whom other assets are to be built using external support. The
amount to be transferred to eligible groups should be determined as well as the effect of payments on the
schedule.
(vii) Facilitate the accomplishment of agricultural/NRM tasks in and around the homesteads of disabled people
following the spirit of Wonfel.

5.11.2  Decision-Making and Role of Women and Other Vulnerable Social Groups and
Households

Watershed development should strive to ameliorate the position of women in general and female-headed households
in particular. This point is related to the tasks and arrangements outlined above but emphasizes the use of a
combination of self-help and other forms of assistance interventions to support women-headed households and other
labor-poor households. The case is also made for people who are unable to build significant assets through work but
who are able to manage them; for example, the elderly, the partially disabled, and others.

[83]

The first and most important aspect of involving women in the watershed management starts from ensuring their
active participation in watershed planning. They should be adequately represented in smaller planning units such as
the CWT and larger planning approval process (i.e. The comm unity’s endorsement of the watershed plan). This is
mainly because watershed activities identified and prioritized by women might differ from those prioritized by men
and other groups. The implementation plan should also consider the context of women and o ther vulnerable social
groups and households within the community. Watershed management should consider community support and free
labor contribution for the rehabilitation of degraded lands of labor poor female -headed households, people with
disability, elderly headed households and other labor -poor households.  The composition of the work team for
watershed management may be organized in two modes; mixed groups including both men and women, and
standalone women’s groups.  In both the many other family responsibilities falling to women must be respected with
flexible time arrangement such as allowances for late arrival and early departure to and from the watershed sites.  In
the case of mixed groups, women should be given half as much work as men and engaged primarily in less physically
demanding activities. In the standalone groups, women should be primarily be engaged in less physically demanding
activities such as nursery management.  Women who should be exempt from watershed development activities
include those who are pregnant and lactating and might be attending pre and post-natal courses, or those caring for
malnourished children under the age of five.  Childcare centers should  be provided at the work sites and the
appropriate breaks provided to allow for breastfeeding.

5.11.3 Link with Other Projects and Programs

It should not necessarily be assumed that the household contribution is sufficient to build the required assets on their
land holdings without additional support.  The feasibility of their being able to achieve this must first be verified on
the basis of local conditions.  Although some assets can be built using only the contribution of a local labor force, this
may not possible in the case of larger scale integrated and multiple assets. Efficiency in the undertaking of multiple
productivity enhancement functions can often only be achieved through economies of scale and integration between
activities.

Large parts of the country consist of degraded and food-insecure areas requiring the implementation of multiple, often
larger scale, activities in order to pass the test of quality.  The impacts of few small and widely dispersed activities
generally remain limited and ineffective for addressing the overall problems. The problems of households, however,
are multiple and interrelated and as a result the solutions should also be multiple and integrated.  Accordingly, the
vulnerable Woredas should plan on the basis of a broad network of properly selected and designed watershed plans
and activities.  These should be based on: the number of vulnerable people, their food gaps and other problems, the
priorities established with them and the available resources. This is very important because most of the food-deficit
and drought-prone areas, particularly in cultivated zones, are also the ones most affected by severe soil erosion and
experiencing the highest rates of land and other environmental degradation. Consequently, the main focus should be
on conservation and water harvesting initiatives, both to increase th e land productivity and to protect and improve
infrastructure (roads, water reservoirs, etc.).

The case for building a critical mass of assets to overcome food insecurity is very important and for this reason the
WWT, KWT and CWT should carefully and assess the conditions in the various land use zones to determine the need
for additional resources to treat degraded areas.  There may thus be differences between watersheds in respect of the
projects and programs selected to solve their respective problems.  It should also be kept in mind that planned projects
or programs in a given watershed should also contribute towards any adjacent and already designed multi -year
watershed development plans.  As with regular government activities, these three entities will also have to develop
their own annual work plans so as to ensure that the different intervention activities contribute towards common goals
as established in the multi-year watershed development plan.

[84]


Hence, whenever additional resources are received by their areas, the DAs should ensure that any work plans for these
interventions are aligned to the strategic plan of the respective Kebele. For example, at the moment there are programs
such as the Productive Safety Net Programme, the Resilient Land and Livelihoods Project, NGO activities on food
security and disaster management, and others working on watershed management. The resources made available
through these programs and others can only be used efficiently if they are integrated into the multi- year watershed
development plan.

5.11.4 Capacity Building

Capacity building is one of the major strategic elements for watershed implementation and can be approached from
three perspectives; individual, organizational, and systematic.

a. Individual Capacity Building
The activities identified and prioritized through watershed development include various conservation technologies
that demand an understanding of both the theoretical background and the practical application.  Hence, a strategi c
capacity building plan involving, training on various technologies, experience sharing, and various job embedded
capacity building activities should be included in to the annual watershed development plan. The identified capacity
building activities should be based on proper identification of needs and include a clear cascading plan to reach the
grass roots level implementers (CWT, DAs and Foremen/women).

b. Organizational Capacity Building
The building blocks for any organizations consist of the instituti onal arrangements, the physical facilities and the
human resources. The MoA has good institutional arrangements down to the grass roots level; however, technical
committees and task forces established to support watershed development at various levels need strengthening.  This
is particularly the case for the community watershed teams and the Woreda watershed technical committees who must
take on responsibilities for which they are not necessarily equipped or qualified and consequently have to be furnished
with the necessary physical facilities and technical skills.

c. System Development
The systematic approach to capacity building is fundamental to watershed development.  For this to be achieved there
must be a systematic approach to support both the individ ual and organizational capacity building.  All capacity
building materials for individuals should be developed on the basis of adult learning principles and be ready for use
before any training is conducted. The systematic component of the organizational capacity building should include
the following:
• A watershed development tracking system supported with GIS technologies;
• Clear procedures for compilation and documentation of best practices;
• Establishment of mini-libraries containing relevant catchment management documentation at Woreda/Kebele
level;
• Clearly defined physical resource inventory procedures for better allocation of resources.
Various findings from regular and ad hoc reviews and evaluations indicated that pastoral regions for example, Afar
and Somali, need special technical support to execute rangeland and watershed development activities to the required
standards. Capacity gaps prevailing in pastoral areas arise mainly because most front -line staff lack the required
expertise and/or skills in their fields and as a result the institutions are weak and lack the capacity to help respective
Woreda and Kebele staff develop the required skills.  This is largely because the harsh environment is a challenge to

[85]

the commitment of staff, which combined with the lack of proper induction methods and adequate retention measures,
results in high staff turnover and frequent loss  of competent staff. As a result, exclusive capacity building support
schemes need be designed to diminish capacity gaps in planning, implementing and monitoring of watershed and
rangelands development in pastoral areas. The regional governments these pastoral areas still need a comprehensive
and wide-ranging capacity building program to enhance their implementation capability and the competence of the
various regional experts down to the DA level

5.11.5  Establishment of Community Watershed Users Association

The need for, and composition of, the CWT is mentioned earlier (in step 2) as one of the key groups responsible for
overseeing the planning and implementation of watershed development activities at community level.  Despite many
positive results obtained usi ng these working arrangements frequent challenges and obstacles have however be
encountered, which have undermined their performance and demonstrated their limitations.  Included in these have
been the critical issues of their inability: to enforce local by-laws, to formally open bank accounts, to make contract
agreements for business, and to establish formal communications with other partners and government agencies.
It is essential to overcome these constraints as promptly as possible thereby enabling the  communities to be able to
effectively plan and implement their own watershed development activities.  The precondition for this is the creation
and legalization of the necessary community structures.  With these in place it is then essential to provide the capacity
development which will enable them to: identify and analyze problems; initiate planning activities; define financial
needs and financing mechanisms; and finally, to implement remedial measures and  management practices for the
sustainable utilization of the land resources in their watershed. Consensus has been reached both at regional and
federal level concerning the necessity and importance of these measures.
A principle means of institutionalizing and legalizing the CWT is to form a Community Watershed Users Association
(WUA).  This can be achieved simply by following the applicable national and regional level norms and regulations.
Once this institution has been established in consensus with the community, most of the responsibilities of the CWT
and additional responsibilities will rest with this association.  Depending on the financial and human resources
capacities of the community and available external supports, the association needs to conside r having office,
minimum administrative/financial staff and other personnel (e.g. a community facilitator).
The WUA must ensure or respected the following basic principles wherever there is voluntary provision of
participatory community labor in targeted micro-watersheds:
• Provision of labor will be based on watershed management plans prepared with and agreed by the respective
Community Watershed Teams (CWT) and approved by respective WUA;
• Labor incentives will be provided in the form of investments by the Woreda in community infrastructure, to
be identified in the watershed management plans through a community-driven development approach;
• Un-paid labor for implementation of watershed development and management plans will only be provided
by members of the respective WUA;
• Provision of labor for watershed development and management activities should not negatively affect
anyone’s ability to sustain their immediate or long -term livelihood, and should lead to direct or indirect
benefits for the participating households;
• The voluntary nature of the provision of labor will be documented; and

[86]

• The voluntary nature of the provision of labor will be verified through the Social Accountability Program at
the Woreda level.
5.11.6 Establishing User Groups
There are many IGA activities that result from watershed rehabilitation works and it is advisable to think about how
best to implement interventions such as the formation of user groups with an effective approach that ensures group
effort that will maximize the profitability and sustainability of their ventures. Examples of such ventures includes the
management and utilization of rehabilitated closed lands by otherwise unemployed youth groups who may be
engaged in beekeeping, livestock fattening or some other viable activities, which provides them with benefits while
ensuring the sustainability of the investments made in rehabilitating the closed area.  The group approach is also a
preferred implementation modality for expanding climate smart and risk reduction activities (CSA) on individual
lands.  This is particularly the case where technical support initiatives can be made more effective and efficient by
encouraging farmers with adjacent land holdings to engage in CSA activities as a group.
5.11.7 Sequencing of Activity Implementation
In the multiyear plan the implementation of the proposed activities should be phased sequentially over the years of
the project each forming part of a specific annual action plan and not be done randomly or haphazardly.  When
preparing annual watershed operational plan, it is advisable to consider the following minimum scientific and social
criteria for sequencing of activities.
• In the first couple of years it is wise to assign more importance to rehabilitation activities than to livelihood
interventions (For instance, water use interventions depend on the initial achievement of water harnessing
activities, likewise fattening activities are the result of achieving improvements in fodder biomass
production);
• Priority should be given to overcoming co nstraints that seriously affect health, as success in overcoming
these is likely to significantly boost the community’s commitment and interest (e.g.  If a community is in
dire need of clean water and there is the opportunity to re -establish a spring by re habilitating its recharge
area, this should be given priority).
• Considerations should be given to the available human and financial and resources and the community’s
level of commitment during the annual plan preparation: while it is good to be ambitious , it is equally
important to be realistic;
• There is great benefit to be gained from organizing experience sharing events between communities as apart
of capacity development activities, particularly where one community can offer exemplary organizational
planning and implementation experiences while the other is only initiating their watershed interventions;
• Care must be taken not to interrupt activities once implementation has started, as doing that might prove more
costly than not starting the work at al l (This is especially important where there are activities that must be
completed during a specifically planned period and which would be damaged if left for the next season - e.g.
check-dam construction without completing upstream water conservation struc tures, or leaving gullies
untreated on farmland and assuming that the labor and other costs will be covered by the owner).

[87]

6 PARTICIPATORY AND RESULTS BASED MONITORING, EVALUATION AND
REPORTING (P&RBM+E)
6.1 The Essence of Monitoring and Evaluation

One can readily understand the significance and importance of measuring progress towards the achievement of
objectives using predetermined and quantitative indicators from the statements provided below.These reflect the
thinking of development practitioners interested in making RBM+E an integral part of development interventions.
• If you don’t measure results, you cannot tell success from failure;
• If you cannot see success, you cannot reward it.
• If you cannot reward success, you are probably rewarding failure.
• If you cannot see success, you cannot learn from it.
• If you cannot recognize failure, you cannot correct it.
• If you can demonstrate results, you can win public support.

Thus, it is important to adopt this concept of measuring results for the effective management of watershed and
rangeland development interventions in contrast to conventional M&E system whereby the focus is activities
monitoring and reporting. Hence, in RB M +E the focus is both on activities and results measurement. This entails
that the CBPW/RD need to have an M&E system that shows logical relationship across the expected results from the
implementation of watersheds/rangelands management interventions at micro-watersheds and sub -kebeles
respectively, methods how to measure them and their use for informed decision making. It will also help to learn
from weakness, optimize use of limited financial resources and person days in the planning and implementation
process for effective and sustainable watershed and rangelands development.
Monitoring measures progress towards achieving a given plan, project, program or policy objectives.  It enables the
tracking of progress towards the achievement of the desired res ults over time and enables informed decisions to be
made regarding the integrity and efficiency with which the financial resources are being used and the effectiveness
with which planned activities are being implemented. It constitutes a periodic function over the course of the
implementation of planned activities managed mainly by internal institutions and their staff.  By doing so, it provides
timely and accurate information for the community, government bodies, development partners and other principal
stakeholders on the implementation status of planned activities/interventions, as well as progress towards the desired
changes.

On the other hand, evaluation measures the extent to which changes brought within watersheds or sub -kebeles is
because of the p lan/intervention under consideration or other factors. It is used to measure how well an
intervention/plan has met planned and expected objectives. In most cases, it is done by an external body with the
ability to provide an objective view of plan/project achievements. In doing so, the primary aim is to determine the
relevance and fulfilment of the objectives, development efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability of a given
watershed/rangeland development intervention. Thus, it is important to de termine changes in the community’s
attitudes and behaviour towards, and use of, their land, water, pasture and other resources that can be attributable to
the CBPW/RDP.

The basic reasons for doing evaluations are to confirm the policies under which the initiatives/plans have been
implemented, and to be able to answer public accountability issues at least in relation to the use of public finances,
but also in terms of benefits to the community. An important secondary purpose is also to be able to benefit from the
lessons-learned in planning and design, community involvement and implementation strategies, and resource
management issues, which can then be used in planning, design and management of future initiatives.

6.2 Setting the M&E System

In setting of the M&E system, it is crucial to follow systematic and agreed procedures, timetables and data collection
tools in relation to the achievement of specific and quantifiable pe rformance indicators.  In the case of an ongoing

[88]

development intervention it enables the financing and management institutions involved, or whoever has monitoring
responsibility, to provide timely and accurate information for the community, government bodi es, development
partners and other principal stakeholders on the progress towards the desired objectives.
Moreover, the M&E system will generate, aggregate and systematically record data and information from various
levels (Regions, Zone, Woredas, Kebeles and Community-watersheds) as well as qualitative and quantitative surveys
related to the project’s outcome/results indicators, implementation progress and performance, and project
characteristics. This information will be collected periodically to track implementation progress, identify bottlenecks
for quick resolution, monitor process quality and analyse results.
In order to monitor, evaluate and report watershed/rangeland development intervention successfully, the M&E system
should provide a proper guid ance on how to set watershed/rangeland development objectives, develop indicators,
determine baselines, set targets, design evaluation methods, methods of data recording, documentation and scaling
up, reporting and use of monitoring.
6.2.1 Determining Objectives

The watershed and rangeland development plan objectives are designed based on the problem analysis conducted all
the way through application of the participatory planning steps provided in this guideline. It is just like a solution for
the problems and cha llenges identified within watersheds and rangelands through community participation. The
overall objectives for implementation of a watershed/rangeland development plan/project or program will be depicted
in a hierarchical structure that will have the following (see hierarchy of objectives from table 11):
1. The Impact – is the ultimate objective of the plan/project/programme i.e. the sustainable change of status
among the beneficiaries such as improvement in HHs income, livelihoods and resilience to shocks in the face
of climate change
2. The Outcomes - represent the changes directly attributable to the successful establishment of organizations,
policies, programs or initiatives that singly or jo intly contribute to the impact . For example, increased
production and productivity of watersheds/rangelands (crop & livestock productivity) is part of an outcome;
3. The Outputs – represent the products and services derived fro m the activities of organization s, policies,
programs or initiatives that contribute to the achievement of outcomes . In watersheds/rangelands these
included developed water points for drinking and irrigation, areas of degraded lands rehabilitated etc;
4. The Activities – represent specific actions in capacity building, construction, the rehabilitation etc., that
singly or jointly contribute to the required outputs. For example, capacity building training on watershed
management, implementation/ construction of different soil and water conser vation activities constitute an
activity.

6.2.2 Setting Indicators and Developing Performance Management Framework

The M&E plan provides methods and approaches in which   indicators will be monitored and evaluated to ensure
effective M&E for the CBPW/RD. They may be quantitative measurable (measurable) or qualitative (observational)
although quantitative indicators are preferable as they provide more accurate and defensible measures of change and
progress. A performance indicator is neutral; it do es not indicate a direction or change nor incorporate a target. It
indicates how closely one aspect of an intervention is achieving its desired outcome. For example, yield per hectare
is an indicator that does not indicate nature of change nor a target.  The following themes should be considered in the
process of developing indicators:
• The number of indicators should be reduced to the minimum necessary to meet the key management,
learning, reporting and decision-making needs;
• Adequate time should be allocat ed in the planning process to engage stakeholder participation in the
identification of indicators;
• Should be done by competent personnel with the requisite expertise in the design and application of
M&E systems.

[89]

In relation to each indicator means of verification (MoV) must be identified which forms an essential element of the
M&E plan for the overall watershed/rangeland development plan.  It identifies the types of data to be generated, the
sources of data, the methods of data analysis, the frequency of data collection, the body responsible for data collection,
analysis and management; and use of information generated. This is summarized in what is called ‘Performance
Monitoring Framework (PMF)’ provided as an example and to be contextualized (see Table 11 below).
The PMF shows the indicators that will be used to measure the achievements of the impact, the outcomes, and the
outputs, how these indicators will be verified, how often and by whom.  Its use will address whether inputs and
activities incorporated in the w atershed/rangeland development plan are in compliance with design budget, work
plans, and schedules.

Once objectives with indictors and MoV defined, it is necessary to determine the baseline condition, set
targets and decide on the M&E system that should be adopted for measuring results.
6.2.3 Setting baselines
Baselines provide the essential quantitative or qualitative information on the conditio ns relating to the
indicators at the beginning of, or just prior to, the implementation of an intervention or watershed/rangeland
development plan (i.e. conditions of watersheds/rangelands before any initiative). It involves the collection
of data during or before the start of the intended intervention.  There may be indicators which don’t require
the collection of baseline data. In those instances, the baseline may simply be zero or may be reflected in
the achievements of the most recent year for which rel evant information exists or can be acquired. The
baseline requirement and data available in a community watershed/rangeland should to a large extent be
established using the socio -economic and biophysical survey conducted during the development of
watershed and rangeland strategic plan (Refer to annexes, Part III annex 5 ). For specific impact evaluations
detailed and separate baseline can be established or conducted as deemed necessary especially for indicators
that might not be included during the analysis in planning step 3. The Woreda watershed technical team &
DA are expected to summarize the data in a tabular form.
6.2.4 Setting targets

The targets indicate the planned level of results which are to be achieved within an explicit timeframe
(quarterly, annually, interim, or over a five -year period).  It thus consists of quantitative or qualitative
indicators of the results (at the level of impacts, outcomes and outputs) that the community, government
representatives (experts & DA) and financing organizations  want to achieve in a given time. In setting
targets, following considerations should be taken into account:
• Status of the baseline situation before the beginning of the intervention;
• Historical trends in the value of the indicator over time;
• Urgency and level of the development challenge based on expert judgments and research findings;
• Experience from other similar programs (lessons learned);
• Implementation capacity (community commitment, availability of external resources, available
expert-time, etc.).

6.2.5 Setting evaluation methods

One other important aspect of an M&E system is setting of evaluation methods on how to assess the
achievement of expected results associat ed with watershed and rangeland activities intervened at micro -
watersheds and sub-kebeles level. As mentioned above, the key variables to be considered in evaluation are
relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability of development interventions. For watershed
and rangeland interventions, the relevance measures whether the prioritized and implemented technologies
reflect communities need or not. Efficiency is all about whether the resources (human, financial, material
etc) invested for watersheds and rangelands development used optimally to achieve the desired objectives
(inputs used compared against outputs generated), while effectiveness is concerned with attainment of
objectives regardless of the way resources are used (outputs/results ge nerated compared against results
expected).
As to impact, in most cases changes brought by any interventions are determined based on comparing
treated watersheds/rangelands with untreated one (treatment vs control). But it is unethical to treat one
watershed/rangeland and leave the other for comparison purpose. Even it is more challenging in Ethiopian
context whereby all communities engage in the rehabilitation of their micro -watersheds and development
of rangelands, the so-called mass labour mobilization for natural resource management purpose every year.
Also, it is difficult to establish control sites due to varying agro -ecologies indicating that it is not possible

[92]

to establish control micro -watersheds especially for bio -physical impact parameters. Bu t, if conditions
allow, it is possible to establish such micro -watersheds for socio -economic impact variables. Thus, the
impact evaluation methods for assessing biophysical impact parameters should generally be based on what
is called dose effect analysis (analysing the differences in extent, quality and amount of interventions within
a given watersheds), or to focus on the with and without the intervention approach.
To do impact evaluations, a theory of change should be developed for a given intervention  based on the
expected and projected changes within the micro -watersheds and sub -kebeles. For example, biophysical
soil and conservation measures will have direct onsite, intermediate and long -term impact as described in
table 12 below which helps in the analysis of results expected to be generated from watershed and rangeland
interventions.

Also, as part of evaluation it is important to measure sustainability of watersheds and rangelands in order
to know what happens to community watershed development intervention and what determines the long-
term viability of implementation results. The sustainability of any project depends on whether the positive
impact justifies the investments expended, and whether the local community values the plan/project
sufficiently to be willing to devote their s carce resource to continuing with its support and maintenance.
The answer to this lies in knowing what motivates communities to continue to own and rehabilitate their
watersheds and rangelands after the completion and phasing out of intervention activities, which had been
implemented in their areas? This analysis can be done using the following four aspects of sustainable
watershed development:

• Technical Sustainability: The achievement of  technical sustainability is the most important
determinant of sustainable watershed rehabilitation. NRM interventions using proper standards for
the layout and construction of physical structures will result in greater operational success for the
rehabilitation of the environment. DAs should focus part icularly on the designs and standards for
the various intervention technologies described in this guideline
• Economic Sustainability: Economic sustainability of watersheds frequently depends on the
existence of ownership rights; i.e., whether the rehabilita ted gully, hillside or farmland is owned
communally or through legal certificate by a private individual or individuals. There are always
differences in sustainability of rehabilitated watersheds belonging to private individuals or those
owned by the commu nity.  In general, where these resources are in private hands they are more
sustainable than where they are under common ownership.  In order to ensure economic

[93]

sustainability of community lands therefore, it is essential formulate a community agreement on :
(i) how the rehabilitated environment will be utilized and protected  and (ii) how the benefits
derived from project intervention shared.
• Social Sustainability: Social sustainability is the ability of any social system, such as a community
in a watershed to indefinitely function at a defined level of social wellbeing.  Socially sustainable
communities are equitable, diverse, connected and democratic and provide a good quality of life
for its members. DAs and Kebele administrators need to ensure that developed watersheds should
have not to be a source of conflict, inequality and tension among the community and ensure the
establishment of watershed/rangeland users association.
• Ecological Sustainability: Ecological sustainability of a watershed can be determined by looking
at and analyzing the extent to which degraded land has been rehabilitated, with increased forest
cover, reestablishment of absent wildlife, improvements in rainfall patterns and increases in water
availability.

6.2.6 Data Recording, Documentation, Scaling up and Knowledge Management

In highly decentralized and demand-driven programs, a comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
system is very critical to assess and document timely progress towards outputs, outcomes, and intermediate
results. Moreover, it is important to identify implementation gaps and challenges for proactive corrective
actions; and document and incorporate lessons learned and captured during the implementation periods.
Under the context of watershed/rangeland development in tervention, monitoring and recording of
implemented activities starts at community level and expected to be done through conducting on site direct
observation, discussions and meetings based on annual watershed development plan.

Moreover, the quality of annual watershed plans developed at community level and later compiled at the
Woreda also generally do not meet quality standards. Lack of proper data recording and documentation at
the community watershed level has been identified  as one of the main causes for these challenges.  It is
essential therefore to establish working arrangement and to make available a simplified data recording book
or templates with traceable file documentation arrangements at both community and Woreda lev el. All
stakeholders must pay close attention to this starting from the planning stage. This includes the Woreda
Technical team, the DA and the CWT members. If this task is handled properly with a functional
participatory M&E process that includes timely a nd quality reporting the subsequent planning processes
will be easier and smoother. Frequency of data collection varies from one administrative hierarchy to the
other. Implementation status of activities at micro -watersheds will be tracked on monthly basis , while,
Woredas & Regions compile these achievements on quarterly basis and submit to the federal using quarterly
achievement reporting template (annex 7, table 7.1). As part of monitoring, the federal will organize a bi -
annual CBPW/RDG planning and imple mentation reviews based on per -defined survey tools. Similarly,
the federal will conduct a mid -term and final evaluation of watershed and rangeland development
interventions within sample micro-watersheds and sub-kebeles respectively.
Due attention should also be given to watershed/rangeland knowledge management to facilitate learning
and scalability of successful technologies across micro -watersheds/sub-kebeles, Woredas, and Regions.
The federal should have to adopt the SLM best practice compilation tech nique to document and scale up
technologies. NRM should have to generate both types of data; geo -spatial and non -spatial, thus
necessitating the establishment of GIS supported IT system for data management, dissemination and
communication.

6.2.7 Reporting and use of monitoring

As the prime purpose of M&E is to serve as a management tool, performance progress and findings and the
status of data collected must be reported on periodically, systematically and in a timely manner. The reports

[94]

produced are generally of two types: (i) those that compare watershed plans vs the actual achievements and
(ii) separate indicator reports for various levels of objectives (output-outcome-impact). The former has been
largely produced in NRM in the form of activities reporting. However, it has frequently been criticized for
being incomplete, inaccurate and for not having been submitted in a timely manner by the various
stakeholders. Thus, Regions, Zones & Woredas should make at most effort to ensure quality and timely
reporting at grassroots level.

As to the latter, generally there is limited attention as the focus is only on implementation activities. But
now a days there has been an increasing tendency to learn about results of implementation making RBM&E
central to development agenda. As per this new orientation, reports should also focus on indicators. At least
Woredas and Regions has to provide progress on output level indicators as far as the data is available in
their premises. As a guide refer to box 6 below on how to do M&E reports using indicators set to measure
watershed/rangeland interventions implemented at micro-watersheds and sub-kebeles level respectively.  at
Woreda and Regional level should be produced using contents provided in box 6 below.

The report needs to have reflection on the socio -economic and biophysical changes attributable to
watershed and rangeland development plan implementation. It should have to give enough descriptions on
the following key issues:-
• Identify what was achieved and what were the indicators of success;
• How actual results compare to expected results;
• Quantifying achievements whenever possible;
• Consistency (between sections);
• Balance (good and bad);
• Illuminating findings with quotes, testimonials, photos, etc.;
• The reasons for over or under achievement;
• Any unforeseen problems or opportunities that may require new strategies or a redesign of
initiative;
• The involvement of others (partners, stakeholders and beneficiaries) and degree of attribution
(if possible);
• Enough data to describe the effects of activities undertaken; and
• Clarity (inclusion of source)

The flow of information be it activities or indicators-based reporting should be from the grassroots level to
the higher as depicted in figure 15 below. There should also be a feedback mechanism that suggest for any
improvements in the reports coming from the grassroots level.

Box 6: Content of M&E reports
• Introduction (background to intervention, context of intervention area, purpose of report, M&E
questions, and information about goals and objectives);
• Methodology of the M&E (M&E focus, data and data sources, data analysis, when and by whom the
M&E was conducted, and limitation of the methodology);
• Key achievements of target activities, milestones and indicators in a tabular format organized around
major results;
• Major challenges;
• Conclusions and recommendations;
• Annex (pictures and case stories).

[95]


  FIGURE 11: REPORTING FLOW STRUCTURE
Reports at community level can be submitted using a simple tabular format with a few descriptions on
challenges faced and photos as an annex. The reporting can also be made on a monthly or quarterly basis
depending on the type of intervention and duration, but this needs prior agreement with all stakeholders. It
is advisable to organize a review meeting at least once every quarter at community level to discuss the
report and make corrective decision with the participation of Kebele leaders, CWT, DA, Communi ty
facilitator and selected community representatives. The Woredas should guide the DAs on the types of
reporting template used derived from the Woreda Quarterly reporting format provided in annex 7, table
7.1based on the specific conditions of watersheds and rangelands intervention types in their area.
M&E reporting at Woreda level is the responsibility of the Watershed Technical Team with the team leader,
thus the natural resource head or technical expert, providing leadership and coordination. It shoul d be
compiled at least quarterly and should show the performance of each community watershed.  Where
possible comparison between watersheds should be made and the specific locations of any particular lessons
learned identified. Review meetings involving oral presentations and discussions should also be organized
at Woreda level in the presence of the Woreda & Keble leadership, the technical team, DA, community
representatives and community facilitators to correct or improve on the work procedure is being ap plied.
The reporting should also include use of budget estimated based on capital budget utilized and market price
of forgone income from participating in community watershed and rangeland development using annex 7,
table 7.2.
The Zone and Regions are also responsible for monitoring of implementation as well as compilation and
consolidation of Woreda reports using quarterly activities reporting in addition to the indicators -based
reporting provided above. The Federal NRMD is responsible for having a central data management system
whereby it compiles and consolidates both implementation activities and indicators-based M&E reports.

1.1 VILLAGE/RESOURCE MAPPING EXERCISE

Figure 1.1: Village Mapping, Example
1.2 PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION AND RANKING
This is a relatively simple process in which a community group such the community watershed committee
can be assisted to achieve a consensus in prioritizing the order in which problems might be addressed or in
which any developmental options may and be acted on.  It involves taking the following discrete steps:
Step 1. The group must achieve a consensus on the problems which have to be addressed, or depending on
the situation, actions that might be taken towards taking advantage of local development opport unities.
These should be listed in  the format shown in Table 1.1 and not necessarily in any specific order of
perceived priority.
Table 1.1: Preliminary Problem Identification Exercise

opportunities Major causes Degree of severity Proposed solutions
Severe Medium Low
Problem No.1
Problem No.2
Problem No.3
Problem No.4
Problem No.5
Problem No.6 etc.
Problem ---

[99]

Step 2. Once consensus has been achieved amongst the group on the problems or opportunities that are to
be prioritized these should be listed as shown in Table 1.2 below. The problems (actions) should be assigned
the same order on both the horizontal and vertical axes.  For demonstration purposes we have chosen here
to s how seven problems.  Though, there may be more or sometimes fewer problems (actions) to be
considered.  The table should thus be expanded or reduced to fit the numbers that have been identified in
Table 1.1
Table 1.2: Example of the ranking of problems using a pair-wise ranking

Opportunities Problem 2 Problem 3 Problem 4 Problem 5 Problem 6 Problem 7 Score Rank

4 6/4 7 4 3
Problem 5

6 7 1.5 6
Problem 6

7 4.5 2
Problem 7

6 1

Step 3. After inserting the problems horizontally and vertically, the community representatives will engage
in a process of comparing the relative importance of each problem with every other one.  So for instance,
starting with the horizontal row for Problem No. 1, the group assesses which of Problem No.1 or No2 is the
more important. In this example the decision is that 1 and 2 are of equal priority (how we deal with equal
priorities will be further explained in step 4).  Now proceed to do the same assessment betw een Problem
No. 1 and No.3 (here No.1 takes priority).  In the next comparison it is No.4 which takes priority.  The same
process should then be followed horizontally in relation to problems 5, 6 and 7 and then down all the
horizontal rows below (in this example Problems No, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7).

Step 4. The next task to fill in the score column by noting the number of times a problem appears as a
priority in the ranking table.  Where problems are considered to have equal priority they may be assigned
half a point..  In this example, for instance, Problem 1 was considered to have equal priority with problems
2 and 5.  It thus appears (has priority) a total of two times Problem 2 has priority 2 5 times, Problem 3
never, Problem 4 has priority four times, Problem 5 has priority 1.5 times etc.
Step 5. The problem appearing highest number of times in the score column ranks as first and the others
follow accordingly.  In the event that two problems have the same ranking it is essential to look at each one
individually and for the committee or community involved to make a consensual decision on which one of
the two should be handled on a priority basis.

1.5 Bio-Physical Survey Methods
1.5.1 Watershed Delineation
The boundaries of a watershed in which planning, and management is to be undertaken can be easily
delimited with in which land use types can be identified and a development map can be prepared.  A number
of different techniques may be applied to delineate watersheds which include:
(a). Using topographic maps (commonly used at field level);
(b). Aerial photographs - on which better delineation can be achieved through the use of stereo pairs 9
(with scale larger than 1:15000);
(c). Field mapping using GPS;
(d). Digital elevation models and use of GIS software to delimit the watershed boundary.
Use of Topographic maps for wat ershed delineation: This technique is useful for enhancing the
participation of the community but is a somewhat slow approach with limitations in the provision of
accurate information. To successfully delineate a watershed boundary it is necessary to visua lize the
landscape as represented by a topographic map (See Figure 1.3 below). The following basic characters of
contours must first be understood.
Horizontal interval
Vertical interval
Steep slope – Contours close
together
Gentle slope – Contours
far apart
Convex
slope
Contour lines running
horizontally along slope
Concave slope
Imaginary lines projecting vertically from each contour line
Mountain
Valley

Figure 1.3: Surface relief as represented by contour lines
• The vertical interval between successive contours remains constant on any map (i.e. 100, 200, 300
etc.;
• Contour lines can never cross one another, because no point on the ground can be at two different
heights above the mean sea level;
• At some point on the map the elevation of the adjoining contour lines will usually be shown;


9 Sequential aerial photographs taken with a 60% overlap so that when the same surface features are viewed with
a stereoscope they appear as a single picture of the object, with the appearance of relief in three dimensions and

[111]

• Closer contour lines express steep slopes while those further apart show more gentle slopes;
• The spacing between contour lines indicates the land form and the slope gradient type;
• A slope having regular vertical intervals is called an even slope;
• If the gradient is close to the top of the slope and then smoothens out near the foot it is called a
concave slope;
• When the gradient at the foot of the mountain is steep and gradually decreases towards the top it is
called a convex slope;
• If the elevation of the successive contours increases inwards it shows a summit. Whereas, if the
elevation of successive contours increases out wards it shows a depression.

1.5.3 Land Capability Classification for Soil and Water Conservation Purpose
1. General
Being able to recognize the inherent characteristics and productive capabilities of land is essential to making
informed decisions about its various uses about the most appropriate types of soil conservation initiatives.
The concept of land capability, as commonly applied, refers specifically to the ability of the terrain
including the soils and its various associated characteristics (physical and chemical composition, depth and
gradient etc.) within a specific agro -ecological zone to provide essential services to humans such as crop
production, grazing and forestry.  It should be noted that this does not necessarily take into account the
other functions the land may have including, for instance, the capture of water for rivers, streams and aquifer
recharge as well as the provision of habitat for numerous other species.  In this case, however, the purpose
of the classification is to prioritize the urgency for the application of soil conservation measures.

The land classification system for soil conservation proposed here is based on Ethiopian experiences and
conditions. The range of characteristics of each land feature, which are used to assess the land classes, was
tested in the field in the  different agro -ecological zones of the country. The present land capability
classification for the purpose of soil conservation is taken from Javier Escobedo – 1990, which was
originally derived from work undertaken by USDA and FAO.  In these guidelines, details are given on the
principles and categories of the system, on the criteria and on how to observe measures and record the most
important features of the landscape and the soils . Particularly those related to the soil erosion and soil
conservation.  This land capability classification procedure is thus primarily meant for SWC– not for land
evaluation. Productivity/economic assessments are not made and the land  is classified based on its
limitations. The procedures for assessing these soil classes and d eveloping the recommended soil
conservation and management practices are described as follows.

2. Scope of its Use
The land classes should be considered as part of the conservation planning process but the approach
described here is more specifically designed for application in areas within a rainfall range of 400mm
<LCCs < 1200mm. It provides the ability to quickly read landscape features and identify appropriate
interventions. It can also be used as a tool to assess whether or not the land has previously been misused.

[113]

3. Principles
The soil properties and qualities presented here are essential for the design of physical and biological soil
and water conservation (SWC) measures.















FIGURE 1.6: ELEMENTS TO BE CONSIDERED IN LAND CLASSIFICATION

4. The Soil and Water Conservation Requirement Classes (SWCRCs)
There are 8 SWCRCs, Namely; I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII. The risk of erosion and requirement of
conservation practices increases from classes I to IV and VI to VIII. Class V is a special case and is for wet
lands.

Land Capability Unit (LCU) is the lowest category of the system having major limiting factors affecting
the use of the land for agricultural purposes.  These might be one or two of the following:
– Slope (L)
– Soil Depth (D)
– Past Erosion (E)
– Water logging (W)
– Infiltration (I)
– Texture (T)
– Stoniness (S)
SWCRC symbol + Major limiting factor(s) = LCU. Examples of LCU: IIL, IIIL, IVD, VIIE, VIIT, VIIID,
VW. Land Class Unit I is without any limitation.
5. Most Suitable Land Use for each SWCRC
This Land Capability Classification is also intended to identify the MOST SUITABLE LAND USE for
each SCRC. The following tables provide the criteria for establishing the SWCRCs and how the limiting
factors should be applied in establishing the appropriate codes.

Table1.28 land suitability classes for specified uses.
SCRC Suitable Land Use
I, II, III, IV Land, suitable for annual crops

8.How to use the land classification table to determine the SCRC
The land classification table presented below is designed to enable the field staff to identify the land classes
in a standard and objective way. The procedures for the use of this table are:

a) Use the data collected in the field and code it on a SOILS/LANDFORM DESCRIPTION FORM
applying the criteria outlined in Tables 1.27 to 1.35
b) Start at the top left hand corner of Table 1.36 (SLOPE) and find the first  occurrence of the slope
category recorded in the field, moving from left to right.
c) Proceed down in the same column to the next feature, if the data recorded is within the range
allowed, to the next feature. If not, move to the right along the line until you find the correct range.
You cannot go back to the left!
d) Follow this procedure for all the features and you will reach the SOIL CONSERVATION
REQUIEMENT CLASS at the bottom of the table.
Remark:
• For simplicity the range of codes allowed in a column is shown. For example as 1-7 inclusive (i.e.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7) is allowed and the user can proceed vertically provided the code is within the
stated range.
• If the column for the slope is subdivided into two, you have to continue in that sub-column when
you reach SOIL DEPTH.

8. Selection of SWC Measures for each LCU
In order to identify the appropriate conservation measures that should be taken within any land unit the
following procedures should be adopted:
• Undertake land classification exercise and determine land class unit (SWC requirement class +
limiting factors);
• Check the present land use;
• Check LCU against present land use assessed above;
• Select one or more SWC measures, seemingly appropriate within existing conditions;
• Submit/communicate the list of measures to farmers and negotiate.
Potential SWC inte rventions that can be selected and recommended according to the land capability
classification and present land use are given in table below.

PART II: ANNEXES FOR PLANNING IN PURE PASTORAL
AREAS
ANNEX 1. SOCIOECONOMIC AND BIOPHYSICAL SURVEY TOOLS
1.1 VILLAGE/RESOURCE MAPPING EXERCISE

Figure 1.1. Village/resource Mapping (left), Example,
livestock movement route map (right)

1.2 PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION AND RANKING
This is a process in which a community group such as village or sub kebele community committee or KRT
can be assisted to achieve a consensus in prioritizing the order in which problems might be addressed or
in which any developmental options may be acted on.  It involves taking the following discrete steps:
Step 1. The group must achieve a consensus on the problems to be addressed, or depending on the
situation, actions that might be taken towards taking advantage of local development opportunities.
These should be listed i n the format shown in Table 1.1  and not neces sarily in any specific order of
perceived priority.

Table 1.1. Preliminary Problem Identification Exercise
Problems or
opportunities Major causes Degree of severity Proposed solutions Severe Medium Low
Problem No.1
Problem No.2
Problem No.3
Problem No.4
Problem No.5
Problem No.6 etc.

Step 2. Once consensus has been achieved amongst the group on the problems or opportunities that are
to be prioritized these should be listed as shown in Table 1.2 below.  The problems (actions) should be
assigned the same order on both the horizontal and vertical axes.  For demonstration purpose s we have
chosen here to show seven problems.  Though, there may be more or sometimes fewer problems (actions)
to be considered.  The table should thus be expanded or reduced to fit the numbers that have been
identified in Table 1.1.

[125]

Table 1.2.  Example of the ranking of problems using a pair-wise ranking
Problems/
Opportunities Problem 2 Problem 3 Problem 4 Problem 5 Problem 6 Problem 7 Score Rank
Problem 1 1/2 1 4 1/5 6 7 2 5
Problem 2  2 2/4 2 6 7 2.5 4
Problem 3   4 5 6 7 0 7
Problem 4    4 6/4 7 4 3
Problem 5     6 7 1.5 6
Problem 6      7 4.5 2
Problem 7       6 1
Step 3. After inserting the problems horizontally and vertically, the community representatives will
engage in a process of comparing the relative importance of each problem with every other one.  So for
instance, starting with the horizontal row for Problem No. 1 , the group assesses which of Problem No. 1
or No2 is more important. In this example the decision is that 1 and 2 are of equal priority (how we deal
with equal priorities will be further explained in step 4) .  Now proceed to do the same assessment
between Problem No. 1 and No.3 (here No.1 takes priority).  In the next comparison it is No.4 which takes
priority.  The same process should then be followed horizontally in relation to problems 5, 6 and 7 and
then down all the horizontal rows below (in this example Problems No, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7)
Step 4. The next task to fill in the score column by noting the number of times  a problem appears as a
priority in the ranking table.  Where problems are considered to have equal priority, they may be assigned
half a point.  In this example, for instance, problem 1 was considered to have equal priority with problems
2 and 5.  It thus appears (has priority) a total of two times problem 2 has priority 2.5 times, Problem 3
never, Problem 4 has priority four times, Problem 5 has priority 1.5 times etc.
Step 5. The problem appearing highest number of times in the score column ranks as first, and the others
follow accordingly.  If two problems have the same ranking it is essential to look at each one individually
and for the committee or community involved to make a consensual decision on which one of the two
should be handled on a priority basis.

1.5 BIO-PHYSICAL SURVEY METHODS
1.5.1 KEBELE/SUB-KEBELE/VILLAGE DELINEATION
The boundaries of a Kebele/sub kebele/village in which planning and management is to be undertaken
can be easily delimited with in which land use types can be identified and a development map can be
prepared.  A number of different techniques may be applied to delineate Kebele/sub kebele/village
which include:
Using topographic maps (commonly used at field level);
Aerial photographs - on which better delineation can be achieved through the use of stereo pairs10 (with
scale larger than 1:15000);
Field mapping using GPS;
Digital elevation models and use of GIS software to delimit the Kebele/sub kebele/village boundary.
Kebele/sub kebele/village delineation:  Identification and mapping the targeted Kebeles and
communities in the woreda is carried out by using 1: 50,000 topo maps, GIS tools and the collective
knowledge of woreda experts. The delineation/boundary of the Kebele/sub kebele/village and specific
sites will be verified and corrected with ground checking during the reconnaissance visits at Kebele and
community level. Kebele/sub kebele map may contain land use, location and size of rangelands, water
points, settlements, and may also be possible to mark major drainage courses (consisting of
rivers/streams, other drainage lines) as well as features of land degradation, location and area coverage
of invasive species, etc.

[133]

It will also be important to delineate the broader rangeland boundaries within which the selected
Kebele/sub kebele is located and see how they overlap, and anal yse the major interactions within and
between Kebele communities within the broader rangeland unit. This exercise helps in validating the
selection and reaching agreement over boundaries and resources to be included . In communal
rangelands, this is an impo rtant step for ensuring that a suitably large -scale approach is used, breaking
out of highly localized and village -level planning. Engage knowledgeable elders/ clan leaders to explain
the trends and changes in recent years, as well as brief on the historic al context and any relevant details
prior to beginning the mapping exercise e.g. identify interesting features and characteristics that influence
mapping and management, such as seasonal grazing areas, drought reserves, corridors, water points,
patterns of mobility (livestock and people) both within the Kebele and the broader rangeland area, etc.
Proceed to the field and delineate the location of these features and locations of gendas/ villages/
communities within the Kebele/sub kebele.
1.5.2 HISTORY OF RESOURCE USE AND MANAGEMENT
Carry out trend analysis using the table below: changes in resources, their management/ use, problems
associated with these changes and the overall direction in which the community is moving. Using the
different PRA techniques such as the time line/ trends analysis methods, one can get a historical review
of the community and find out what the major events were, their causes and how they have impacted the
community. The trends of changes in resource use and management  (trends analysis), problems
associated with these changes and the overall direction in which the community is moving. This is followed
by inventory and assessment of resources (people*, land, water, vegetation, livestock, etc.):

PART III: PLANNING ANNEXES FOR BOTH MIXED FARMING AND
PURE PASTORAL AREAS
ANNEX 1: WATERSHED CLIMATE ANALYSIS, PRIORITIZATION AND SCREENING
Step 1: Climate Change Context: Identify and document climate change observations and projections
from both scientific sources and community knowledge. Consult secondary sources, such as the National
Adaptation Plan, for scientific observations. For the community observations, refer to t he discussions on
the Seasonal Calendar and the Historical Timeline from step 4 & 5 watershed climate analysis below.

Observations of Climate Change Future Climate Change Projections
Community Observations (at watershed/ kebele
level)


Scientific Observations (INDICATE SCALE)


Step 2: Sensitivity of Livelihood Resources to Climate Impacts: List livelihood activities and resources
needed for each livelihood activities. Then use the table below to analyze the sensitivity of the liveli hood
resources to climate impacts.  Assign each resource a ranking: 0 = Not sensitive at all, 1 = Low sensitivity
to climate impacts, 2 = Medium sensitivity to climate impacts, 3 = High sensitivity to climate impacts

Livelihood Activities Resources Needed for
Livelihood Activities

(0 = None, 1 = Low, 2 = Medium, 3 =
High)
Women’s Livelihood Activities Resources Important to
Women’s Livelihoods



Men’s Livelihood Activities Resources Important to Men’s
Livelihoods



Step 3: Vulnerability Matrix (VM): Identify climate related hazards (e.g. drought, flood, erratic rainfall,
heavy rainfall, etc.) affecting the identified livelihood resources. Determine the effects of these hazards on
the resources. Rate the level of effects as 3 = significant impact, 2 = medium impact 1 = low impact, 0 =
no effect on resource . Hazards must be ranked through community discussion using pair wise ranking
technique discussed in step 3 of the planning step.
Livelihood

Hazard 1 Hazard 2 Hazard 3 Hazard 4





Step 4: Historical Timeline : The objective here is to get an insight into past hazards, changes in their
nature, intensity and behavior, make people aware of trends and changes over time and document
community observations of changing hazard trends. It is advisable to have the same material as in the
previous analysis.

[139]


Year Event Year Event





Step 5: Seasonal Calendar: This is to analyze seasonal changes in activities and periods of stress or
scarcity, to identify important livelihood activities, document community observations of changing trends
in seasonal patterns and to highlight the increasing uncertainty associated  with climate change. It is
advisable to have the same material as in the previous analysis.

Step 11:  Prioritized Watershed/ Rangeland Management Interventions and Livelihoods Options
Based on the previous three steps, list the prioritized watershed management interventions and livelihoods
options in the table below.  These are the activities that should be included in the action plan.  Where
activities are linked (from Step 7– Proposed Interventions to Reduce Climate Change Vulnerability), list
them side-by-side.  These priorities must be combined with priorities identified based on problem analysis
and solutions to decide which interventions will be included in the Community Watershed/  Pastoral
Community Action Plan.

Prioritized Watershed/ Rangeland
Management Interventions
Prioritized Livelihoods

Other interventions



Step 12: The Climate Screening of Community Watershed/ Pastoral Community Action Plan: It is a
final check on the Community Watershed/ Pastoral Community Action Plan, to ensure that the climate -
smart priorities have not been lost when combined with other priorities ( under Section (i) - Compiled
Socio-economic and Biophysical Analysis Result s), and to look at the plan in its entirety to ensure it is
addressing different dimensions of vulnerability to climate change, achieves mitigation co -benefits if
possible and is gender-sensitive. To do this, consider the following points to adjust the action plan.
No Key questions/ points to consider Answer
1  Does the plan include interventions that reduce exposure to climate-related hazards identified in
the Climate Analysis?

If yes, which interventions?  If no, explain why not.
2  Does the plan include interventions that reduce sensitivity of livelihoods to climate impacts
identified in the Climate Analysis?

If yes, which interventions?  If no, explain why not.
3  Does the plan include interventions that enable risk management and climate change adaptation in
livelihoods?

If yes, which interventions?  If no, explain why not.
4  Does the plan include interventions that achieve climate change mitigation co -benefits?
If yes, which interventions?  If no, explain why not.
5  Were future climate scenarios taken into account in the development of the plan?
If yes, how?  If no, explain why not.
6  Does the plan address the needs and priorities of both women and men?
If yes, how?  If no, explain why not.
7  Based on the responses to the above questions, provide an overall assessment of the plan in terms
of how climate-smart it is. Suggested scale:
Answered yes to 1-2 questions: Weak
Answered yes to 3-4 questions: Medium
Answered yes to 5-6 questions: Strong

ANNEX 3: PREPARATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT
FRAMEWORK

3.1 STEPS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SCREENING
In order to avoid or mitigate any undesirable impacts during watershed development projects, it is
essential to maintain a high level of environmental. This is achieved through the implementation of the
environmental and social management framework (ESMF) or initial environmental examination (IEE).
It helps to ensure that appropriate natural resources and environmental management practices are
integrated into watershed development planning and implementation activities. The ESMF/IEE
checklist is used for different activities, including small scale projects such as: water harvesting, small
scale river diversion, irrigation activities, community road construction, catchment treatment, etc.  The
following project screening checklists should be applied as per the definition of what constitute major
interventions subject to such scrutiny to analyse the environmental impacts of integrated watershed
interventions and assure the social integrity of the community.
Step 1: Preliminary Screening: Classifying major interventions into different categories*
Major Interventions  Tick Yes/No
According to preliminary classifications of the
major interventions during screening
Schedule 1 Schedule 2 Schedule 3
Integrated physical and biological Soil and Water
Conservation
Wind Erosion Control Measures
 Structural Water Harvesting
Water Lifting Technologies
Small Scale Irrigation and Water Management
Homestead and Livelihood Intervention
Range Land Management Practices
Feeder Roads
Note that: to classify major interventions into the different schedules refer to the preliminary
screening section in the body of the main text

Step 2: Check for Environmental Concern
Name of Major Intervention: ________________________________________
Sub-Activities: ____________________________________________________
Check for environmental Concern Yes/No
to be implemented close to areas of environmental sensitivity such as a national park,
wetland of national and international importance, religious and cultural heritage
areas, primary forests, areas which harbor protected, threatened or endangered
species

Other (specify):

Categorization of impacts
Low:  When the impacts of development activities have an insignificant effect on the ecosystem and
socioeconomic activity of the people. E.g.  When the construction of community road results in
minimal soil erosion, which can be easily managed by the farmers, or there is damage to farmland is
very minor and easily repaired.
Medium:  Any impact between the two extremes (high and low) can be categorized under medium
level.
High:  When the impact of development activity has a significant effect on the ecosystem and/or
socioeconomic activity of the people. E.g. If the construction of community road creates gullies,
erodes farmlands, or floods villages then the impact is high.

 Template for recording environmental/social impacts
B. Mitigation measures
If high or significant impacts are identified for any of the above environmental effects, describe mitigation measures for each
identified high impact. If the impact is unknown further investigation is required.

Step 6. Marketing plan
The livelihood development activities are primarily for market.  For example, in the case of fattening, the product is
100% for market. In the case of dairy, much of the milk and milk bi-products (say 75%-80%) should be made available
for market.  The reason behind this is that the finance used for investment (based on the business plan) is either fully
or partially a loan with agreed interest rate from the financial institutions. Therefore, Community members are
expected to repay principal plus interest based on agreed loan repayment schedule.

[157]

However, it should be noted that it is the HH who decides what proportion of the total production to sell, when to sell
and where to sell. In the case of fattening, the decision is straightforward. It should be sold at the right time (e.g. during
festive/holiday seasons such as Christmas, Easter, New Year,). Similarly, if the products are perishable, then they have
to be sold immediately.
Therefore, it is imperative to consider how households differ in their operati ons from firms and what actions can be
taken to support their transformation into enterprising household units.
o Market analysis should be done before a business commence by using input from VC analysis
o The market analysis will demonstrate that there is market for Community members’ products.
How much would you expect to sell from the total production and where do you plan to sell?
o The business’s products: What goods or services will I sell?
o The business’s customers: Who will buy my product or service?
o The place of business: Where will the business be located?
o The competition: What other businesses sell similar goods/services in my area?
o Promotion: How will you let customers know about your products/services?

Step 7:  Revenue and expenditure by month and quarter
Accurate recording of revenue and expenditure is good practice of any BP.  The client should know how much is spent
on the plan and when it is spent; how much is earned and when it is earned.  This will generate a cash flow of the plan
and helps for busine ss decisions.  This practice is fundamental to institutionalize business planning among rural
households in general and business-oriented community members in particular.

[158]

The format requires that the revenues and expenditures be recorded monthly and summarized for each quarter,
demonstrates monthly templates/format).  In the hypothetical and simplified example given below, it is assumed that
a fattening scheme has three rounds:
o The business oriented HH constructs shelter, purchases ox, buys some feed and pays for veterinary expenses
during the first quarter.  This brings the first quarter expenses to Birr 3,750.
o During the second quarter, the he/she purchases additional feed and by this time, the ox is ready for sale.  It
is sold for Birr 8,000 and the HH purchases an ox for Birr 3,500 in Round 2.  In each quarter, the HH should
have an idea if the business is on the right track.  However, the BP should give the expected overall
performance of the business (profit or loss) at the end of the year as indicated in the Table K  below.
Accordingly, this hypothetical HH appears to be profitable.  Although these are planning figures, they should
be based on realistic prices considering expected increase in prices.
