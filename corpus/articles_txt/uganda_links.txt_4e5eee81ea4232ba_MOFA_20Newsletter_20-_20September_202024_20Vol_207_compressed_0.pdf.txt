EY,
DEAR ESTEEMED READERS,
Welcome to the latest edition of our newsletter.
September is one of the busiest months on the MoFA calendar. The
Multilateral hallways have been humming with the sound of positions,
outcome documents, negotiations, agreements, tete-a-tetes, courtesy
calls and side events and we have a few snapshots for you of the
myriad meetings that the Uganda Delegations were engaged in from
TICAD to FOCAC to the 79th UNGA high-level week.
Marking Tourism month, from Beijing to Guangzhou to Paris and Tokyo
our Missions have been busy, working with the Uganda Tourism Board,
the Uganda Coffee Development Authority and Uganda Breweries to
promote Uganda’s beautiful scenery, delightful people, culture and
heritage.
September saw the Uganda-Mozambique Joint Permanent Commission
successfully concluded with a number of MoUs signed. We joined
Uganda Airlines to mark their 5th birthday as they celebrated their
inauguration of flights 13, 14 and 15, Arusha, Lusaka and Harare and
brilliantly marrying each launch with a Business Forum to discuss the
opportunities available. Any traveler who has ever had to travel 10 hours
to get from Entebbe to Lusaka via Addis Ababa will appreciate the two
to three hour alternatives offered by Uganda Airlines.
Now for the fun part, September saw us engaged in the Uganda Film
and Culture Market, engaging in discussions on authenticity in
storytelling and discussing the business of film as an industry. Details
are in this issue.
Do not miss our sports diplomacy page as we celebrate the JICA
football game against the Jinja Queens.
With this issue, Diplomatic Notes editorial team bids farewell to our Art
Director, Mr. Ivan Koreta who has been the heart and mind behind the
brilliant design and who has been with us since issue 1. While we are sad
to see him go, we are proud to see him rise to greater heights.
Godspeed Ivan.

VP Jessica Alupo Reaffirms Investment Opportunities for China in
Uganda, during meetings at the FOCAC 2024 in Beijing.
Beijing - Uganda's Vice President H.E. Maj (Rtd)
Jessica Alupo reaffirmed the country’s openness to
foreign direct investments, welcoming partnerships
from Chinese investors and collaborations between
investors and the Ugandan government.
She made these remarks on September 3, 2024,

Uganda-DRC Border
Reaffirmation: A Pathway to
Stability & Economic Growth.
Goma - From  2nd to  6th  September 2024, Senior
Officials from the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) and Republic of Uganda held a significant
Joint Technical Committee (JTC) meeting in
Goma, aimed at reaffirming their common border.
The meeting, organized in close cooperation
between the two governments, took place in a
cordial environment, free from security threats,
allowing for constructive discussions. The Ministry
of Foreign Affairs of Uganda played a central role
in coordinating Uganda’s participation, ensuring
the successful execution of this crucial diplomatic
engagement.
A major achievement of the meeting was the
development of a comprehensive roadmap and
budget for the reaffirmation of approximately 817
kilometers of the shared Uganda-DRC border.
This effort is vital for maintaining peaceful
relations and clear demarcation between the two
countries. To date, only 44.8 kilometers of the
border have been reaffirmed, specifically the 28-
kilometer stretch from Offo/Vura and the 16.8-
kilometer section from Sarambwe/Bwindi. These
milestones reflect progress, though there is still
much to be done to fully reaffirm the entire
border.
One of the critical discussions involved the
clarification that 22 Uganda Investment Authority
(UIA) pillars along the Kisoro/Bunagana area are
not boundary markers. This discovery resolves
potential disputes and highlights the importance
of technical expertise in such exercises. The
Ministry of Foreign Affairs facilitated the dialogue
that enabled this issue to be addressed in a
diplomatic and transparent manner.
The reaffirmation exercise, once completed, is
expected to strengthen cross-border cooperation,
create a detailed topographic map of the border,
and install permanent boundary pillars. The joint
field activities for this exercise are projected to
cost USD 3,142,260, with Uganda and the DRC
agreeing to share the expenses.
...story continues on next page.

Tête-à- TêteTête-à- Tête
Previous budgetary allocations for boundary reaffirmation in Lake Albert and Lake George, discussed during a
2018 meeting in Entebbe, also provide a framework for financial planning. These efforts are part of a larger
commitment to regional stability and cooperation, areas in which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs continues to
be instrumental in advancing Uganda’s interests.
Looking ahead, the JTC has agreed to begin the reaffirmation exercise in May 2025, with a follow-up meeting
to be held in Kampala. This timeline reflects the long-term nature of border management and the ongoing
need for careful coordination, a role that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to oversee.
In addition to border reaffirmation, the meeting shed light on economic opportunities in Goma, which, despite
ongoing security challenges, has emerged as a key economic hub. Several Ugandan companies, such as
Movit and Lato, have already established a strong presence in the region, benefiting from the market potential
of the densely populated Kivu area.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through its economic and commercial diplomacy initiatives, has been pivotal in
supporting Ugandan businesses to explore and capitalize on these opportunities. A well-organized business
forum in Goma, facilitated by the Ministry, would further expose Ugandan traders to the potential for market
expansion.
However, security concerns remain a challenge for trade, with many traders having to use longer, less secure
routes, impacting their business operations. Despite this, the region’s demand for Ugandan agricultural
products remains high, making it a lucrative market for continued engagement.
The JTC concluded with several important recommendations. The governments of both Uganda and the DRC
were urged to allocate the necessary funds for the border reaffirmation exercise. Additionally, a joint military
effort was proposed to clear and secure the border areas before and during the reaffirmation process. These
recommendations underscore the collaborative approach needed to ensure a successful outcome, with the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the forefront of steering these efforts toward mutual benefit.

Entebbe Municipal Council has unveiled plans to launch a metro bus service connecting Kampala with
Entebbe International Airport, aimed at modernizing public transport and improving connectivity.
The Entebbe Mayor Fabrice Rulinda highlighted the initiative's goal of enhancing travel for residents and
visitors, particularly for airport commuters who currently face difficulties, such as walking long distances with
luggage. The metro buses will provide a direct, comfortable route to the airport, alleviating these challenges.
The project, aligned with Uganda’s urban mobility objectives, seeks to offer world-class infrastructure that
benefits both tourists and locals. Though local taxi drivers have raised concerns about competition, the
council assures that the metro service will complement existing transport, not replace it.
The buses will run on a schedule, coordinated with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), and drivers under
training to meet international standards. With an initial fleet of 20 buses already in place, the service is set to
launch on October 9 2024.
This initiative positions Uganda alongside global cities like New York and Tokyo, which offer efficient airport
transit. It also reflects Uganda’s commitment to sustainable, green transport and its ambition to remain
competitive as a growing destination for tourism and international business.
Using the same platform, the State Minister for Kampala Capital City and Metropolitan Affairs, Kyofatogabye
Kabuye, said the majority of the taxis in Uganda are costly, inefficient and unreliable in terms of time-saving.
“Through the launch of the Metro buses that will commute from Entebbe Airport to Kampala at a specific time,
these will reduce the congestion of taxis in the city centre and will also save time,” Kyofatogabye said.
He noted that as a ministry, they need to see how quickly they can avail affordable services to the people in
terms of transport. “We have decided to start with Entebbe because the majority of the people face a
challenge in accessing the airport and the East side of the city,” Kyofatogabye said adding that they opted to
start with Entebbe because it is one of the municipalities that has visionary leaders.
Robert Nyasimi, the chief executive officer of RentCo, said if the bus usage is well embraced, many Ugandans
are likely to get employed as drivers for the buses. The buses are blue in colour, have CCTV cameras, and will
have security personnel guarding the commuters and their belongings during their travels.

Abuja - On September 12, 2024, Uganda Airlines celebrated a significant milestone by launching direct flights
between Entebbe International Airport and Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja, Nigeria. The inaugural
flight was received by officials from both nations, including Dr. Hassan Ejibunu of Nigeria's Ministry of Aviation and
Aerospace Development and Uganda's State Minister for Transport, Hon. Fred Byamukama.
This new Entebbe-Abuja route, Uganda Airlines' second Nigerian destination after Lagos, aims to foster
economic, political, and social exchanges between Uganda and Nigeria. By providing direct air connectivity, the
route is expected to reduce travel time and costs, facilitating trade and investment. Uganda Airlines will operate
two weekly flights on this route—on Thursdays and Sundays—departing Entebbe at 16:00 and arriving in Abuja at
18:15, using the Airbus A330-800neo.
Speaking at the launch, Hon. Byamukama emphasized the strategic importance of enhancing air connectivity
across Africa and its role in advancing Uganda's efforts to implement the African Continental Free Trade Area
(AfCFTA). The new route will significantly boost trade, tourism, and cultural exchanges by connecting Uganda
with Abuja, a major economic and political hub in Nigeria.
Additionally, the 4th Nigeria-Uganda Trade & Business Forum was held in Abuja on September 13, 2024, bringing
together key stakeholders from both countries to explore opportunities for collaboration. The launch of flights to
Abuja marks Uganda Airlines' 14th destination and underscores Uganda's commitment to improving intra-
African travel and supporting the continent's growth through enhanced connectivity.

Park. This establishment is a product of a public-private partnership initiative spearheaded by Makerere
University.

Speaking to the media in Entebbe before take-off, High Commissioner of Uganda to Zambia, Amb. Col (rtd) Fred Mwesigye,
flanked by MoFA’s Head of Regional Economic Cooperation, Amb. Richard Kabonero, said that the new route not only
symbolizes the historical bonds of the three countries but also represents “a strategic move to enhance social and cultural
exchange leading to the boosting of business cooperation.”
In his remarks Hon. Kasaija, who led Uganda’s delegation on the inaugural flight, encouraged the spirit of “Africanisation”,
which should promote “oneness” among Africans with the aim of growing economies together.
He thanked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the relentless work involved to see this happen. “Air travel bridges distances
and is even more important in Africa, where alternative means of transport to connect the continent are lacking,” he said,
adding that it was his hope to see an improved balance of trade between the three countries. “It is my hope that improved
air connectivity between our countries will support a vibrant travel market that facilitates better business, trade and tourism
linkages between Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe”.
In Lusaka, Hon. Museba welcomed the commencement of flights from Entebbe as an important milestone in the Zambian
aviation industry further reaffirming that Zambia recognizes Uganda as a key strategic partner in promoting economic
development, trade and investment between the people of the two nations. “The commencement of flights will enhance the
already existing business linkages and create opportunities to promote tourism, trade and foreign direct investments in
Zambia and Uganda,” he said.
At the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport in Harare, High Commissioners Paul Amoru (Uganda) and Winpeg Moyo
(Zimbabwe) emphasized that the flight would strengthen people-to-people connections and support regional integration.
“As members of the East African Community and the Southern African Development Community, Uganda and Zimbabwe
are working towards enhanced connectivity that fosters economic growth and development,” said Amb. Moyo.
Uganda Airlines CEO, Jenifer Bamuturaki, expressed excitement about resuming flights to Zambia and Zimbabwe, countries
with close cultural and historical ties to Uganda. She highlighted the airline's commitment to expanding travel options
across East and Southern Africa by offering safe, affordable, and reliable air transport. The flights will cater to travelers
ending their journey in Uganda or connecting to destinations like Nairobi, Dar-es-Salaam, Dubai, Johannesburg, and more.
Uganda Airlines will operate the EBB-LUN-HRE route four times a week.

(UMU)’s Rubaga Campus. The launch of this 47-day exhibition took place on September 14 before a select cohort of
invitees who included the chief guest and Minister of Tourism, Wildlife & Antiquities, Hon. Col. (Rtd.) Tom Butime.
The exhibition is part of the theme: “God and Caesar: A Historical Exhibition Celebrating the 60th Anniversary of
the Uganda Martyrs’ Canonization,” which commemorates their canonization by the Catholic Church in 1964.
These relics hold deep religious and historical significance for Uganda, as they are not just physical remnants of
martyrdom but symbols of faith, sacrifice, and national identity. Additionally, the jawbone of Matia Mulumba and
relics of Charles Lwanga, classified as ‘First Class’ relics, are part of the collection, further enhancing the emotional
and spiritual impact of the exhibition.
The unveiling of these relics for the first time in over a century offers a unique opportunity for Ugandans and
international visitors to reflect on the profound legacy of the martyrs. The launch of the historic exhibition was
highlighted by a compelling panel discussion centered on the theme "God and Caesar" exploring the intersection
of faith and secular authority, reflecting on the Martyrs' legacy and its relevance in contemporary contexts.
In a panel discussion, the Chief Curator, Dr. David Tsimba, observed that the commemoration of the Martyrs led to
significant changes in the Catholic Church, including its democratization and a profound rational and spiritual
renewal. “Following June 3rd celebrations, women were finally permitted to join church choirs, and songs in local
languages, rather than just Latin, were introduced. Additionally, traditional instruments were subsequently allowed
in church services,” he revealed.
According to panelist Prof. Ssemakula Kiwanuka, the conflict between God and Caesar did not begin in Uganda. It
has been a global issue across generations. He noted that Pope Paul’s visit to Uganda was not solely due to its
designation as the "Pearl of Africa," but rather because of the significance of the Martyrs.
On his part, panelist Prof. Lwanga Luyingo from Makerere University observed that the Uganda Martyrs' story was
not coincidental, as our ancestors had a profound spirituality even before Christianity. “There were similarities
between traditional beliefs and Christian teachings, suggesting that these parallels may explain why Christianity
gained such traction,” he noted.
But according to Fr. Dr. Vienne, one of the panel discussants, the story of the Uganda Martyrs sheds a glorious light
on the history of Uganda and was a true martyrdom. The event was inaugurated by Hon. Tom Butime, who revealed
that the cabinet had decided to take charge of Namugogo as a facility of great national and international
significance.
At the launch, the VC Prof. Patrick Kyamanywa announced that the Uganda Martyrs University Nkozi will host the
grand canonization celebration on October 18, 2024, at the university’s Nkozi campus. He revealed a library
dedicated to the martyrs will be established at the campus to position the university as a central hub for scholarly
work on the martyrs. This ongoing exhibition promises to be a landmark in preserving Uganda's historical and
religious heritage. At the end of the exhibition, the relics (one pictured, right) will be returned to the Vatican in Rome.

The Karuziika Palace, nestled on Karuziika Hill overlooking Fort Portal Town on the picturesque Kabarole Hill in Fort
Portal, is more than just the official residence of the Omukama (king) of Tooro; it’s a living embodiment of the
Tooro Kingdom's rich cultural heritage.
The Royal Home was built in 1963 during the reign of Omukama Sir George Rukidi III, the 11th King of Tooro, upon the
restoration of Kingdoms. The first palace was called “Kakwamwemi”, meaning the one that ended the war.
Muammar Gaddafi, the former Libyan leader, contributed to the restoration and renovation of the palace. His
involvement came about in the early 2000s when he financially supported the refurbishment, helping to restore it
after years of neglect following the abolition of traditional monarchies by the Ugandan government in 1967.
The palace's history is a testament to the resilience of the Tooro Kingdom. After being destroyed in the 1960s,
Karuzika was fully restored in 2001, symbolizing the strength and revival of Tooro’s royal heritage. This resilience is
not just a historical fact; it's a living reality embodied in every stone of the palace.
w w w . m o f a . g o . u g 30
Karuziika Palace, the Heartbeat of
Tooro Kingdom's Legacy and Rich
Cultural Heritage.
Karuzika's stunning architecture
perfectly blends traditional and
modern styles. The palace offers a
breathtaking view of Fort Portal, and
on a clear day, you can catch a
glimpse of the famous Rwenzori
Mountains.
The palace is like a royal museum
where one will find relics from the
kingdom's rich history.
The walls are covered with pictures of
various kings, both the familiar and
unfamiliar, offering a deep dive into
the stories and traditions of the Tooro
people.
The palace is more than just a building; it's the heartbeat of the Tooro Kingdom's cultural life. From enthronement
ceremonies to royal gatherings, Karuzika Palace is where the most important Tooro cultural events take place. The
recently concluded EkyootoHaMpango24, marking 29 years since Omukama Rukirabasaija Oyo Nyimba Kabamba
Iguru Rukidi IV became King at the age of three, is just one example.
According to Tooro tradition, the king is supposed to stay in the palace alone, and when he marries, the wife is just
called upon as he wishes. Separate quarters are built outside for his servants, princes, and princesses.
In the Tooro culture, one enters the palace from an entrance called “Ilembo,” and “Mugaba nte “is the chief
entrance to the palace. “Omusanga is the royal pala or chief veranda where the King sits on cultural functions.
One of the most interesting things to see is the royal drum called “Kisurumbi”, which is stationed at the royal
palace from 6:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. When the king is around, it is sounded to inform his subjects of his presence.

A lady called “Omuranga” sits next to the “omusanga”; her role is to protect it, and she is the only one allowed to
touch it. Karunga Lillian is the third generation daughter from the Bahinda clan to become the Omusanga since it
is hereditary in nature.
The Karuzika Palace is not just a landmark; it's a living chapter of Tooro's royal legacy, quietly nestled in the hills
but brimming with stories. Next time you find yourself in Fort Portal City, don't just pass by-let the palace show you
what resilience looks like, where every stone has a story waiting to be told.

The Kasubi Tombs are open again after 14years, welcoming visitors to share in the rich history and cultural
treasures. Located in Kampala, the tombs sit on 30 hectares of hillside, serving as the final resting place for
Buganda’s Kings. The site is an architectural marvel, made from organic materials and celebrated for its
unique construction and intangible cultural values.
This sacred burial ground for Buganda's kings, had been closed after a devastating fire in 2010 that had
ravaged the main building, leaving the site in disrepair and halting tourism. UNESCO stepped in, declaring the
site endangered and providing aid for restoration.
After years of hard work, the Kasubi Tombs have been removed from the endangered list, thanks to the
reconstruction of the main funeral building, restoration of the guardian's house, and installation of a state-of-
the-art fire-fighting system.
With the reopening, the Buganda Kingdom and Ugandan government are eager to share this cultural gem
with the world, attracting tourists and generating income. The Kasubi Tombs are once again a place of
wonder, spirituality, and connection to the past.

National Theatre Hosts Filmmakers’ Symposium
Success Strategy Session
At the National Theatre, during the three-day film and culture market event themed "Upgrading the East African
Film Industry". Ugandan filmmakers gathered to explore ways to elevate filmmaking into a lucrative venture in
Uganda which aims to boost the local film sector's profitability.
European Union Ambassador to Uganda, H.E. Jan Sadek, highlighted the importance of Ugandan-made movies
and commended filmmakers like Nana Kagga and Louk Man Ali for their exceptional contributions to award-
winning film productions. Amb. Sadek articulated the need for the government's support in nurturing the
creative industry to provide employment opportunities for Ugandan youths.
Addressing the challenges faced by the Ugandan film industry, Margaret Kafeero, Head of Public Diplomacy at
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, emphasized the significance of producing films that reflect Ugandan culture and
interests. She encouraged filmmakers to collaborate and register as formal entities to gain government
support and enhance their credibility for sponsorships and partnerships.
"It must be a story about who we are, what we believe in, what our culture dictates, and what our problems are,"
filmmaker Mariam Ndagire stated in unison. We won't connect with a story about problems from another place,
nor will we come to see it, if it doesn't touch our souls.
The Kampala Film Foundation's Executive Director, Godfrey Musinguzi, addressed concerns including the
absence of distribution networks and filmmakers' dependence on foreign revenue streams in order to highlight
the necessity of developing a successful film industry in Uganda.

cases, the region now enjoys a refreshing change
thanks to the marathon.
Since its debut in 2022 with only 800 runners, the
Rwenzori Marathon has seen tremendous growth. This
year’s event highlights Uganda’s prowess in distance
running while featuring multi-day celebrations.
Organized by Amos Wekesa and his partners, an
East African tourism entrepreneur, the marathon
aims to replicate the success of the Kilimanjaro
Marathon, boosting local tourism and infrastructure.
Kasese residents have welcomed the influx of
visitors, benefiting from improved roads and
increased business for street vendors and bars.
According to locals, “The marathon is good
business,” reflecting its positive impact on the
community. This event represents a significant
advancement for both Kasese and Uganda,
enhancing its global reputation and economic
prospects.

half goals in a five-minute span, as Jinja
City Queens cruised to a comfortable
win of the 3rd edition of the Tokyo
International Conference on Africa
Development (TICAD) Cup 2024
Women’s Football tournament.
The two-day soccer tournament,
comprising Six girls’ football teams was
organised by Japan International
Cooperation Agency (JICA) Uganda in
partnership with Soltilo Bright Stars FC,
Federation of Uganda Football
Association (FUFA) and UNHCR at FUFA
Technical Centre, Njeru. It ended on
August 7th, 2024.

School from Entebbe, Jinja City Queens
which is also the official women team of
BUL, King of Kings, Agojo Star Girls and
Pagirinya young Ladies from Adjuman

saw Jinja City Queens defeat King of
Kings 2-0 after full time, to clinch the
Championship.
King of Kings started on a good note as
they displayed good techniques against
their opponents and dominated the first
20 minutes of play in the first half.
But the game changed after
Kilikumwino, while in the area, headed
straight in the back of the net after a
corner kick from the left wing by Teddy
Nyafwono, sending team mates into
jubilation. After a five-minutes span,
Kilikumwino headed inside her second
goal from a left corner kick by Nyafwono
in the closing moments of the first half.
Prior to scoring her brace, Kilikumwino
and Nyafwono directed shots towards
King of Kings goal keeper, Cecilia Kamuli,
who punched the balls over the bar
several times & managed to grip a few.
During the second half King of Kings SC’s
chances of scoring were too minimal as
Jinja City Queens did a lot of defending.
In the two Semifinal games that were
played in the morning, Jinja City Queens
beat Tagy High School 4-2 in penalties
after a 1-1 draw of full time as King of
Kings defeated Pagirinya Young Ladies
SC 1-0.
“I feel happy because we worked as a
team to score the two goals I did not get
any challenges while playing and we
challenged them mentally as they used a
lot of vigour during play,” Kilikumwino said.
Rashur Aliamba the head coach of Jinja
City Queens said he was excited after his
team winning the TICAD Cup 2024
championship adding that they
strategized properly and prepared for the
final game. Aliamba noted that teams
were really good but the determination of
his players helped them to achieve
whatever they wanted.
The coach of King of Kings, Rogers
Ayesiga, admitted losing to Jinja City
Queens 2-0 in head ball situations, two
corners and conceded two goals. “We are
now going back to the drawing board to
work on the set pieces and it did not go
well because the girls somehow forgot to
mark during set pieces because they had
several of them when they were heading
the ball when they were free. So that is a
homework for us the coaches to go back
to improve on that area,” Ayesiga
explained.
Hadija Balinabyo who emerged top scorer
in the tournament with 4 goals said the
tournament was so competitive in that all
teams exhibited their best during play but
for their side, they managed to take the
championship after following instructions
from their coaches.
The first edition of the TICAD Cup women
football tournament was won by King of
Kings in 2022, the second edition was won
by Kawempe Muslim SS in 2023 and Jinja
City Queens emerged winners for the 3rd
edition in this 2024 year.
The chairman of BUL FC Ronald Barente,
Inoue Yoichi, the Chief Representative of
JICA Uganda Office, John Chrysostom
Kalibala the Honorary Executive Member
at FUFA and also responsible for
development of women football at FUFA;
and Margaret Kubingi the Uganda Women
Football Association (UWFA) chairperson
handed over the championship trophy to
the Jinja City Queen team.
