On the diplomatic front, we have seen significant strides in

Geneva - The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hon. Gen. Odongo Jeje Abubaker recognised the support rendered by
the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) towards Uganda’s economic
development, and aimed at enhancing trade, investment, and sustainable development. This was during the
Global Leaders Forum, at the commemoration of UNCTAD’s 60th Anniversary, under the theme “charting a new
development course in a changing world,” which took place on June 13, 2024, where he represented H.E. Yoweri
Kaguta Museveni at the UN in Geneva.
Gen. Odongo revealed that the Summit of the Future is expected to demonstrate that international
cooperation can effectively tackle current challenges. Notably, the UN Secretary-General, Antonia Guterres
emphasised that the world cannot afford splits into rival blocs and called for a global economy to implement
the Sustainable Development Goals. On her part, the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan recognised
the digital economy as a powerful new engine of development, transforming trade into an intangible and
scalable activity while risking deeper divides and inequalities.
On the sidelines, Hon. Gen. Odongo held bilateral meetings with the Director-General (DG) of the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and Dr Ngozi Ikonjo-Iweala DG of the World Trade Organization (WTO)
at their respective headquarters in Geneva. Dr. Ngozi emphasised the importance of diversifying the economy
for a more effective African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), adding that the WTO supports Uganda in
implementing AfCFTA protocols and reducing trade barriers through the Trade Facilitation Agreement.
DG Tang thanked the Minister for Uganda’s role in the Traditional Knowledge Convention negotiations and
reported that since January 2022, WIPO added Uganda to project support, potentially expanding to
Geographical Indications. Hon. Odongo expressed gratitude for WIPO’s support to Uganda, “we thank you for
your support over the years, including project support to the establishment of 34 Technology and Innovation
Centres; building capacity for Patent Examiners and Drafters, development of a National Action Plan to protect
and benefit from Uganda’s traditional knowledge, genetic resources and traditional cultural expressions and
the development of the National Intellectual Property Policy in 2019,” said Odongo.

Seoul - Uganda and South Korea are poised to take
their relationship to the next level. This was evident
at the recently concluded Korea-Africa Summit in
Seoul, where Uganda's high-powered delegation,
led by Vice President Jessica Alupo, forged new
partnerships and secured increased economic
cooperation.
One of the most significant announcements was
Uganda's plan to open a resident embassy in South
Korea. A permanent diplomatic presence signifies a
commitment to maximizing the benefits of the
existing ten Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs)
between the two nations.
Furthermore, two new MoUs were signed during the
Summit, focusing on trade and investment
promotion, along with loan financing (increasing
South Korea's concessional loan to Uganda from
$34 million to $500 million for 2024-2028). These
agreements will create a more predictable and
stable environment for Korean investors venturing
into the Ugandan market.
During a bilateral discussion on June 2, 2024, in
Seoul, Hon. Oryem Henry Okello, Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs in-charge of International Affairs,
and Deputy Foreign Minister Hon. Chung Byung-
won of the Republic of Korea, delved into critical
issues such as climate change, food security,
supply chain stability, and health security.

Mission in Seoul, and Enhanced Economic Cooperation.

These topics which are essential for Africa's growth
aligned with the summit’s theme, "The Future We
Make Together: Shared Growth, Sustainability, and
Solidarity."
"We're excited about the prospect of a trade
agreement and a significant increase in Korean
loan commitments," stated Uganda’s Minister for
International Affairs. He revealed plans to propose
several infrastructure and energy projects for
Korean funding, potentially unlocking up to $500
million in concessional loans over the next five
years. This financial support could be instrumental
in propelling Uganda's development initiatives.
South Korea, on the other hand, sees Uganda as a
strategic partner in Africa. Deputy Foreign Minister
Byung-won emphasized Korea's commitment to
knowledge and technology sharing. Programs
focusing on capacity building, technology transfer,
and skill development will be at the forefront of their
collaborative efforts. This expertise exchange aims
to bolster Uganda's industrial growth and equip its
workforce with future-proof skills.
The Ugandan delegation actively participated in
various side events, delving into critical areas like
tourism development, agricultural advancement,
healthcare security, Information & Communication
Technologies, and infrastructure development. A
Business Summit at Lotte Hotel, Seoul, further
explored opportunities for industrialization, trade
promotion, and job creation.

Algiers - Minister of Foreign Affairs Hon. Gen Odongo
Jeje Abubaker called out the sluggish nature of the
Inter-Governmental Negotiation (IGN) for the UN
Security Council, observing convergences on a
number of clusters within major negotiating groups.
These remarks were made during his speech at the
11th Ministerial Meeting of the African Union
Committee of Ten (C10) on the reform of the United
Nations Security Council, which took place on June
10, 2024, in Algiers, Algeria.
Gen. Odongo observed that despite having some
convergences on a number of clusters within major
negotiating groups, there are simply many lacking
common grounds to move the process towards
fruitful intergovernmental negotiations.
The conference allowed C-10 Foreign Ministers to
discuss the status of IGNs at the UN General
Assembly, in order to devise strategies to advance
the Common African Position and determine the next
stages of the IGN process.

IEC Explores the Wonders of Queen Elizabeth National Park.
In a collaborative effort between the International Economic Cooperation department and the Uganda Tourism Board
(UTB), a delegation of 15 delegates embarked on a comprehensive exploration of Western Uganda, focusing on the
iconic Queen Elizabeth National Park among other attractions. Led by Connie Nuwagaba, a counselor in the
department, the expedition aimed to deepen understanding and promote the park's potential for international
tourism.
Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP), sprawling over 1,978 square kilometers, serves as a sanctuary for an
astonishing diversity of wildlife, i.e. 10 primates, 95 mammals, etc. The team's game drive provided close encounters
with lions, elephants, kobs, and a myriad of bird species (618), showcasing Uganda's rich ecological tapestry.
Beyond its natural beauty, the team observed ongoing challenges such as poaching and habitat degradation caused
by human activities. They noted the park's dedicated efforts in anti-poaching measures and habitat restoration
projects, crucial for preserving Uganda's natural heritage and supporting sustainable tourism.
Peace Nankinga, the
Personal Secretary in the
IEC Dpartnment, noted
that several staff have
never been to a single
national park in Uganda.

"The trip offered invaluable insights into Uganda's natural treasures," remarked
Connie Nuwagaba. "It reinforced the importance of showcasing these attractions
globally to attract tourism and investment that benefit both our economy and
conservation efforts." she added.
"Every ambassador and foreign representative ought to be taken around this country
to feel and witness the natural endowments that we have in terms of tourism among
several other investment opportunities which have to be marketed outside the
country," Ms. Nuwagaba emphasised.
"This initiative will not only enhance our understanding of several endowments but also equip us with knowledge of
several investment opportunities that can be sold to investors out of Uganda," urged Peace Nankinga, a delegate on
the trip. During discussions, the delegates emphasized the need for collaborative efforts to promote Uganda's tourism
potential. They highlighted plans to engage international partners in joint marketing campaigns and infrastructure
development aimed at enhancing visitor experiences.
The delegates appealed to the Uganda Tourism Board to continue providing branded material and other informative
merchandise to embassies and foreign missions, which can be used to attract tourists and investors. On his part,
Daniel Irunga, the 'Explore Uganda' brand manager, said the visit to Queen Elizabeth was a continuation of an earlier
initiative to have UTB and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs implement a joint international marketing strategy, support
crisis communications, and collaborate with diaspora associations to promote investment in Uganda.
Both entities remain committed to implementing this unified strategy aimed at positioning Uganda as a premier
tourism destination and conservation leader on the global stage.

The Ugandan diaspora community has emerged as a crucial contributor to the country's economic
development, with remittances surpassing traditional foreign direct investment and official development
assistance.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, remittances from the diaspora reached $1.42 billion (UGX 5.5 trillion)
in the last 12 months, a 13.4% increase from the previous year. This significant influx of foreign currency has
helped stabilize the economy, invest in real estate, and support household expenditures.
Beyond remittances, the diaspora community has invested in businesses,
created jobs, and transferred skills and knowledge to Uganda. Amb. Johnny
Muhindo, Head of the Diaspora Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
emphasized the diaspora's role during the Joint Retreat of Uganda Missions
from the Ring States.
He highlighted the need for a comprehensive national diaspora policy to fully
harness their contributions and address the challenges they face. "We need a
comprehensive national diaspora policy to fully harness their contributions
and address the challenges they face," Amb. Muhindo said.
Despite their significant contributions, Ugandans living abroad encounter
numerous challenges, including legal and immigration issues, employment
and economic instability, access to healthcare, mental anguish, and
difficulties in transferring funds to their home country.
Ambassador Muhindo stressed the importance of addressing these challenges and creating an enabling
environment for the diaspora to invest and contribute to Uganda's development. "The diaspora community is
eager to contribute to Uganda's development, and we believe that with the right policies and support, they can
make a very significant impact," he explained. "We urge the government to prioritize the diaspora policy and
create an enabling environment for them to invest and contribute to Uganda."
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Diaspora Department has outlined tasks to enhance diaspora engagement,
including completing the Regulatory Impact Assessment, launching the National Diaspora Policy, promoting
diaspora agri-preneurs, and creating a diaspora bond. The department also plans to collaborate with
international organizations to bridge the financing gap in implementing its mandate.
"Countries that have recognized the value of their diaspora population to development efforts have instituted
policies, legal and institutional frameworks that harness diaspora contributions," said Ambassador Muhindo.
"We must do the same to reap the benefits of our diaspora community."
The retreat, attended by diplomats, government officials, and diaspora representatives, called for a concerted
effort to support the diaspora community and promote Uganda's development. Participants agreed on the
need for a coordinated approach to engage the diaspora community and harness their contributions to
Uganda's growth.

Uganda Embassy Brussels Enhances Diaspora Engagement
with Monthly Consular Outreach Programs in the Netherlands
Amsterdam - In a commendable move to strengthen the bond with its citizens abroad and enhance national
development, the Embassy of Uganda in Brussels has initiated a series of monthly consular outreach programs
in the Netherlands. These sessions, designed to cater to the needs of Ugandan nationals living in the diaspora,
have proven to be a valuable bridge between Ugandans abroad and their homeland.
The monthly consular outreach sessions have become a vital lifeline for many Ugandan citizens residing in the
Netherlands as they provide a platform where Ugandans can access essential consular services such as
registering national IDs, processing of passport renewals, and legalising documents. This initiative has been met
with immense appreciation from the Ugandan community, who previously faced challenges in accessing these
services from afar.
One of the cornerstone achievements of these consular programs is the registration of national IDs. This crucial
service enables Ugandans in the diaspora to partake more actively in the nation’s progression.
By securing their national IDs, diaspora members can engage in various civic responsibilities and benefit from
government programs. This inclusion fosters a deeper connection with Uganda and encourages contributions
towards national growth. Moreover, facilitating passport renewals and document legalizations ensures that
Ugandans abroad remain compliant with international regulations, thereby simplifying their travel and
professional endeavours. These services are indispensable for maintaining smooth logistical connections
between Uganda and its global diaspora.
The consular outreach programs also offer a host of other services, as required, tailored to meet the unique
needs of individual participants. By legalizing documents, the embassy helps Ugandans manage their legal
affairs more effectively in a foreign country, whether for education, business, or personal reasons.
These monthly sessions are a testament to the proactive stance of the Ugandan Embassy in Brussels. They
showcase their dedication to fostering strong relationships with Ugandans abroad. They underscore the
importance of a responsive and accessible foreign service in promoting national development and unity.
With proper documentation and support, diaspora members can contribute more effectively to Uganda's
economic growth through remittances, investments, and sharing of skills and knowledge. Additionally, these
outreach programs help collect data, enabling the government to better understand and support its citizens
abroad. This, in turn, can inform more targeted and effective policies that benefit both the diaspora & the nation.
The Embassy of Uganda in Brussels, through its monthly consular outreach programs in the Netherlands, has
taken a significant step in enhancing the lives of Ugandans abroad. This initiative provides essential services and
underscores the country's commitment to integrating its global citizens into the national fold. Uganda is paving
the way for a more inclusive and prosperous future by empowering the diaspora.

Uganda Airlines to Commence
Direct Flights to London, U.K.
London - Uganda is set to launch direct flights between
Entebbe & London, a significant milestone announced by
the Uganda Mission in London on June 19, 2024. The
groundbreaking event featured a team from Uganda
Airlines engaging with UK aviation authorities, the
business community, and the Ugandan diaspora in
preparation for the direct flights.
Uganda Airlines secured slots for departures and landings
at London Heathrow Airport after receiving its two Airbus
A330-800 Neo aircraft in December 2020 and February
2021. Despite this, no trips had been made to the UK due to
delays caused by the need for updated certification from
the UK Civil Aviation Authority and the European Aviation
Safety Agency.
Aviation Development Chief Analyst, James Pearson,
highlighted the potential market, noting that over 84,000
passengers flew on the Entebbe-London route in 2019,
making Entebbe the second-largest unserved market
from Africa to London.
The introduction of the London route is expected to further
enhance Uganda’s connectivity and boost economic ties
with Europe. Ms. Bamuturaki emphasized the strategic
importance of these flights in strengthening Uganda's
position as a key player in regional and international
aviation. "The direct flights to London mark a new chapter
in Uganda Airlines' growth and our commitment to
connecting Uganda to the world," she stated.
Both the MoFA and Uganda Airlines are optimistic that the
new route will significantly impact tourism, business
travel, and the diaspora community, providing a seamless
travel experience and fostering greater economic
cooperation between Uganda and the UK.

Uganda Coffee Blooms at Coffex Exhibition in Istanbul, Turkey.
Istanbul - Uganda Embassy Ankara, under the Economic and
Commercial Diplomacy (ECD) initiative, joined the rest of the world in
promoting Uganda Coffee at the Coffex International coffee exhibition
in Istanbul, the capital the connects Asia and Europe.
Uganda was chosen as the focus country for the 2024 coffex edition due to the consistency of the Embassy in
promoting Uganda Coffee in Turkey and participating in coffex since 2020.
Statistics show that Turkey has a population of 86 million and a GDP of 1.14 trillion USD creating significant market
for Ugandan exports, particularly coffee. Istanbul, the country's commercial center, was the most visited city in the
world in 2023, followed by London, the United Kingdom, Dubai, UAE and Antalya. Turkey's GDP per capita is $44,900,
making it a vital destination for Ugandan businesses.
Records show that Uganda coffee exports to Turkey have been improving exponentially with 2,260 bags in 2019 to
44,019 bags in 2023. This exponential jump in coffee exports is attributed to the efforts of Uganda Embassy in
Ankara and the unending support from UCDA in partnership with the Embassy & MoFA in promoting Uganda
coffee abroad.

The experience of traveling abroad begins with ensuring you have adequate travel
documentation. Obtaining a visa can be a challenging task, but once you have it,
you are almost 90 percent certain of your trip. The Embassy of the People’s
Republic of China facilitated my visa within 48 hours.
The purpose of my 14-day stay in China (20th June to 3rd July) was to attend a
Seminar on International Development Cooperation for Uganda. The fully-funded
trip was sponsored by the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China
and organized by the Hunan International Business Vocational College in
Changsha Province.
My eagerness to understand China’s national conditions, particularly their
experiences in poverty reduction and alleviation, was greatly rewarded. The
program was rich in content, covering various aspects. We learned about the
development of China's economy, society, and politics since the founding of the
People’s Republic of China, as well as its reform and opening-up. The
transformation was astounding, showing how far the nation has come.
My China Experience: A Journey of Learning and Discovery
We discussed effective measures and useful experiences on eliminating absolute poverty. Hearing firsthand accounts of success
stories from remote villages was incredibly inspiring. The session on China’s Modernization and Sino-African Common
Development explored the impact of China’s modernization on cooperation and development between China and Africa. The
parallels and potential for shared growth were eye-opening. The importance and impact of actively engaging in international
development assistance to expand international cooperation were highlighted using iconic case studies.
We explored the importance, implementation methods, achievements, and challenges of friendly cooperation between cities.
The stories of city partnerships fostering economic and cultural exchange were particularly memorable. The achievements and
future development aspirations of the Belt and Road Initiative were discussed, stressing the ambitious and inspiring vision for
global connectivity and cooperation.
We received lectures from highly acclaimed experts, including Wu Chuanhua, Secretary-General of the China-Africa Institute, Liu
Qi Feng, Deputy Director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist
Party of China, Li Peng, Deputy Director of the Hunan Provincial Department of Commerce, Jiang Yanhui, Professor and Doctoral
Supervisor at the Department of Accounting, School of Business Administration, Hunan University, and Xie Yuhua, Professor and
Doctoral Supervisor at the Department of Business Administration, School of Business Administration, Hunan University.
During the seminar, we visited the China-Africa Economic and Trade Cooperation Promotion Innovation Demonstration Park,
Yuan Longping High-Tech Agriculture Co., Ltd., and Chengdu City, where we experienced the lifetime opportunity of seeing the
pandas. The sheer number of tourists got me thinking about what Uganda can do to draw similar attention to the mountain
gorillas that are unique to our nation. One of the most striking observations was the prevalence of electric vehicles (EVs) from
various brands. It was clear that green energy is the future, and China is at the forefront of this transformation.
We also had the chance to visit the historic Yuelu Academy. Established in 976 AD during the Song dynasty, the academy has
long been a bastion of Chinese culture and values. Learning that Chairman Mao was an alumnus added a profound sense of
connection to China’s revolutionary past and its commitment to education. Another highlight was our visit to Du Fu's Thatched
Cottage in Chengdu. This serene spot, dating back to the Tang dynasty in the 7th century, was captivating. The preservation of
such historical sites underscores the importance of history to the Chinese people and how it shapes their future.
The kindness and hospitality of the Chinese people left a lasting impression on me. From sharing meals with locals to navigating
bustling markets with friendly vendors, the warmth of the people was palpable. The variety of food was amazing, from exotic
local dishes like Peking duck and hotpot to international cuisine. Each meal was an adventure, offering a taste of China’s rich
culinary heritage. Shopping was another delightful experience, with options ranging from world-renowned brands to more
affordable outlet stores. Walking through glitzy malls and bustling street markets, I marveled at the endless array of goods
available. The infrastructure in China is nothing short of spectacular, featuring efficient domestic flights, high-speed railways,
and well-maintained metro stations. Traveling from city to city was seamless and comfortable.
Our course coordinators worked tirelessly to ensure that all participants were well taken care of. They made sure to even arrange
special meals for those with dietary restrictions. This dedication was evident during the emotional sending-off ceremony and
last-day goodbyes, which testified to the bond built over the two weeks.
My China experience was not just about learning but also about building friendships and understanding a culture rich in history
and modern achievements. Every moment was filled with discovery. The most vital lesson I took away from this journey was the
timeless wisdom of Confucian ideologies: the importance of education, respect for others, and the pursuit of harmony in society.
These principles were evident in every aspect of Chinese life and the country's remarkable progress. China, now the second-
largest economy in the world, is undoubtedly destined for the very top. My journey left me with valuable insights, lasting
memories, and a deep appreciation for a nation that harmoniously blends its ancient traditions with modern advancements.

In Uganda, there's ample enthusiasm for cheering international athletes
in global competitions, but a noticeable gap emerges when it comes to
celebrating our own talent. While financial support is imperative,
embracing our local athletes and bestowing the recognition they deserve
is vital.
In the bustling streets of Kampala, there walks a champion whose
presence often goes unnoticed. Catherine Nanziri, a professional boxer
and former Olympian, carries the pride of Uganda, yet her achievements
seem to fade into the background of everyday life.
Nanziri, the current belt holder of the African Boxing Union’s women's
bantamweight division and the first female boxer to represent
Uganda at the 2020 Japan Olympics, is currently ranked #23 in the
world and #2 in Africa.
Ugandan athletes have a rich history of triumphs, from John Mugabi's
legendary fight against Marvin Hagler to numerous global athletes
who seek recognition abroad due to lack of community support.
Nanziri's story underscores the urgent need for investment in Uganda's
sporting infrastructure and grassroots programs. Let's champion our athletes,
nurture their talents, and celebrate their triumphs. The time for action is now.
