Diplomacy and Treaty Governance by Indonesia as Norm -shaping Practices to Align
National Interests of Indonesia
Abdurrahman Al-Fatih Ifdal

Treaty governance in Indonesia is central to both the promotion of rule of law through diplomacy
and the advancement of predictability in international relations, particularly those reflected through
foreign policy conducted by Indonesia. By integrating domestic treaty governance with international
legal standards, Indonesia enhances global legal stability and certainty. This approach highlights
Indonesia’s commitment to maintaining legal principles, reinforcing its role as a key player in global
diplomacy and international governance. This article hopes to thoroughly research the practices
considered norm-shaping as seen through Indonesia’s diplomacy and treaty governance laws, with
a particular focus on the Minister of Foreign Affairs Regulation No. 4 of 2023 on the Governance of
International Treaty Documents and other related regulations. In addition , this article seeks to
identify the key norms regulating treaty governance in I ndonesia as further established through
Indonesia’s engagements in the international community. This article argues that treaty governance
should not be seen merely as a monitoring mechanism but also as a tool for shaping norms. With
treaty governance as a tool for shaping norms related to Indonesia’s foreign policies that are based
on treaties implementation, Indonesia will then be able to promote predictability in aligning its
national interests within the implementation dynamics of treaties themselves. This article then
proposes a takeaway for Indonesia in which Indonesia’s treaty governance is able to ensure that
all treaties undergo a thorough legal review to ensure alignment with domestic laws and
constitutional principles. By providing such a mechanism, this article argues that Indonesian must
identify its national laws in order to explicitly locate the tr eaty governance norms, in which
Indonesia’s diplomacy must refer to. This strategic approach o f utilizing treaty governance as a
means to align Indonesia’s domestic laws allows Indon esia to promote consistency and legal
certainty globally while aligning international norms with its domestic priorities.

Keywords: treaty governance, diplomacy, norm-shaping, Indonesia, national interest.

Measuring the Competitiveness and Efficiency of Indonesian Non-Oil and Gas Exports to
Non-Traditional Markets
Hotsawadi, Imelda Veronica Gea

In order to improve the performance of the trade balance, Indonesi a is currently always trying to
diversify the market through the expansion of export markets to non-traditional countries. For this
reason, measuring competitiveness and export efficiency is c rucial to be researched first. This
study aims to measure the competitiveness and efficiency of Indonesia's Non-Oil and Gas Exports
to Non-Traditional Markets period 2016 to 2021 by using the  analysis methods RCA, EPD, X -
Model and Stochastic Frontier Analysis with Gravity Mo del (SFGM). The results of the anal ysis
show that based on the results of the competitiveness analysis (RCA) and export performance
using EPD and X-Model, it shows that the competitiveness of Indonesia's non-oil and gas exports
to non-traditional countries is still low or below global competitiveness. Meanwhile, the results of
estimation using the Stochastic Frontier Analysis approach with the Gravity Model (SFGM) show
that the variables of GDP of non-traditional countries, the number of population of non-traditional
countries, Indonesia's GDP, competitiveness (RCA) and the area of non-traditional countries have
a positive and significant effect on Indonesia's exports. Meanwhile, economic distance is estimated
to have a negative and significant influence on Indonesia's non-oil and gas exports.

Trade Potential in the Bilateral Relationship Between Indonesia-South Korea (Perspective:
SITC Agregat 1 Digit) 2013-2022
Uci Yusri Nurhidayah

The Republic of Indonesia and South Korea have engaged in a bilateral cooperation spanning 50
years across diverse domains. Despite the success of this collaboration in augmenting the overall
trade between the two nations in alignment with their initial economic objectives, the trajectory of
trade development has not consistently followed a linear pattern. This study aims to elucidate the
trading dynamics between Indonesia and South Korea from 201 3 to 2022. This period was
selected as it reflects significant dynamics in b ilateral trade relations as well as global economic
fluctuations that influenced the trade patterns of both countries. T his is achieved through a
comprehensive analysis utilizing methodologies such as the Grubel -Lloyd Index, Trade Balance
Index (TBI), Trad e Complementarity Index (TCI), and Revealed Symmetric Comparative
Advantage Index (RSCA). The research outcomes reveal a hi gh degree of industrial
interrelatedness within 10 commodity groups, with 7 exhibiting robust integration and 3 displaying
varying degrees of integration ranging from moderate to weak. Despite the sustained high level of
compatibility in the trade structure, discernible fluctuations are observed in trade surpluses and
deficits. The analysis of the Revealed Symmetric Comparative Advantage Index highlights the
absence of significant comparative advantages for Indonesia across the majority of the analyzed
commodities. Notwithstanding marginal alterations in the Product Mapping classification, statistical
analyses of (IIT), TBI, TCI, and RSCA underscore bilateral trade's nuanced and dynamic nature,
with annual fluctuations necessitating focused attention.

INTRODUCTION
Overview of Diplomacy and Treaty
Governance in Indonesia
Treaty governance is a critical aspect of
international diplomacy, functioning as the
framework through which states manage and
uphold their commitments to one another on
a wide range of global issues, such as trade,
security, and environmental protection. By
formalizing agreements into binding treaties,

Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.76


140
countries create a legal structure that
promotes cooperation and reduces
uncertainty in international relations.
Effective treaty governance not only requires
successful negotiation and ratification of
treaties but also ensures their proper
implementation, monitoring, and, when
necessary, adaptation to changing global
circumstances. International treaties, much
like national laws, bind states to specific
obligations, reducing uncertainty in state
behavior (Webster & Cheyne, 2017).
In the context of diplomacy, a treaty
is often seen as an output, particularly its
central role in global governance (Hoffman,
et al .). Here, diplomacy serves as the
process through which countries engage in
dialogue, negotiations, and compromises to
resolve disputes or align their interests, and
the treaty becomes the product of these
diplomatic efforts, although miscoordination
among diplomatic efforts may result to what
Jinnah (2007) refers to as ‘treaty overlap’.
Therefore, there needs to be a management
effort, often governed by a secretariat
responsible to oversee such treaties, to
decrease duplication, increase synergy, and
address conflicting rules among regimes
(Jinnah, 2007).
However, once negotiations are
concluded and treaties are signed, the real
challenge arises in terms of the governance
of treaties themselves. A common issue that
arises is when international treaties fail to
produce their intended effects (Hoffman, et
al., 2022) How should a state monitor and
evaluate its treaty? How does a particular
action by one state in governing its treaties
affect its relations with its counterparts in
such treaties? How do norms play a role in
mitigating any possible diplomatic risks?
As will be explained further in this
research, a treaty plays a pivotal role in
diplomatic relations. It may bind states
legally or only politically, and whatever
happens afterwards determines predictability
in the relations of such states. Speaking
about governance of treaties means
regulating the institutional provisions of
treaties. It may include treaty secretariats, as
seen for instance in global environmental
treaties (Bauer, Busch, and Siebenhüner,
2009).
One of the core functions of treaty
governance is its capacity to establish a
reliable and consistent legal framework.
International treaties, akin to domestic laws,
impose specific obligations on states,
thereby minimizing unpredictability in their
actions. In Indonesia, treaties are considered
as an output for international cooperation
and foreign relations (Republic of Indonesia.
Law No. 24 of 2000 on International Treaties,
2000). Hence, one of the fundamental ideas

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.76


141

underpinning Indonesia's treaty governance
is the importance of protecting national
sovereignty. Article 4 of its Law No. 24 of
2000 on International Treaties emphasizes
that the government of Indonesia must
consider national interests in the negotiation
and ratification of international treaties. Apart
from it, the government must adhere to the
principles of equality, mutual benefit, and
consideration of both national and applicable
international laws (Republic of Indonesia.
Law No. 24 of 2000 on International Treaties,
2000).
There are several aspects to note in
the norms regulated in Law No. 24 of 2000
which become the foundational directions for
Indonesia’s treaty governance going
forward. The law stresses the importance of
legal certainty and the obligation to act in
good fa ith when entering into international
agreements. Article 4(1) outlines that treaties
must be based on mutual consent, and
parties are bound to implement them
faithfully. This philosophical stance aligns
with the broader principle of pacta sunt
servanda (agreements must be kept), a
cornerstone of international treaty law, which
reinforces that treaties are legally binding
instruments that create predictable and
stable legal relations between states.
This principle reflects on the
dimension of current global politics.
Dynamics of global politics make treaty -
making increasingly more difficult, especially
in a highly pluralist society (Kälin, 2000). If
overall treaty-making steps are affected by
such global politics, treaty governance itself
will be affected. This article  argues that
national interests may, partially or
comprehensively, affect how treaties are
applied, interpreted, and/or observed by a
country. Indonesia’s treaty governance is
built on the idea that international treaties
should promote cooperation and be mutually
beneficial. However, it should be noted that
national interests are central in treaty -
making. In the context of treaty governance,
national interests influence the extent to
which a state commits to international
obligations, ensuring that any agreement
aligns with the country’s broader strategic
goals.
National Interests through Treaty
Governance
Minister of Foreign Affairs Regulation No. 4
of 2023 on the Governance of International
Treaty Documents (“FM Reg No. 4 of 2023”)
was enacted on February 21st, 2023. The
regulation came into force on the date it was
promulgated, that is March 3rd, 2023. With
almost 23 years apart, both Law No. 24 of
2000 on International Treaties and FM Reg
No. 4 of 2023 provide a  framework of guiding
principles and procedural details that
regulate how international treaties are

Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.76


142
created, ratified, and managed. Both are
designed to ensure that treaty governance is
closely aligned with Indonesia’s national
interests. By integrating treaty -making
processes with national objectives such as
sovereignty, economic development,
security, and environmental sustainability,
these legal instruments allow Indonesia to
participate in the international legal system
while prioritizing its domestic goals.
The regulation emphasizes that
Indonesia's engagement in international
treaties must be consistent with its
sovereignty and national priorities. This
aligns with Indonesia’s long -standing
philosophy of maintaining strong national
autonomy in its international relations. By
establishing systematic governance for
treaty documents, the regulation ensures
that Indonesia’s treaty obligations respect its
sovereignty and safeguard its national
interests. Observing from other state
practices in terms of practicing their
international legal personality through
foreign affairs conducts, Australia may be a
prominent example.
Australia enacts its Foreign Relations
(State and Territory Arrangement) Act of
2020 or the Foreign Relations Act. In
analyzing the consequences of this act for
international law, Clough argues that
diplomacy is fundamental to the law of
cooperation as it ensures order and stability
in international relations (Clough, 2023).
Australia’s Foreign Relations (State and
Territory Arrangements) Act 2020 regulates
the Commonwealth's ability to manage and
protect Australia's foreign relations at various
governmental levels, aligning external
agreements with national foreign policy
priorities (Australia, Foreign Relations Act ,
2020). The central argument of the Act is that
State and Territory entities —which include
governments, universities, and local
councils—must not independently engage in
foreign agreements without the oversight of
the Commonwealth. This Act is a
resemblance of national interests in play
through treaty governance laws.
Australia's case also shows that a
treaty governance may also set forth
provisions on subsidiary arrangements. In
addition to direct foreign agreements, the Act
also covers subsidiary arrangements —
agreements that are indirectly connected to
a core foreign arrangement. For example, if
a local government signs a deal under the
broader framework of a national
government-to-government treaty, this
subsidiary arrangement is also subject to
scrutiny. The idea here is to prevent any
loopholes where minor or second ary
agreements could undermine the intent of
the overarching national agreement
(Australia, Foreign Relations Act, 2020).

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.76


143

This Act also shows that all foreign
agreements at the State and Territory level
must be consistent with Australia’s foreign
policy. The Act gives a broad definition of
foreign policy, which can include both formal,
publicly available policies as well as internal,
non-published positions. This wide scope
allows the Minister flexibility in assessing
whether an arrangement is consistent with
Australia’s broader strategic interests. As
noted from Firth, foreign policy is what
governments do in the internationa l arena
(Firth, 2020). Hence, the Foreign Relations
Act is important for maintaining national
coherence on economic diplomacy. It
prevents state governments or institutions,
such as universities, from engaging in
foreign economic deals that may undermine
federal trade agreements or affect Australia’s
overall economic strategy.
This relates to how governance
networks shape international law. It allows
norms development on several global issues
from the bottom up. From here, it can be
inferred that since treaties are negotiated
and signed by the national government, any
sub-national arrangement that conflicts with
an existing treaty could undermine a
country’s international commitments. This
article hopes to clarify Indonesia's context in
which treaty governance sets forth rules
governing norm-shaping practices in relation
to diplo macy and how it aligns, and
consistently aligns, with Indonesia’s national
interests.

RESEARCH METHOD
This article studies Indonesia’s treaty
governance and will center on a case study
approach, supplemented by analyses from
Indonesia’s national laws governing treaties
and treaties governance. Further, this article
centers on arguments relating to the
connection between diplomacy and treaty
governance.
Practices considered norm -shaping
in treaty governance of Indonesia will be
examined, as it will present a detailed
illustration of how treaty obligations are
navigated and implemented across different
contexts. This article will not examine
overarching ca ses of varying diplomacy
efforts of Indonesia, as it focuses only the
normative nature of treaty governance in
Indonesia. In particular, this article analyzes
treaty governance in Indonesia in the context
of understanding diplomacy as a
fundamental aspect of treaty governance,
facilitating negotiation, im plementation, and
compliance among states.
To gain a full understanding of this
article’s research objective, this article seeks
to clarify Indonesia’s stance in its treaty

Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)

governance and how it utilizes treaty
governance through its diplomacy and
negotiations to develop the terms of treaties,
ensuring that the interests and concerns of
all parties are adequately represented. In
addition, this article highlights how treaties
are governed in Indonesia and how it
connects with diplomacy afterwards, as it is
often understood that treaty monitoring
schemes are seen as an evaluation method
instead as a norm -shaping practice in
aligning national interests with Indonesia’s
recent diplomacy.
In terms of monitoring treaties,
ideational theories show, as pointed out by
Simmons (2010), that there is a link between
domestic governance to better international
law compliance. This article observes that
treaty governance involves efforts made
after t reaties are concluded as well. For
instance, Sampaio (2022), through her
Antarctic Treaty governance article,
emphasized the role of diplomatic practices,
such as the gradual introduction of issues,
avoidance of contentious topics, and the use
of ambiguous  language to facilitate
consensus among treaty parties. Sampaio
also argued that such practices have
enabled the Antarctic Treaty to adapt and
maintain legitimacy while circumventing
potential conflicts over sovereignty
(Sampaio, 2022). This occurs after the
Antarctic Treaty is concluded, which shows
the effective implementation of treaty
governance to enforce the agreed norms
inside the Antarctic Treaty. In addition, such
effective implementation must also consider
the limits of the law to settle any possi ble
tensions surrounding the implementation.
Hobbs & Young (2021) argue that, in the
context of seeing treaties as mechanisms to
settle tensions, relational characteristics
must be embedded in modern treaty making
rules in order to meet the parties’ aspirations.
This article hopes to explain how
Indonesia may advance and maximize its
treaty governance laws to build a successful
treaty governance which relies on
cooperative diplomatic practices, such as
consensus-building and strategic ambiguity,
which have enabled  a treaty to adapt over
time, ensuring predictability and alignment in
Indonesia’s national interests. This article is
divided into two main subsections in its
discussion part.
First, this article analyzes the norm -
shaping practices as regulated under treaty
governance laws of Indonesia. It examines
how these practices shape norms which
relate to treaty governance, and how treaty
governance sets forth rules regulating such
dynamics. It will show the vital role of
diplomacy in fostering effective governance
frameworks within complex geopolitical
context, and how this challenge arises from

Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.76


145

a poorly managed treaty governance. For
instance, this article explores how certain
provisions of a treaty may affect how it is
governed, thus implying possible varying
political, scientific, and economic interests of
the signatory states.
This idea will be further elaborated by
examining provisions of FM Reg No. 4 of
2023 and how it may affect future
implementation of treaties and their
governance. This article further analyzes
how this regulation can facilitate coordination
between different governmental sectors to
ensure a unified approach to foreign affairs,
especially those related to treaty
governance.
 Second, this article examines the
national interests of Indonesia and how they
are portrayed in treaty governance
mechanisms. The primary goal of FM Reg
No. 4 of 2023 is to enhance the effectiveness
and coherence of Indonesia's foreign affairs
strategies. By providing a clear set of
guidelines, the regulation ensures that all
diplomatic initiatives align with national
interests and are executed efficiently across
various sectors. It also establishes
guidelines for how treaties are negotiated,
signed, and ra tified within Indonesia. This
includes the roles of different government
bodies and the necessary procedures for
ensuring compliance with international
obligations. Thus, the second idea of this
article follows national interests of Indonesia
as further translated into norm -shaping
practices through treaty governance laws.

RESULT AND DISCUSSION

Norm-Shaping Practices in Treaty
Governance of Indonesia
Treaty governance in Indonesia discusses
the process and approach conducted by
Indonesia on international agreements,
establishing clear protocols for the
negotiation, signing, ratification, and
implementation of treaties. Both Law No. 24
of 2000 on International Treaties and FM
Reg No. 4 of 2023 provide a way to
understand treaty governance in Indonesia,
alongside other related laws as may be
considered relevant. Lantis argues that, for a
treaty ratification to be successful, there are
certain factors to c onsider. These include
factors like executive strategies, regime type,
interest group pressure, and public opinion
influence the success or failure of treaty
ratifications (Lantis, 2006).
The simple illustration of treaty
governance in Indonesia can be observed
from the status of a treaty: does it require the
parties (Indonesia and the counterpart(s)) to
monitor and evaluate the implementation of
that treaty? Although this may be a solution
in and on itself, the case of treaty governance

is not as simple as putting a
monitoring/evaluation clause in a treaty. A
comprehensive and on -target treaty
governance requires more than just
normative corridors.
This article invites its readers to learn
from ASEAN the governance and  evaluation
of the ASEAN legal framework for
addressing transboundary haze pollution as
a case study. Here, ASEAN maximizes its
‘ASEAN Way’ method (a consensus-building
approach) with its declarations and
resolutions in order to harmonize
environmental policies which then result in
monitoring and reporting mechanisms
towards the ASEAN legal framework for
addressing transboundary haze pollution
(Nurhidayah, Lipman & Alam, 2014). For
Indonesia, the obstacles at the time were
unreadiness and lack of coordination among
Indonesian government institutions in
implementing the ASEAN Agreement on
Transboundary Haze Pollution. From here,
this article concludes that treaty governance
cannot rely on ly on regulatory norms
specifically dealing with treaty governance.
These norms must be complemented with
robust coordination schemes, participation of
all relevant institutions, as well as roadmap
on treaty governance that is tailor -made to
each respective sector-specific treaty.
It goes without saying that, since a
treaty is negotiated by national governments,
certain considerations are in place. Poulsen
and Aisbett provided an example of this
aspect in an economic diplomacy setting.
They argue that strategic foreign policy
considerations have affected several
investment treaty negotiations (Poulsen &
Aisbett, 2016). It also shows that diplomats
play a crucial role in shaping the international
investment regime, driven among others by
national interests.
Norm-shaping practices of Indonesia
in terms of treaty governance include
regulations on necessary robustness and
protections for Indonesia in entering into
certain treaties. Guidelines, for example
Presidential Regulation No. 71 of 2020 on
the Procedures for Ratification of
International Trade Treaties, create clear
directions for the ratification process of
international trade treaties to ensure
compliance with national laws and interests.
This regulation applies to all international
trade treaties that Indonesia intends to enter
into, which may impact national policies,
economic conditions, or the legal framework
(Republic of Indonesia, Presidential
Regulation No. 71 of 2020 on the Procedures
for Ratification of International Trade
Treaties, 2020).

Presidential Regulation No. 71 of
2020 serves as a critical framework for the
ratification of international trade treaties in
Indonesia, establishing clear procedures that
guide the country in navigating its
commitments to international trade while
ensuring alignment with national interests.
As Indonesia increasingly engages in global
trade dynamics, this regulation is paramount
in ensuring that the process of entering into
international agreements is both sys tematic
and reflective of the democratic principles
underpinning the nation’s governance.
The regulation specifies its
application to all international trade treaties
that Indonesia seeks to enter, covering a
wide range of trade -related commitments.
This includes bilateral and multilateral
agreements, investment treaties, and related
arrangements that could affect Indonesia's
economic landscape and policy directions.
By delineating the scope, the regulation
ensures that all pertinent agreements
undergo the same rigorous ratification
process, promoting consistency and
transparency.
In its Article 2, the regulation provides
robust foundational procedures on the actors
and documents necessary to ratify
international trade treaties. The primary
focus of Presidential Regulation No. 71 of
2020 is to provide a structured methodology
for the ratification of international trade
agreements. By doing so, the regulation
facilitates Indonesia's participation in global
trade while ensuring that national interests
are adequately protected. The regulation
acknowledges the significance of
international agreements in promoting
economic growth and enhancing
competitiveness but emphasizes the need
for thorough scrutiny before entering binding
commitments.
In terms of treaty governance, the
regulation adds layers which were previously
primarily regulated under Law No. 24 of 2000
and FM Reg No. 4 of 2023. The consultation
process mandated by Article 3(2) of
Presidential Regulation No. 71 of 2020
allows for the inclusion of diverse
perspectives from various stakeholders,
including civil society, the private sector, and
other relevant entities. This emphasis on
public consultation enhances transparency
and fosters trust in the treaty -making
process. By incorporating stakeholder input,
the regulation acknowledges the importance
of considering the broader societal impacts
of international agreements, thereby aligning
treaty governance with democratic
principles.
Further, Article 6 of the regulation
highlights the government's responsibility for
implementing ratified agreements in

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.76


148
accordance with national laws and
regulations. This provision ensures that
international commitments are integrated
into Indonesia's domestic legal framework,
which is a critical aspect of effective treaty
governance. A coherent implementation
strategy hel ps ensure that the benefits of
treaties are realized and that commitments
made at the international level are honored
(Republic of Indonesia, Presidential
Regulation No. 71 of 2020 on the Procedures
for Ratification of International Trade
Treaties, 2020).
While the Presidential Regulation No.
71 of 2020 establishes a robust framework
for the ratification of international trade
agreements, challenges remain in the
practical implementation of these
procedures. One potential challenge is the
need for timely consultations and legislative
approval, which can be affected by political
dynamics within the House of
Representatives or DPR. Delays in the
ratification process can hinder Indonesia’s
ability to respond to emerging trade
opportunities or to renegotiate exi sting
commitments in light of changing economic
conditions. Furthermore, the effectiveness of
the consultation process hinges on the
extent to which stakeholders are engaged
and their feedback is incorporated into
decision-making. Ensuring meaningful
participation from various sectors of society,
including marginalized groups, is essential
for fostering a more equitable approach to
international trade policy.
Treaty governance in the Presidential
Regulation No. 71 of 2020 context focuses
specifically on international trade treaties
during the ratification process. Other
implementing regulations also help shape
treaty governance norms, such as the
Regulation of the Minister of Trade Number
7 of 2021 on the Stages and Procedures for
the Formation of International Trade
Agreements. This Regulation of the Minister
of Trade Number 7 of 2021 outlines the
stages and procedures for creating
international trade agreement s. This
regulation is aimed at establishing clear
guidelines to ensure that trade agreements
made by Indonesia with other countries or
international organizations are consistent,
transparent, and follow the correct legal
framework Republic of Indonesia (Re public
of Indonesia, Regulation of the Minister of
Trade Number 7 of 2021 Stages and
Procedures for the Formation of International
Trade Agreements, 2021).
Treaty governance in this sense sets
forth rules governing sector -specific
contexts. As seen from the duty and
responsibility, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
of Indonesia holds the responsibility to
govern international law depository, as

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.76


149

regulated under Article 17 of Law No. 24 of
2000. The law applies to all agreements
made between the Government of Indonesia
and other countries or international
organizations that have binding legal
implications. These agreements can cover a
wide range of  areas, including political,
security, trade, environmental, cultural, and
scientific matters. Law No. 24/2000 also
makes it clear that agreements at both
bilateral and multilateral levels are subject to
its provisions.
Law No. 24/2000 provides a
comprehensive legal framework for the
governance of treaties in Indonesia. By
outlining the procedures for negotiation,
signing, ratification, implementation, and
termination, the law ensures that Indonesia’s
involvement in inter national agreements is
conducted in a manner that upholds the
principles of sovereignty, transparency, and
national interest. The law also empowers
various institutions, including the President,
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the DPR,
to take active roles in treaty governance,
ensuring that the process is inclusive and
accountable. This is essential especially
since rules and practices governing treaties
may evolve over time (Aust, 2013).

Indonesia’s National Interests by
Promoting Predictability through Treaty
Governance
National interests evolve over time, similar to
rules and practices governing treaties. They
may include, or not include, factors related to
treaty governance, and vice versa. This
article focuses on how treaty governance
promotes predictability in alignment with
Indonesia’s national interests, and how FM
Reg No. 4 of 2023 plays its role in this matter.
The regulation specifies the procedural
stages involved in the creation, ratification,
and implementation of international treaties.
This framework ensures a methodical
approach and adherence to established legal
and administrative practices, thus relating
heavily on national interests of Indonesia in
terms of how Indonesia’s commitments are
interpreted and implemented in such
treaties.
FM Reg No. 4 of 2023 is deeply
intertwined with Indonesia’s national
interests. National interests, which include
security, sovereignty, economic
development, and welfare of the Indonesian
people, form the core considerations in the
management of internati onal treaties. The
regulation ensures that the process of treaty-
making, implementation, and termination
aligns with these fundamental national
objectives. As studied by Fitzmaurice,
sovereignty is a critical element in the
governance of treaties, which al igns directly
with Indonesia's focus on protecting its

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.76


150
sovereignty and territorial integrity. It is
shown that treaty law often needs to balance
international commitments with domestic
constitutional safeguards —a key issue for
states wishing to retain control over their
internal affairs while engaging in global
cooperation (Fitzmaurice, 2005).
In this sense, FM Reg No. 4 of 2023
places significant emphasis on ensuring that
no international agreement compromises
Indonesia's sovereignty. The Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties provides
guidelines on treaty interpretation,
particularly Article 31, which mandates that
treaties be interpreted in good faith
according to their ordinary meaning (Vienna
Convention, 1969). In the Indonesian
context, FM Reg No. 4 of 2023 ensures that
treaties are examined and aligned with
national laws and interests be fore
ratification. This reflects the broader principle
that treaties must be interpreted and
implemented in a manner consistent with a
state’s domestic priorities, an approach that
is especially crucial when balancing
international obligations with national
sovereignty.
Additionally, Indonesia's commitment
to transparency and accountability, as
outlined in the regulation, supports the
interpretive principle of good faith. By
requiring public dissemination of treaty
information and parliamentary approval for
critical treaties, Indonesia ensures that
international obligations do not obscure or
contradict domestic legal and political
frameworks—as regulated in FM Reg No. 4
of 2023 through its Article 15 on education,
transparency, accountability, and public
information accessibility of treaties–and that
international  treaties are implemented in a
manner consistent with a state’s domestic
priorities, an approach that is especially
crucial when balancing international
obligations with national sovereignty.
Indonesia's approach to treaty
termination recognizes that national interests
may change over time, requiring states to
reassess their international commitments.
The ability to terminate or amend treaties, as
allowed under the regulation, is essential for
Indonesia to adapt to shifting global or
regional circumstances, such as changes in
the geopolitical landscape, economic crises,
or new security threats. This relates as well
to justifying principles in the context of treaty
interpretation, in which rights and obligations
are set out in treaties (Christie, 2000).
Indonesia's primary national interest
is the protection of its sovereignty and
territorial integrity. This is a critical
consideration in treaty governance, as
Indonesia aims to ensure that no
international agreement compromises its

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.76


151

independence or threatens its borders. A
core national interest for Indonesia is the
protection of its sovereignty and territorial
integrity. This is a foundational concern
addressed in Law No. 24 of 2000, which
mandates that treaties concerning sensitive
matters such as national defense, security,
and territorial boundaries must undergo
careful consideration. The law explicitly
requires that any treaty impacting national
sovereignty, such as defense alliances or
territorial agreements, must be ratified by
legislation, which involves the approval of the
House of Representatives (DPR).
Further, diplomacy in the context of
treaty governance in FM Reg No. 4 of 2023
further reinforces this by outlining detailed
procedures for negotiating, drafting, and
ratifying treaties that could affect Indonesia’s
sovereignty. The regulation mandates
extensive inter -ministerial consultation,
ensuring that treaties related to territorial or
defense issues do not undermine national
autonomy. This process aligns with
Indonesia’s commitment to maintaining its
independence while engaging in
international cooperation.
In terms of economic growth, Law
No. 24 of 2000 specifies that treaties
affecting economic policies, trade relations,
and financial commitments must also be
carefully scrutinized and, in some cases,
ratified through legislation to ensure they
align with Indonesia’s national economic
goals. Indonesia’s treaty framework requires
that international financial agreements,
including those related to loans or
development aid, are structured to support
sustainable development. This ensures that
international cooper ation contributes to
infrastructure growth, technological
advancement, and the overall economic
prosperity of Indonesia. Treaty governance
ensures this through its reporting
mechanism, thus aligning national interests
with recent diplomacy developments.
Indonesia’s interest in enhancing its
diplomatic influence and playing a leading
role in global governance is an important
consideration in its treaty governance. Law
No. 24 of 2000 and FM Reg No. 4 of 2023
provide mechanisms for Indonesia to actively
engage in multilateral treaties that enhance
its global standing and influence.
Indonesia participates in numerous
multilateral treaties, especially through
regional organizations like ASEAN and
global institutions like the United Nations.
These treaties allow Indonesia to project its
influence on global issues such as trade,
climate change, and security. The regulation
ensures that Indonesia’s participation in
these treaties aligns with its foreign policy
goals of promoting peace, cooperation, and

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.76


152
equitable development. The status of a
treaty, in this sense, also affects how
Indonesia projects its influence on global
issues, as almost all documents signed by
the government of Indonesia are treated as
a treaty (Pratomo & Riyanti, 2018).
Law No. 24 of 2000 and FM Reg No.
4 of 2023 provide a robust legal framework
for ensuring that Indonesia’s national
interests are protected in its treaty
governance. Whether through protecting
sovereignty, promoting economic prosperity,
enhancing security, safeguarding
environmental resources, or advancing
human rights, these legal frameworks ensure
that Indonesia’s participation in international
treaties aligns with its broader national goals.
By following structured procedures for
negotiation, ratification, and implementation,
Indonesia ensures that its engagement in
international agreements is both beneficial
and consistent with its domestic priorities.
Further, as stated in the previous
background section of this article, national
interests influence how a treaty is governed,
thus affecting the treaty governance itself. To
address this probability, this article is of the
view that treaty governance norms  must
develop flexible frameworks that allow for
varying degrees of commitment and
compliance. This includes creating "opt -in"
clauses or phased implementation
schedules that allows states to adjust to
treaties gradually, accommodating their
individual circumstances while still promoting
collective progress.
In addition, it can be noted from the
study cases above that treaty governance
may lack effective implementation if it is not
complemented with robust coordination from
all relevant institutions. Numerous treaties
depend on voluntary compliance without
binding enforcement mechanisms, which
may result in selective observance by states,
particularly when treaty obligations conflict
with national interests.
To address this, the establishment of
independent monitoring and reporting
mechanisms in a treaty governance
framework is recommended to promote
transparency and accountability.
Additionally, instituting a system of peer
review, whereby states assess each other’s
adherence, can foster a collective
responsibility and exert constructive
influence to uphold the treaty's
commitments. This article believes that
collective responsibility and constructive
influence in this peer review system must
also be based on institutional frameworks
that are either related or connected to the
treaty’s oversight mechanism, for example
utilizing ASEAN’s existing reporting
mechanisms to help monitor treaties

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.76


153

between Member States of ASEAN, thus
strengthening collective influence among all
Member States of ASEAN, including those
not directly involved in the treaty -making
process.
As such, existing institutional bodies
may help leverage the monitoring and
enforcement arms of established
organizations to oversee treaty governance,
including treaty compliance eventually.
These mechanisms are believed to be more
accurate and effective since they combine
expertise, established protocols, and
resources in the respective institutions which
can provide consistent, impartial assessment
of treaty adherence.

CONCLUSION
Key Takeaways
FM Reg No. 4 of 2023 outlines the
procedures for these negotiations, requiring
extensive consultation with relevant
domestic institutions. These legal
frameworks ensure that treaties align with
Indonesia’s national interests while
supporting its broader di plomatic goals of
protecting sovereignty, promoting economic
growth, enhancing security, and advancing
global cooperation. Through a structured,
transparent, and accountable process,
Indonesia uses treaties as a key diplomatic
tool to strengthen its intern ational
relationships and enhance its leadership in
global governance.
This article concludes that national
interests may, partially or comprehensively,
affect how treaties are applied, interpreted,
and/or observed by a country. This is shown
in treaty governance mechanisms in which
treaties are properly deposited, monitored,
and evaluated, as regulated under FM Reg
No. 4 of 2023. Related to diplomacy, treaty
governance also aligns national interests of
Indonesia with its diplomacy and current
international trends. Indonesia’s security
diplomacy focuses on building strategic
partnerships while maintaining a policy of
non-alignment. Through treaty governance,
Indonesia engages in cooperation
agreements by ensuring that they strengthen
diplomatic relations without compromising
sovereignty. Through careful treaty
governance, Indonesia advances its
diplomatic goals while safeguarding national
interests, reinforcing its position as a
responsible and influential actor on the
global stage.
Recommendation
As treaty governance cannot depend only on
one institution, Indonesia must carry out
collaborative treaty governance that is critical
for ensuring that international agreements
align with its national interests, legal
frameworks, and diplomatic goals. The

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)

154
effective treaty governance shall be
conducted through a thorough legal review to
ensure alignment with domestic laws and
constitutional principles, involving all relevant
ministries and institutions in the treaty -
making process.
FM Reg No. 4 of 2023 is a significant
step forward in strengthening Indonesia’s
foundational treaty governance. Therefore, it
must be further regulated in implementing
regulations of sector -specific areas as
guided by Law No. 24 of 2000 since FM Reg
No. 4 of 2023 regulates procedural treaty
governance steps, and as such must be
further complemented with supporting
regulations from sector -specific institutions.
The combination of both FM Reg No. 4 of
2023 and such supporting regulations must
ensure that no t reaty is concluded without
considering its potential impacts on other
areas of governance. Through treaty
governance that is robust and meets its
national interests, Indonesia can enhance its
diplomatic effectiveness and better protect
its sovereignty and development goals in the
international arena.

Abstrak

Penelitian ini mengkaji inisiatif yang dilakukan ole h pemerintah Indonesia dalam mengadvokasi
tujuan bersama dalam mengatasi tantangan perubahan iklim global dengan menggambarkan
pencapaian konservasi mangrove di Bali. Penelitian ini menggunakan pendekatan kualitatif
dengan teknik pengumpulan data melalui studi pustaka. Dengan menggunakan konsep diplomasi
publik dan soft power, hasil penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa langkah Presiden Republik
Indonesia Joko Widodo dalam menunjukkan konservasi ma ngrove pada delegasi World Water
Forum 2024 adalah bentuk diplomasi  publik yang bertujuan mengartikulasikan kebijakan
Indonesia yang selaras dengan inisiatif global dalam meminimalkan tantangan perubahan iklim.
Dalam konteks ini, Indonesia ingin menunjukkan peran nya sebagai negara yang berkomitmen
melestarikan kawasan man grove yang diakui sebagai elemen penting dalam memerangi
perubahan iklim. Di samping itu ada upaya Indonesia untuk menepis persepsi -persepsi negatif
komunitas internasional terhadap Indonesia yang selama ini dianggap turut berkontribusi pada
penyebab perubahan iklim. Indonesia juga bercita-cita untuk melibatkan komunitas internasional
dalam komitmen bersama untuk melakukan tindakan substantif dalam perjuangan yang sedang
berlangsung melawan perubahan iklim.

Kata Kunci: Diplomasi publik, Indonesia, Konservasi mangrove, World Water Forum.

PENDAHULUAN
Penelitian ini menganalisis diplomasi publik
Indonesia pada perhelatan World Water
Forum (WWF) ke-10. Diplomasi publik yang
dimaksud secara khusus merujuk pada
inisiatif yang dilakukan oleh Presiden
Republik Indonesia, Joko Widodo, yang
memperlihatkan konservasi mangrove di
Taman Hutan Nasional (Tahura) Ngurah Rai
kepada delegasi WWF (Sekretariat Kabinet
Republik Indonesia, 2024). Topik ini menarik
dan penting untuk dikaji karena beberapa
pertimbangan. Pertama, terdapat pola dan
inisiatif yang konsisten yang dilaksanakan
oleh Presiden Indonesia di sejumlah forum
internasional. Misalnya, pada Konferensi
Tingkat Tinggi (KTT) G20 tah un 2022, Joko
Widodo mengajak para pemimpin G20 untuk
menyaksikan secara langsung kegiatan
konservasi mangrove di Tahura Ngurah Rai,
Bali, dan langkah yang serupa kembali
digunakan pada perhelatan WWF di
Indonesia. Inisiatif berulang ini menunjukkan
bahwa ada pesan khusus yang ingin
disampaikan oleh pemerintah Indonesia
kepada masyarakat internasional. Kedua,
topik ini membantu memahami kebijakan
luar negeri Indonesia, termasuk
mengungkap bagaimana Indonesia
membangun citra dan pengaruhnya di
tingkat global. Ketiga, diplomasi publik yang
menggunakan konservasi mangrove
sebagai sarana menandai adanya suatu
pendekatan yang berbeda dengan yang
umumnya dilakukan oleh negara -negara
dalam membangun citra internasionalnya,
termasuk Indonesia sendiri yang baru dalam
beberapa dekade terakhir menggunakan
pendekatan ini.
  Tahun 2024 Indonesia mendapat
kepercayaan global sebagai tuan rumah
kegiatan World Water Forum (WWF) ke-10,
yang diadakan di Bali pada 18 hingga 25 Mei
2024. WWF merupakan agenda air terbesar
di dunia, diselenggarakan setiap tiga tahun
di bawah naungan World Water Council
sejak tahun 1997 (Salman, 2003). WWF
melibatkan serangkaian konferensi
internasional sebagai platform bagi para
pemangku kepentingan terkait air maupun
para pengambil kebijakan untuk terlibat
bersama dalam menangani isu-isu terkait air
global, khususnya mengadvokasi hak asasi
manusia atas air. Output dari WWF biasanya
berupa resolusi dan rencana aksi dalam
menghadapi tantangan terkait air (Varady,
Meehan and McGovern, 2009). WWF ke-10
di Bali dihadiri kurang lebih 64 ribu peserta
dari 160 negara, yang terlibat dalam 278 sesi
diskusi (World Water Forum Secretariat,
2024). Indonesia berhasil menyusun
sejumlah inisiatif terkait air yang kemudian
akan menjadi pijakan bagi banyak negara.
Selain itu, WWF juga merumuskan Deklarasi
Menteri yang mencakup aspek -aspek

penting seperti pembentukan pusat
keunggulan untuk ketahanan air dan iklim,
pengelolaan sumber daya air di pulau-pulau
kecil, dan proposal untuk memperingati Hari
Danau Sedunia (Saputra, 2024).
  Setelah kegiatan konferensi,
Presiden Republik Indonesia, Joko Widodo,
mengajak para delegasi WWF ke -10 untuk
mengunjungi Taman Hutan Ngurah Rai
(Tahura) Bali, yang merupakan area khusus
untuk Konservasi mangrove. Presiden Joko
Widodo menjelaskan penting nya zona
konservasi ini sebagai tempat perlindungan
bagi keanekaragaman hayati sekaligus
menjadi pusat pendidikan ekowisata. Dalam
momentum tersebut, presiden Indonesia
menunjukkan wilayah penanaman
Mangrove di sepanjang muara yang
dilengkapi dengan teknologi listrik bertenaga
surya sebagai sumber daya pembangkit
listrik di berbagai area konservasi mangrove
(Antara News , 2024). Joko Widodo juga
menunjukkan fasilitas pembibitan mangrove,
yang telah dikembangkan menggunakan
kemajuan teknologi modern, termasuk
inovasi dalam sistem pengelolaan air yang
memungkinkan bibit tanaman berkembang
secara independen. Fasilitas ini diakui
sebagai satu-satunya pembibitan mangrove
modern di Indonesia. Joko Widodo juga
secara simbolis menyerahkan bibit
mangrove kepada anak -anak, sehingga
mendorong keterlibatan mereka dalam
konservasi lingkungan (Sekretariat Kabinet
Republik Indonesia, 2024). Oleh karena itu,
penelitian ini mengkaji inisiatif Joko Widodo
tersebut, mengeksplorasi pesan -pesan
mendasar yang ingin disampaikan
Indonesia, dan menganalisis mengapa
pemerintah menggunakan konservasi
mangrove sebagai mekanisme dalam
diplomasi publiknya.
  Sejumlah akademisi telah mengkaji
tentang diplomasi Indonesia pada
perhelatan WWF di Bali 2024, salah satunya
adalah Ayu Puspitasari dan koleganya
dalam penelitian yang berjudul Diplomasi
Budaya Indonesia Dalam Memperkenalkan
Subak dan Jalur Rempah Di Forum Air Dunia
2024. Dalam penelitiannya, Puspitasari dkk
mengkaji bagaimana Indonesia
menampilkan warisan budayanya,
khususnya sistem irigasi subak dan rute
rempah-rempah bersejarah, selama WWF
ke-10. Mereka berargumen bahwa WWF
berfungsi sebagai platform bagi Indonesia
untuk mempresentasikan identitas dan nilai-
nilai budayanya kepada khalayak global.
Hasil penelitian Puspitasari dkk
menunjukkan bahwa norma dan nilai -nilai
budaya masyarakat Bali dimanfaatkan
sebagai soft power  oleh pemerintah
Indonesia. Menurut mereka, strategi ini
bertujuan untuk mendapatkan pengakuan

Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.74


160
internasional dan apresiasi terhadap warisan
budaya Indonesia yang kaya (Puspitasari,
Rangga and Wicaksono, 2024).
  Penelitian serupa juga dilakukan oleh
Maria Veni Cista Wau dan koleganya, yang
berjudul Bali Street Carnival dan Melasti
Water Carnival Sebagai Bentuk Diplomasi
Budaya Indonesia Dalam the 10th World
Water Forum . Mereka secara khusus
meneliti peran Karnaval Jalan Bali dan
Karnaval Air Melasti sebagai instrumen
diplomasi budaya. Menurut Wau dkk,
peristiwa ini adalah sarana untuk
mempromosikan budaya Indonesia di
panggung internasional. H asil penelitian
mereka menunjukkan bahwa kedua karnaval
berfungsi sebagai alat yang efektif untuk
meningkatkan pariwisata dan meningkatkan
pengakuan warisan budaya Indonesia.
Mereka mencontohkan bagaimana budaya
dapat bertindak sebagai bentuk soft power
untuk menarik perhatian internasional.
Mereka berargumen bahwa diplomasi
budaya dan soft power sangat penting untuk
melestarikan warisan budaya dan
meningkatkan status global Indonesia (Wau,
Luerdi and Nugrahayuningtyas, 2024).
  Dari beberapa literatur yang ada,
mereka sepakat dan mengakui bahwa
budaya memiliki fungsi penting sebagai
mekanisme diplomasi Indonesia pada acara
World Water Forum 2024 yang diadakan di
Bali. Namun demikian, masih terdapat
elemen-elemen atau sarana diplomasi lain
yang digunakan Indonesia pada acara
WWF, dan artikel-artikel ilmiah tersebut tidak
menjelaskan secara komprehensif sarana
yang penulis maksud, dalam hal ini
konservasi mangrove .  Oleh karena itu,
penelitian ini berusaha untuk menyajikan
perspektif baru mengenai pendekatan
diplomatik alternatif yang digunakan oleh
Indonesia, khususnya berfokus pada
diplomasi publik yang memanfaatkan
konservasi mangrove sebagai saluran untuk
mengartikulasikan kebijakan Indonesia
dalam menghadapi tantangan perubahan
iklim global kepada publik internasional
dalam perhelatan WWF di Bali.


KERANGKA KONSEPTUAL
Diplomasi Publik
Diplomasi publik dapat dicirikan sebagai
upaya strategis untuk mendapatkan
dukungan publik internasional untuk
pemerintah suatu negara, maupun inisiatif
kebijakan luar negerinya yang terkait. Praktik
ini mencakup interaksi dengan warga negara
asing untuk membentuk pandangan dan
sentimen mereka mengenai suatu negara
dan kerangka kebijakannya (Snow, 2004).
Menurut Josep Nye, Diplomasi publik
meliputi seni komunikasi, penyebaran ide
dan informasi yang strategis untuk

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.74


161

mempengaruhi persepsi, menumbuhkan
kepercayaan, dan menambah soft power .
Tujuan utama Diplomasi publik adalah untuk
mempengaruhi sentimen publik dan
membangun lingkungan yang kondusif yang
mendukung kebijakan pemerintah.
Sasarannya adalah entitas non -negara,
termasuk individu, media massa, organisasi
non-pemerintah, dan aktor  terkait lainnya
(Nye, 2008).
  Penstudi hubungan internasional
lainnya menyebutkan bahwa Diplomasi
publik didefinisikan sebagai tindakan yang
diambil oleh pemerintah untuk
mempengaruhi pendapat publik atau elit
negara lain, yang bertujuan untuk
menyelaraskan kebijakan luar negeri dengan
keuntungannya. Dalam konteks ini
Diplomasi publik dicirikan sebagai proses
komunikasi dengan publik asing, yang
bermaksud untuk menumbuhkan
pemahaman tentang gagasan, cita -cita,
institusi, budaya, dan kebijakan suatu
bangsa saat ini (Mor, 2007). Hal ini sejalan
dengan pendapat Jan Melissen yang
mengartikulasikan Diplomasi publik sebagai
upaya komunikatif yang dilakukan oleh
pemerintah yang bertujuan melibatkan
masyarakat internasional untuk menjelaskan
prinsip-prinsip dan nilai -nilai bangsanya,
yang kemudian akan menciptakan opi ni
publik yang memungkinkan para pemimpin
negara sasaran mengambil keputusan yang
mendukung tujuan kebijakan luar negeri
negara yang melakukan Diplomasi publik
(Melissen, 2005).
  Diplomasi publik berasumsi bahwa
komunikasi yang efektif sangat penting untuk
mempengaruhi opini publik asing. Artinya,
strategi komunikasi sangat penting untuk
kesuksesan Diplomasi publik. Selanjutnya
diasumsikan bahwa Diplomasi publik
bertujuan untuk menumbuhkan saling
pengertian antarnegara. Ini melibatkan tidak
hanya mempromosikan citra negara tetapi
juga memahami perspektif dan budaya
negara lain, yang sangat penting untuk
membangun hubungan. Diplomasi publik
juga beroperasi dengan asumsi bahwa
terlibat langsung dengan audiens asing
dapat mengarah pada persepsi dan
hubungan yang lebih menguntungkan.
Asumsi lainnya mengatakan bahwa
Diplomasi publik bukan hanya tentang
keuntungan jangka pendek tetapi berfokus
pada membangun hubungan jangka panjang
(Melissen, 2005).
  Sementara itu, menurut Joseph S.
Nye, beberapa asumsi dasar Diplomasi
publik meliputi: Pertama, dalam Diplomasi
publik diakui perlunya memiliki citra nasional
yang menarik dan kredibel untuk
mempengaruhi persepsi publik. Kedua, soft
power suatu bangsa, yang mencakup

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.74


162
budaya, nilai -nilai etika, dan kebijakannya,
memiliki kapasitas untuk secara signifikan
mempengaruhi persepsi publik internasional,
karena soft power  berperan penting dalam
membentuk sudut pandang, membina
hubungan positif, dan mencapai hasil yang
diinginkan melalui sarana daya tarik dan
persuasi, bukan melalui tindakan koersif.
Ketiga, komunikasi yang sukses ditandai
dengan sifat timbal baliknya. Oleh karena itu,
sangat penting untuk memahami audiens
target dalam Diplomasi publik. Keempat,
kemampuan suatu negara untuk
berkomunikasi secara efektif dengan
komunitas global sangat penting dalam
membentuk persepsi, menyebarkan pesan,
dan menumbuhkan kepercayaan. Terakhir,
Diplomasi publik mengakui pengaruh
signifikan entitas non -negara, termasuk
organisasi non -pemerintah (LSM), badan
perusahaan, dan lembaga media, dalam
proses membentuk persepsi publik (Nye,
2008).

Soft Power
Soft power  adalah sebuah konsep yang
diperkenalkan oleh Joseph Nye salah
satunya melalui bukunya yang berjudul
Bound to lead: the changing nature of
American power  pada tahun 1990. Nye
menekankan bahwa untuk mencapai
kepentingan nasional, suatu negara tidak
selalu menggunakan pendekatan tradisional
yang umumnya adalah kekuatan militer dan
ekonomi tetapi dengan apa yang ia sebut
sebagai soft power. Nye mendefinisikan soft
power sebagai kemampuan suatu negara
untuk mencapai kepentingan nasionalnya
melalui daya tarik at au kekuatan
nontradisional dan bukan melalui paksaan.
Menurut Nye, soft power dapat
memungkinkan suatu negara menunjukkan
keunggulannya, yang pada akhirnya akan
membuat negara lain menerima dan tertarik
untuk mengikuti negara yang tersebut
secara sukarela. Adapun sumber -sumber
soft power suatu negara dapat berasal dari
citra positif, ide, nilai -nilai, budaya, norma,
dan sebagainya, yang nantinya dapat
menghasilkan opini publik yang lebih positif
bagi negara yang memiliki soft power
tersebut (Nye, 1990a).
  Definisi soft power kembali
ditekankan oleh Nye dalam bukunya yang
berjudul Soft Power: The Means to Success
in World Politics , Nye menjelaskan bahwa
soft power adalah kemampuan suatu negara
untuk mempengaruhi negara lain untuk
tertarik melakukan apa yang diinginkan oleh
negara tersebut tanpa melalui paksaan (Nye,
2005). Dalam konteks ini, ketika suatu
negara dapat mempengaruhi negara lain
tanpa menggunakan kekuatan fisik
melainkan melalui daya tarik budaya, nilai -
nilai, ide, dan norma, yang membuat negara
lain secara sukarela menginginkan hal yang

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.74


163

sama, maka hal itu dapat dikatakan sebagai
soft power karena negara tersebut berhasil
meyakinkan negara lain untuk mengikuti
kehendaknya tanpa paksaan langsung.
  Ada beberapa asumsi dasar soft
power. Pertama, suatu negara dapat
mempengaruhi negara atau pihak lain bukan
melalui paksaan atau kekuatan, tetapi
dengan menarik mereka pada cita -cita dan
nilai-nilainya. Daya tarik ini dapat berasal
dari daya tarik budaya, nilai -nilai politik, dan
kebijakan l uar negeri yang beresonansi
positif dengan negara lain (Nye, 1990b).
Dalam konteks ini, negara yang memiliki soft
power kuat dapat menarik perhatian dan
dukungan negara lain karena nilai -nilai
politik, budaya, atau kebijakan luar
negerinya dianggap positif atau inspiratif.
Artinya, negara tersebut mampu
mempengaruhi pihak lain melalui
ketertarikan dan penghargaan, bukan
melalui ancaman atau kekuatan fisik.
  Asumsi kedua bahwa soft power
beroperasi melalui cara -cara non -militer,
menekankan pada diplomasi, pertukaran
budaya, dan kesuksesan ekonomi sebagai
alat untuk mempengaruhi. Artinya, negara
dapat mencapai tujuan mereka lebih efektif
melalui persuasi daripada melalui ancaman.
Asumsi ini menunjukkan bahwa soft power
beroperasi melalui cara -cara yang lebih
halus seperti diplomasi, yang bertumpu pada
daya tarik dan persuasi. Hal ini akan
membuat negara lain lebih cenderung
bekerja sama karena mereka mengagumi
atau terinspirasi oleh negara yang
mempraktikkan soft power  (Nye, 1990a).
Soft power  memungkinkan negara untuk
mencapai tujuan mereka dengan cara yang
lebih damai dan berkelanjutan. Ketika
sebuah negara berhasil membangun citra
positif melalui budaya, nilai -nilai, atau
keberhasilan ekonomi, negara lain lebih
mungkin untuk mendukung kepent ingannya
secara sukarela. Selain itu, negara yang
berhasil menggunakan soft power  dapat
memperluas pengaruhnya secara global
tanpa harus menggunakan sumber daya
militer yang mahal atau merusak hubungan
internasional. Hal itulah mengapa menurut
Joseph Nye, soft power merupakan elemen
penting dalam konteks politik kontemporer
untuk mencapai tujuan dengan cara yang
lebih cerdas (Nye, 2005).
  Asumsi ketiga dari soft power
menyatakan bahwa suatu negara bisa
menyelaraskan kepentingannya dengan
kepentingan pihak lain melalui promosi nilai-
nilai bersama. Dalam konteks hubungan
internasional, jika suatu negara mampu
mengkomunikasikan dan mewujudkan nilai -
nilai tersebut secara e fektif, hal ini dapat
membangun citra positif di mata negara lain.
Akibatnya, negara -negara lain akan

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.74


164
mengagumi dan mungkin terinspirasi oleh
pendekatan tersebut, yang berpotensi
memperkuat hubungan internasional serta
meningkatkan kerjasama global (Yigit,
2024). Keempat, soft power  sangat
bergantung pada bagaimana sebuah negara
dipersepsikan oleh negara lain. Premisnya
adalah bahwa citra dan reputasi yang baik
dapat secara signifikan memperkuat
kemampuan negara tersebut dalam
mempengaruhi pihak lain. Persepsi ini bisa
terbentuk melalui kebijakan luar negeri yang
berhasil dan penyebaran nilai -nilai yang
mendapat respons positif secara global
(Nye, 2021).

METODE PENELITIAN
Penelitian ini menggunakan metode kualitatif
analitis dengan memaparkan data dan
mengelaborasi praktik Diplomasi publik
Indonesia pada perhelatan World Water
Forum 2024 di Bali. Penggunaan metode
kualitatif didasarkan pada analisis data dan
bukti-bukti yang tidak memerlukan model -
model statistik, melainkan analisis yang
sifatnya interpretatif.
 Penulis mengombinasikan jenis data
dalam penelitian ini yaitu data sekunder dan
primer. Data sekunder dikumpulkan melalui
teknik studi literatur dari dokumen -dokumen
yang dipublikasikan oleh institusi resmi atau
negara, jurnal ilmiah, buku, media berita dan
artikel, serta website resmi dari organisasi -
organisasi dan negara. Sementara itu, data
primer dikumpulkan melalui pidato atau
pernyataan-pernyataan pemerintah
Indonesia maupun komunitas internasional
lainnya. Data yang terkumpul kemudian
dianalisis menggunakan metode analisis
kualitatif yang sifatnya interpretatif.

HASIL DAN PEMBAHASAN
Persepsi Global Terhadap Indonesia
Mengenai Isu Lingkungan
Indonesia sering dianggap oleh komunitas
internasional sebagai negara yang
memainkan peran penting dalam upaya
global menghadapi tantangan lingkungan
seperti perubahan iklim. Hal ini tidak lepas
dari keberadaan Indonesia sebagai negara
yang memiliki sejuml ah sumber daya
potensial yang dapat berkontribusi pada
penanggulangan perubahan iklim. Sebagai
negara dengan luas hutan hujan tropis
terluas ketiga di dunia dengan luas yang
mencapai 125,76 hektar atau setara dengan
62,97% dari total luas daratan Indonesia ,
membuat Indonesia sering diakui sebagai
paru-paru dunia (satria, 2023). Hutan hujan
tropis sendiri memiliki peran yang sangat
signifikan pada siklus karbon global. Hutan
dapat menyerap karbon dari atmosfer dalam
pertumbuhannya, yang kemudian akan
meminimalkan penyebab perubahan iklim
(Dewi, 2024). Kementerian Koordinator
Bidang Kemaritiman dan Investasi

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.74


165

menyebutkan bahwa hutan hujan tropis
Indonesia dapat menyerap emisi karbon
sebesar 25,18 miliar ton (Annur, 2022).
 Selain itu, Indonesia juga merupakan
negara dengan luas ekosistem Mangrove
terbesar di dunia. Indonesia mempunyai luas
Mangrove sebesar 3.489.140,68 hektar,
setara dengan 23% ekosistem Mangrove
dunia yaitu dari total luas 16.530.000 hektar
(Kementerian Lingkungan Hidup dan
Kehutanan, 2017) . Keberadaan Mangrove
dapat membantu mitigasi perubahan iklim
karena sifatnya yang dapat menyerap dan
menyimpan karbon dalam jumlah yang
sangat besar dari lautan, laut, dan udara.
Hutan Mangrove di Indonesia mampu
menyerap emisi karbon sekitar 950 ton
karbon per hektar atau setara 33 miliar
karbon untuk seluruh hutan Mangrove di
Indonesia (Annur, 2022). Mangrove juga
dapat menyehatkan terumbu karang yang
ada di sekitarnya, dimana terumbu karang
memiliki kemampuan menyerap karbon
dioksida, bahkan, organisme ini diklaim
mampu menyerap karbon tiga kali lebih baik
dibandingkan dengan pepohonan (Fitria and
Dwiyanoto, 2021) . Selain itu, Mangrove
dapat meningkatkan kemampuan bertahan
masyarakat pesisir terhadap dampak
perubahan iklim.
 Peran penting Indonesia dalam isu
lingkungan juga dapat ditelaah dari
keterlibatannya dalam forum -forum dan
kerjasama internasional yang bersifat
multilateral dan bilateral terkait perubahan
iklim. Sebagai contoh, terlibat dalam KTT
Bumi/United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development  (UNCED),
Protokol Kyoto , United Nations Framework
Conventions on Climate Change  (UNFCC),
Paris Agreement , ASEAN Agreement on
Transboundary Haze Pollution  (AATHP),
ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on the
Environment (AMME), dan forum kerjasama
lainnya. Keterlibatan Indonesia dalam forum-
forum ini kemudian semakin memperkuat
pandangan bahwa Indonesia punya peran
yang cukup signifikan dalam isu -isu terkait
lingkungan.
  Namun, perspektif masyarakat global
atau internasional terhadap Indonesia dalam
konteks isu lingkungan sering kali kurang
menguntungkan. Hal ini disebabkan oleh
masih banyaknya peristiwa dan kondisi
domestik Indonesia yang dianggap turut
berkontribusi signifikan sebagai penyebab
perubahan iklim itu sendiri. Jadi, walaupun
memiliki banyak sumber daya penting dalam
upaya mitigasi perubahan iklim, hal itu tidak
cukup kuat untuk menjadi alasan bagi
Indonesia untuk luput dari kritik komunitas
internasional dal am hal isu -isu lingkungan.
Misalnya, pada tahun 2021 Greenpeace
mengkritik pidato Presiden Joko Widodo

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.74


166
pada KTT COP26. NGO tersebut menilai
bahwa pidato Joko Widodo tidak
menunjukkan komitmen yang serius dan
ambisius dalam menghadapi perubahan
iklim. Greenpeace berpendapat bahwa
Indonesia seharusnya menjadi contoh bagi
negara-negara berkembang dalam
mengurangi ketergantungan pada energi
kotor dan mewujudkan nol deforestasi, tanpa
harus bergantung pada dukungan
internasional (Wicaksono, 2021).
 Selain itu, Perserikatan Bangsa -
Bangsa (PBB) juga pernah mengkritik
negara-negara termasuk Indonesia dan
mempertanyakan komitmennya untuk
mengurangi emisi karbon, dimana suhu
global terus meningkat dan emisi karbon
diperkirakan meningkat sebesar 16% hingga
tahun 2030 (Detiknews, 2021). Situasi ini
dianggap bertentangan dengan seruan
Indonesia untuk pengurangan emisi yang
cepat dan signifikan. Bahkan hanya
sebagian kecil negara yang menunjukkan
komitmen nyata untuk memperkuat target
pengurangan emisi.
 Sehubungan dengan itu, Indonesia
merupakan salah satu penghasil emisi
karbon terbesar di dunia. Pada tahun 2022,
emisi karbon Indonesia meningkat sebesar
18,3%, yang merupakan peningkatan
tertinggi dibandingkan negara -negara lain.
Sebanyak 43,59% dari total emisi Indonesia
berasal dari deforestasi dan penggunaan
lahan yang menunjukkan lemahnya
perlindungan hutan (Wicaksono, 2023). Di
samping itu, komunitas internasional
mengkritik Indonesia karena masih
bergantung pada batu bara. Pada tahun
2023, Indonesia mencatat rekor baru,
dimana pada awal Desember produksi batu
bara mencapai 703,14 juta ton, melebihi
target sebesar 694,5 juta  ton (Wicaksono,
2023).

 Sejak peristiwa kebakaran hutan
pada tahun 1997 dan 1998 yang
menyebabkan degradasi lingkungan yang
parah, bahkan mempengaruhi negara -
negara tetangga di Asia Tenggara,
komunitas internasional telah mengkritik

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.74


167

Indonesia yang dianggap lambat dalam
menanggapi krisis kebakaran hutan.
Kejadian pembakaran hutan parah yang
kembali berulang pada tahun 2019 semakin
meningkatkan kritik internasional terhadap
Indonesia. Indonesia dianggap belum
menerapkan langkah -langkah efektif untuk
mencegah atau mengendalikan kebakaran,
yang sering dikaitkan dengan pembukaan
lahan ilegal untuk pertanian, khususnya
perkebunan kelapa sawit (Gellert, 1998).
Selain itu, kebakaran hutan juga telah
membuat hubungan Indonesia tegang
dengan tetangganya, khususnya Malaysia
dan Singapura, yang telah terkena dampak
langsung oleh asap. Negara-negara ini telah
menyerukan Indonesia untuk mengambil
lebih banyak tanggun g jawab dan tindakan
untuk mengurangi kebakaran, yang
menyebabkan ketegangan diplomatik
(detikcom, 2023).
 Menurut data statistik yang diberikan
Kementerian Lingkungan Hidup dan
Kehutanan, pada periode Januari hingga
Agustus 2023, insiden kebakaran hutan dan
lahan (karhutla) di seluruh Indonesia, yang
meliputi area seluas 267.935,59 hektar,
mengalami peningkat an melampaui total
luas yang terkena dampak kebakaran hutan
selama keseluruhan tahun 2022, meskipun
kebakaran hutan cenderung menurun jika
dibandingkan tahun 2019 -2021.
Pengamatan ini menunjukkan bahwa
intensitas kebakaran tahun 2023 jauh lebih
besar daripada tahun 2022, baik dari luas
wilayah karhutlah maupun jumlah karhutla
yang mencapai 487 yang tersebar di 5
provinsi terbanyak (Aceh 68 kejadian,
Kepulauan Bangka Belitung 48 kejadian,
Kalimantan Tengah dan Kalimantan Selatan
43 kejadian dan Jawa Tengah 41 kejadian).
Dalam jangka waktu Januari hingga Agustus
2023, kebakaran hutan dan lahan di
Indonesia telah menghasilkan sekitar 32,9
juta ton setara karbon dioksida (CO2e) yang
secara signifikan lebih tinggi dari emisi yang
tercatat pada tahun 2022, yang ha nya
berjumlah 23,5 juta ton CO2e (Ahdiat, 2023).

Lahan di Indonesia (2019-Agustus 2023)

2023 267.935
(Sumber: Kementerian Lingkungan Hidup dan
Kehutanan, 2023)

 Indonesia juga sering menjadi
sorotan atas berkurangnya luas area
Mangrove.. Saat ini terjadi penurunan luasan
hutan Mangrove di seluruh dunia karena
berbagai aktivitas manusia, dan PBB
mengklaim bahwa Indonesia menduduki

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.74


168
posisi pertama sebagai negara yang paling
banyak kehilangan area Mangrove yang
cukup luas (Mcowen et al. , 2023). Data
Kementerian Lingkungan Hidup dan
Kehutanan (KLHK) periode 2010 sampai
2020 menyebutkan, Indonesia telah
kehilangan luas tutupan mangrove hampir
seluas 200 ribu hektare. Kehilangan tutupan
mangrove tertinggi terjadi pada 2016, yaitu
sebebsar 60 ribu hektare (Republika, 2020 ).
Dalam sumber yang berbeda dijelaskan
bahwa dalam 30 tahun, Indonesia
kehilangan 900 ribu hektare mangrove dari
smeula 4,2 juta hektare menjadi hanya 3,3
juta hektare ( Tempo, 2020 ). Pengurangan
luasan area Mangrove kemudian
berkontribusi pada rusaknya lingkungan, dan
percepatan perubahan iklim.
 Persoalan lainnya terkait dengan
angka deforestasi di Indonesia yang masih
terbilang tinggi. Indonesia merupakan yang
terbesar keempat di dunia dalam hal laju
deforestasi akibat penebangan hutan untuk
industri, pertambangan, dan perkebunan
(Alexander, 2024). Data dari Badan Pusat
Statistik menyebutkan bahwa pada tahun
2022, sekitar 104.032,5 hektar area lahan
yang terkena deforestasi, 73.130,1 hektar di
antaranya adalah kawasan hutan, dan
30.902,4 hektar area penggunaan lain atau
bukan kawasan hutan (Badan Pusat
Statistik, 2024) . Persoalan deforestasi
menjadi perhatian komunitas internasional
karena menyebabkan hilangnya habitat bagi
banyak spesies. Selain itu, pohon yang
ditebang melepaskan karbon dioksida yang
tersimpan, berkontribusi pada perubahan
iklim global, dan masih banyak lagi dampak
buruk dari deforestasi. Salah satu contoh
kritik in ternasional terhadap deforestasi di
Indonesia adalah diberlakukannya UU anti
deforestasi Uni Eropa bagi Indonesia (Dewi
A and Agarta, 2023).

(Sumber: Badan Pusat Statistik, 2024)
 Secara umum, pandangan global
terhadap Indonesia terkait isu lingkungan
menunjukkan beragam reaksi. Namun,
banyak negara, organisasi internasional, dan
komunitas global yang beranggapan bahwa
Indonesia berperan dalam mempercepat
perubahan iklim akibat berbagai peristiwa
dan kondisi di dalam negeri. Banyak pula
yang meragukan komitmen Indonesia dalam
menghadapi perubahan iklim.Pemerintah
Indonesia menyadari kritik-kritik ini, sehingga
dalam beberapa dekade terakhir, Indonesia
telah berupaya untuk mengatasi t uduhan
tersebut.

Indonesia dan World Water Forum
Tahun 2024,ndonesia diberi kepercayaan
menjadi tuan rumah perhelatan World Water
Forum (WWF), sebuah perhelatan
internasional yang di dalamnya banyak
membahas isu -isu lingkungan. WWF
berkembang sebagai forum penting untuk
mengatasi masalah air global. Forum ini
berfungsi sebagai platform dialog antara
para pemangku kepentingan, pemerintah,
LSM, dan sektor swasta, untuk menentukan
solusi bersama mengatasi tantangan global
terkait air. WWF dimulai pada tahun 1997 di
Marrakech, Maroko sebagai tindak lanjut dari
inisiatif yang pernah dibahas p ada tahun
1970-an. Dalam upaya mencapai solusi
terhadap isu air, WWF saat itu melibatkan
serangkaian konferensi internasional dan
upaya-upaya kerja sama (Gleick and Lane,
2005). Pertemuan berikutnya yang diadakan
di Den Haag (2000) dan Kyoto (2003) secara
signifikan meningkatkan pengaruh WWF
dalam perumusan kebijakan air
internasional, yang memuncak pada
pembentukan berbagai resolusi dan rencana
aksi strategis yang didedikasikan  untuk
promosi pengelolaan air berkelanjutan
(Salman, 2003). WWF dilaksanakan setiap
tiga tahun, dengan negara tuan rumah yang
berbeda dalam setiap perhelatannya.
Hingga tahun 2024, penyelenggaraan WWF
telah berlangsung sebanyak 10 kali. Adapun
negara-negara yang pernah menjadi tuan
rumah WWF di antaranya adalah Maroko,
Belanda, Jepang, Meksiko, Turki, Prancis,
Korea Selatan, Brasil, Senegal, dan
Indonesia (CNN Indonesia, 2024).
 WWF memiliki peran penting dalam
memajukan tujuan Dewan Air Dunia dan
komunitas air global dengan mengatasi isu -
isu air. Untuk mencapai hal tersebut, forum
ini sengaja dirancang untuk mencapai
beberapa tujuan sebagai berikut: Pertama,
memfasilitasi keterl ibatan pemangku
kepentingan dalam inisiatif terkait air,
sehingga memungkinkan semua pihak untuk
secara kolaboratif mengembangkan visi
yang terpadu. Kedua, membentuk forum
bagi semua pemangku kepentingan untuk
berbagi pengetahuan, terlibat dalam
pembelajaran, mendorong kolaborasi, dan
memulai langkah -langkah konkret yang
bertujuan untuk meningkatkan pengelolaan
dan pengembangan sumber daya dan
layanan air. Ketiga, mempromosikan
keterlibatan pembuat kebijakan dan
pembuat keputusan dalam dialog untuk
menetapkan komitmen untuk kemajuan
pengelolaan sumber daya air dan pemberian
layanan. Keempat, meningkatkan kesadaran
mengenai isu -isu terkait air dalam
masyarakat yang lebih luas, terutama
melalui pemanfaatan saluran media. Kelima,
ini mendorong konsep dan ide ya ng inovatif
untuk mencapai solusi untuk pengelolaan air

(The 10th World Water Forum Secretariat,
2024).
 Pelaksanaan WWF ke -10
diselenggarakan di Bali pada 18 -25 Mei
2024. Sebagai tuan rumah, Indonesia
menempati posisi yang sangat penting
dalam memfasilitasi pencapaian tujuan yang
ditetapkan oleh platform internasional ini.
Terlebih lagi Indonesia sendiri turut memiliki
tanggung jawab besar untuk memenuhi
kebutuhan air pada 260 juta populasi dan
berbagai aktivitas industrinya (The 10th
World Water Forum Secretariat, 2024) .
Maka, saat Indonesia ditetapkan sebagai
tuan rumah WWF, pemerintah mulai
mengevaluasi secara komprehensif
berbagai strategi untuk memastikan
keberhasilan kegiatan tersebut, mulai dari
mempersiapkan tempat dan akomodasi
yang sesuai standar internasional r amah
lingkungan. Pemerintah juga merencanakan
untuk membangun kerangka kerja
kolaboratif yang bukan hanya melibatkan
pemerintah saja, tetapi juga sektor swasta,
organisasi masyarakat sipil, termasuk
pemuda kaum pelajar. Di samping itu,
Indonesia secara akt if memaksimalkan
berbagai inisiatif dan inovasi inovatif dalam
bidang pengelolaan air dan konservasi.
Misalnya, penerapan teknologi modern
untuk meningkatkan efisiensi air di berbagai
sektor seperti pertanian, perkebunan,
pertambangan, industri, dan pengelolaan
lembah sungai (Ali, 2024).
 WWF ke-10 di Indonesia mengusung
tema Water for Shared Prosperity , dengan
beberapa sub tema yaitu: Water Security
and Prosperity ; Water for Humans and
Nature; Disaster Risk Reduction and
Management; Governance, Cooperation and
Hydro-diplomacy; Sustainable Water
Finance; dan Knowledge and Innovation .
Tema dan sub tema tersebut merefleksikan
bahwa air adalah sumber daya vital yang
sangat penting bagi kehidupan manusia dan
makhluk hidup lainnya. Ketersediaan air
yang cukup, berkualitas baik, dan tepat
waktu merupakan aspek krusial yang
mempengaruhi kualitas hidup. Namun,
tantangan seperti perub ahan iklim,
degradasi lingkungan, dan manajemen yang
tidak tepat dapat mengancam keters ediaan
air. Untuk mencapai kemakmuran bersama,
perlu ada kolaborasi antara masyarakat,
pemerintah, dan sektor swasta dalam
pengelolaan air. Oleh karena itu, WWF ke -
10 menjadi platform untuk membahas dan
mencari solusi terkait masalah air guna
mencapai tuju an pembangunan
berkelanjutan (The 10th World Water Forum
Secretariat, 2024b).
 WWF ke-10 berhasil menarik 64 ribu
peserta, jauh lebih banyak dibandingkan
dengan forum sebelumnya (CNBC

Indonesia, 2024). Forum ini menghasilkan
beberapa capaian penting, termasuk
Deklarasi Menteri dan para Kepala Delegasi
yang menekankan pentingnya air untuk
kesejahteraan bersama dan mengakui
berbagai proses internasional terkait air dan
pembangunan berkelanjutan. Mereka
menegaskan hak asasi manusia atas air
bersih dan sanitasi, serta pentingnya
pengelolaan air yang terintegrasi untuk
menghadapi tantangan seperti perubahan
iklim, kehilangan keanekaragaman hayati,
dan polusi. Mereka juga menggarisbawahi
perlunya kolaborasi antar pemangku
kepentingan, serta akses yang adil terhadap
layanan air dan sanitasi, terutama dalam
keadaan darurat. Selain itu, inovasi dalam
pembiayaan dan kepemimpinan politik yang
kuat dianggap krusial untuk mencapai tujuan
pembangunan berkelanjutan ter kait air.
WWF berkomitmen untuk terus berkontribusi
pada agenda global terkait air (Kementerian
Luar Negeri Republik Indonesia, 2024).
 Selain itu, Indonesia berhasil
menyusun 113 proyek strategis sumber daya
air yang nilainya mencapai 150 triliun, yang
disepakati dalam WWF. Proyek ini akan
dilakukan melalui pembiayaan bersama
negara-negara yang terlibat dalam WWF.
Proyek yang dimaksud tersebut menyangkut
penyediaan air bagi masyarakat dan
pengolahan air limbah domestik (Hasan,
2024). Forum ini juga merumuskan deklarasi
mengenai pembentukan Center of
Excellence yang bertujuan mengatasi krisis
air, serta mengusulkan pembentukan Hari
Danau Sedunia dan inisiatif untuk
meningkatkan penyediaan air bersih di
Indonesia. Para pemimpin Forum
menekankan pentingnya kolaborasi
internasional dalam melestarikan
keberlanjutan sumber daya air dan
mengelola air secara efektif untuk
keberlanjutan dan pembangunan jangka
panjang (CNBC Indonesia, 2024).

Konservasi Mangrove Sebagai Sarana
Diplomasi publik Indonesia
 Salah satu agenda dalam WWF ke -10
adalah kunjungan para pemimpin delegasi
WWF ke Area Rehabilitasi dan Konservasi
Hutan Mangrove Taman Hutan Raya Ngurah
Rai (Tahura Ngurah Rai) di Denpasar, Bali
pada 20 Mei 2024. Dalam momentum
tersebut presiden republik I ndonesia, Joko
Widodo menunjukkan keberhasilan
Indonesia dalam konservasi mangrove di
kawasan tersebut. Tahura Ngurah Rai
merupakan Kawasan Hutan Prapat Banoa,
yang ditetapkan sebagai Taman Hutan Raya
(Tahura) berdasarkan SK. Menhut No.
544/Kpts-II/1993 ta nggal 25 September
1993 (Gorda and Saputra, 2020). Kawasan
hijau tersebut memiliki area seluas 1.373,5
hektar, yang di dalamnya terdapat lebih dari
25 spesies Mangrove, termasuk 17 spesies

Mangrove sejati seperti Avicennia,
Rhizopora, dan Sonneratia. Daerah ini
sering berfungsi sebagai tempat untuk
ekowisata, kunjungan pendidikan, dan
upaya penelitian (The 10th World Water
Forum Secretariat, 2024a).
  Kawasan konservasi mangrove
Tahura Ngurah Rai berfungsi sebagai model
keberhasilan konservasi mangrove yang
efektif yang juga mengedepankan
diversifikasi usaha. Alih usaha dari budidaya
tambak ke berbagai kegiatan lain yang
memanfaatkan ekosistem mangrov e,
misalnya adalah budidaya ikan tangkap,
pengolahan produk non-kayu dari mangrove,
dan pengembangan wisata. Hal ini
menunjukkan bahwa hutan Mangrove tidak
hanya dilestarikan tetapi juga dimanfaatkan
secara berkelanjutan. Ini menciptakan
keseimbangan antar a perlindungan
lingkungan dan peningkatan ekonomi lokal.
Kawasan ini juga menerapkan prinsip Tri
Hita Karana dari ajaran Bali, yang
menekankan pentingnya keseimbangan
antara Tuhan, manusia, dan alam. Selain itu,
Tahura dilengkapi dengan area panel surya
yang berfungsi sebagai sumber pembangkit
listrik di berbagai lokasi Konservasi
Mangrove (Kemlu RI, 2024). Wilayah ini
merupakan bukti pencapaian dan dedikasi
ekonomi hijau Indonesia, yang memiliki
potensi untuk berkontribusi secara signifikan
terhadap inisiatif global yang bertujuan untuk
mengurangi tantangan lingkungan. Pada
tahun 2022, kawasan Konservasi Mangrove
di Bali mendapatkan 5.000 bibit Mangrove
dengan tujuan meningkatkan upaya
konservasi berkelanjutan, sehingga
mempercepat proses rehabilitasi Mangrove
(Muliantari, 2022).
  Dalam kunjungan delegasi WWF ke
kawasan Konservasi Mangrove, Presiden
Joko Widodo  menekankan pentingnya
konservasi hutan Mangrove dalam
penanganan perubahan iklim. Joko Widodo
juga menjelaskan bahwasanya  Konservasi
Mangrove di Bali merupakan perlindungan
bagi keanekaragaman hayati dan pusat
pendidikan ekowisata. Ia menunjukkan area
penanaman Mangrove di sepanjang muara
yang dilengkapi dengan teknologi tenaga
surya sebagai sumber energi untuk berbagai
lokasi Konservasi Mangrove sebagai bentuk
integrasi ant ara teknologi dan konservasi
lingkungan. (antaranews.com, 2024). Joko
Widodo juga memperlihatkan fasilitas
pembibitan Mangrove yang telah
dikembangkan dengan teknologi modern
dengan energi terbarukan, yang
mencerminkan upaya Indonesia dalam
keberlanjutan lingkungan dan pelestarian
alam sesuai dengan prinsip Tri Hita Karana.
Fasilitas ini diakui sebagai satu -satunya
pembibitan Mangrove modern di Indonesia.
Selain itu, Joko Widodo secara simbolis
menyerahkan bibit Mangrove kepada anak -

anak, yang mendorong mereka untuk terlibat
dalam upaya konservasi lingkungan
(Sekretariat Kabinet Republik Indonesia,
2024).
  Sama seperti hutan hujan tropis,
Mangrove turut memiliki peran penting
dalam mitigasi perubahan iklim global
karena karakteristik dan fungsi ekologisnya
yang baik. Mangrove dikenal sebagai
ekosistem “karbon biru” karena sifatnya yang
dapat menyimpan seju mlah besar karbon
dalam biomassa dan sedimen. Mangrove
bahkan dapat menyerap karbon tiga hingga
empat kali lebih banyak daripada hutan darat
(Fitria and Dwiyanoto, 2021). Hal ini
menjadikannya penting dalam mengurangi
emisi gas rumah kaca. Sebuah studi
menunjukkan bahwa ekosistem Mangrove
menyimpan rata -rata 1.083±378 mgC per
hektar, dan mampu menyerap CO2 melalui
fotosintesis (Melati, 2021). Hal ini akan
mengurangi gas rumah kaca dan dampak
perubahan iklim. Selain itu, Mangrove
melindungi pantai dari erosi dan badai, serta
mendukung beragam spesies yang menjaga
stabilitas ekologis. Mangrove juga dapat
menciptakan ekosistem yang sehat dan lebih
tahan terhadap perubahan iklim.
  Penulis berargumen bahwa ada
empat pesan penting dan tujuan yang ingin
dikomunikasikan Indonesia. Pertama,
inisiatif Joko Widodo mengajak para
delegasi WWF mengunjungi kawasan
Konservasi Mangrove merupakan langkah
komunikasi dari pemerintah yang bertujuan
menyebarkan ide dan informasi mengenai
ancaman perubahan iklim yang semakin
mendesak. Dalam konteks ini, Indonesia
bermaksud untuk menumbuhkan
pemahaman tentang pentingnya melakukan
aksi nyata untuk melawan perubahan iklim,
sebagaimana yang telah dilakukan
Indonesia dalam mengembangkan
Mangrove, serta mempraktikkan inovasi -
inovasi modern yang ramah lingkungan. Hal
ini sejalan dengan advokasi Joko  Widodo
dalam beberapa forum internasional lainnya
yang selalu menekankan aksi nyata
bersama dalam melawan perubahan iklim.
Oleh karena itu, Inisiatif Joko Widodo ini
menekankan pentingnya komitmen
komunitas internasional dalam menghadapi
tantangan lingkun gan, dan keberhasilan
Konservasi Mangrove menjadi bukti nyata
komitmen Indonesia terhadap upaya global
melawan perubahan iklim. Capaian ini
kemudian ditunjukkan kepada komunitas
internasional untuk membangun
kepercayaan global terhadap Indonesia.
  Kedua, diplomasi publik Indonesia
melalui promosi konservasi mangrove
merupakan upaya untuk mempengaruhi
opini publik dan elite negara lain untuk
menciptakan keselarasan dalam kebijakan

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.74


174
luar negeri. Perubahan iklim global adalah
ancaman nyata yang menjadi tantangan
bersama, sehingga memerlukan upaya
kolektif dari semua negara untuk
menghadapinya. Untuk itu, Indonesia
berusaha mengajak komunitas internasional
untuk menyelaraskan kebijakan mereka
dalam mencari solusi dan berpartisipasi
dalam upaya melawan perubahan iklim.
Singkatnya, Inisiatif ini berusaha
menciptakan opini publik yang
memungkinkan para delegasi WWF selaku
pemimpin atau pengambil kebijakan dapat
mengambil keputusan yang mend ukung
advokasi Indonesia dan Global dalam
mengatasi masalah lingkungan.
  Ketiga, pemerintah Indonesia
berusaha mempromosikan saling pengertian
di antara komunitas global, khususnya
delegasi WWF, bahwa meskipun Indonesia
sering dianggap berkontribusi pada
percepatan fenomena perubahan iklim —
terutama melalui peristiwa kebakaran h utan
dan deforestasi yang tinggi —penting untuk
diingat bahwa negara ini telah mencapai
kemajuan signifikan dalam mitigasi
perubahan iklim. Ini terlihat dari komitmen
Indonesia untuk mengembangkan dan
menjaga konservasi ekosistem Mangrove
serta mengadopsi inovasi ramah lingkungan
yang berkelanjutan. Persepsi inilah yang
ingin dibangun oleh pemerintah Indonesia
dalam Diplomasi publiknya di acara WWF
2024 tersebut.
  Selama ini Indonesia berkomitmen
kuat untuk mengadvokasi isu-isu lingkungan,
terutama dalam mendorong kolaborasi
komunitas internasional untuk menghadapi
tantangan perubahan iklim. Agar dapat
mempengaruhi persepsi publik, dan
meyakinkan komunitas interna sional,
Indonesia perlu memiliki posisi tawar yang
kuat atau soft power  yang signifikan untuk
mempengaruhi persepsi global. Oleh karena
itu, Indonesia berusaha membangun citra
positif yang menarik dengan menunjukkan
kepada publik bukti -bukti keberhasilannya
dalam bertindak melawan perubahan iklim,
salah satunya melalui keberhasilan
konservasi mangrove. Dalam konteks ini
Indonesia menggunakan konservasi
mangrove sebagai alat untuk melakukan
diplomasi publik, berusaha menunjukkan
komitmennya terhadap perlindu ngan
lingkungan, sambil membangun hubungan
dan kerjasama internasional. Konservasi
mangrove dalam hal ini tidak hanya
dianggap sebagai isu lingkungan, tetapi juga
sebagai cara untuk memperkuat posisi
Indonesia di mata dunia dan berkontribusi
dalam diskusi global mengenai lingkungan.
Dengan terbangunnya persepsi positif global
terhadap Indonesia, maka Indonesia akan
lebih mampu mengadvokasi isu -isu
lingkungan secara lebih efektif.

KESIMPULAN
Konservasi Mangrove memainkan peran
penting dalam Diplomasi publik Indonesia di
World Water Forum (WWF) 2024. Dengan
menggunakan Konservasi Mangrove
sebagai sarana diplomasi, Indonesia
berusaha membangun citra positif dan
meningkatkan soft power  dan posisi
tawarnya dalam diskusi global mengenai isu
lingkungan. Pemerintah juga ingin
menekankan pentingnya tindakan konkret
untuk mengatasi perubahan iklim serta
menyelaraskan kebijakan untuk menghadapi
tantangan lingkungan bersama. Selain itu,
penulis melihat ba hwa Joko Widodo
berusaha menanggapi tuduhan internasional
yang menyebut Indonesia sebagai salah
satu negara penyebab utama perubahan
iklim. Ia ingin memperlihatkan potensi
Mangrove yang dimiliki Indonesia dan
secara tidak langsung menunjukkan
kontribusi besar negara ini dalam upaya
menangani perubahan iklim.
 Penulis mengapresiasi upaya
Indonesia dalam mengadvokasi isu -isu
lingkungan, termasuk konsistensi Indonesia
dalam menyuarakan pentingnya partisipasi
semua negara dalam mewujudkan upaya
global mengatasi tantangan lingkungan.
Penulis juga mengapresiasi keak tifan
Indonesia dalam berbagai forum
internasional mengenai isu -isu lingkungan,
termasuk keberanian dan kesuksesan
Indonesia menjadi tuan rumah perhelatan
forum-forum internasional mengenai isu
lingkungan seperti WWF. Namun sejauh ini,
penulis menilai bahwa komitmen Indonesia
dalam mengatasi tantangan lingkungan
harus didukung dengan adanya regulasi dan
pengawasan yang jelas. Selain itu,
koordinasi yang baik antar para pemangku
kepentingan, pemerintah, dan masyarakat
sipil mengenai upaya bersama melawan
tantangan lingkungan, perlu untuk lebih
ditingkatkan lagi. Jika hal ini dapat dicapai,
maka posisi tawar Indonesia untuk
mengadvokasi isu -isu lingkungan akan
semakin kuat.

Abstrak

Potensi maritim Indonesia yang luas merupakan esensi penting menuju visi poros maritim dunia.
Dengan memanfaatkan posisi geografis yang strategis, Indonesia berpeluang menginisiasi
jaringan maritim yang lebih inklusif dan berkelanjutan. Penelitia n ini bertujuan untuk melihat
peluang proyeksi inisiasi penamaan koridor maritim baru sebagai sebuah instrumen diplomasi
Indonesia sebagai manifestasi Global South Bridge Builder. Hal ini dapat menjadi katalisator
dalam pertumbuhan ekonomi kawasan, mempererat solidaritas, memperkuat kerja sama
kawasan, serta memperluas pengaruh Indonesia di kancah internasional. Guna mencapai tujuan
penelitian, tulisan ini membahas mengenai potensi maritim, visi kelautan serta mekanisme kerja
sama yang dapat ditempuh Indonesia dalam mewujudkan Global South Corridor melalui AIOP.
Penelitian ini menggunakan metode kualitatif berbasi s studi kepustakaan. D engan demikian,
diharapkan Global South Corridor dapat menjadi potensi rekomendasi kebijakan yang
komprehensif dalam implementasi konektivitas maritim sebagai instrumen diplomasi maritim
Indonesia.

Kata Kunci: Kerja sama Konektivitas, Global South, Keamanan Maritim, Poros Maritim Dunia,
Diplomasi Maritim.


PENDAHULUAN
Global South telah menjadi objek analisis
yang kian menarik dalam kajian geopolitik .
Tidak hanya masivitas penggunaan
konsepnya dalam bidang akademik, namun
hal itu juga dapat diperkuat dengan berbagai
upaya-upaya diplomatik yang dilakukan oleh
berbagai negara dengan memakai Global
South guna mengatasnamakan solidaritas
negara-negara Selatan. Sebagaimana Voice
of Global Summit yang secara berkala
diselenggarakan oleh India sejak 2023
(Ministry of External Affairs of India, 2024),
atau bagaimana BRICS+ maupun G77+
China menyematkan Global South sebagai

identitas barunya. Berbagai momentum
dimana para pemimpin negara serta
organisasi internasional kerap
menggunakan terminologi Global South
dalam menyampaikan kepentingan
politiknya (Patrick, 2024). Namun, definisi
yang acap digunakan oleh sebagian besar
komunitas internasional tersebut tidak
memiliki standar baku, baik dalam klasifikasi
geografi maupun interpretasi paten yang
diyakini bersama.
Istilah Global South justru sering
mengalami reinterpretasi dalam Hubungan
Internasional guna menggambarkan negara-
negara “Dunia Ketiga”, “Berkembang”,
“Miskin”, “Terbelakang”, “Non Blok” atau
“Non Aliansi” (Dados & Connell, 2012).
Karakteristik definisi dan interpretasi konsep
Global South  yang fleksibel disebabkan
beberapa faktor, yakni tujuan penggunaan,
konteks historis, serta perkembangan global.
Definisi Global South  kemudian diartikan
sesuai dengan kepentingan spesifik dari
masing-masing pengguna ist ilah. Ragam
interpretasi yang dilakukan merujuk kepada
tujuan akhir dari penggunaan Global South,
baik dalam bentuk penentuan
wilayah/teritorial/negara maupun sebagai
penggambaran kesamaan nasib atau
ideologi.
Penggunaan istilah Global South
dalam berbagai studi juga dapat berbeda,
dalam konteks studi pembangunan
misalnya, Global South merujuk pada
negara-negara yang mengalami
keterbelakangan ekonomi dan sosial .
(Agussalim, 2019)  Namun dalam konteks
studi Hubungan Internasional, istilah ini bisa
digunakan untuk menggambarkan negara -
negara yang secara historis mengalami
kolonialisme maupun neo -kolonialisme.
Istilah Global South sendiri pertama kali
dicetuskan oleh Carl Oglesby, seorang
penulis berkebangsaan Amerika dalam
sebuah jurnal pada tahun 1969 ketika
menggambarkan perang Vietnam. Namun
penggunaan istilah yang populer pada masa
itu adalah first world untuk menggambarkan
Amerika Serikat beserta aliansi B arat,
Second World merujuk pada Uni Soviet dan
blok timur, serta Third World yang mengacu
negara berkembang atau non blok (Patrick,
2023). Penggunaan istilah Global South
kemudian meningkat popularitasnya sejak
akhir abad ke-20 sebagai alternatif dari third
world yang dianggap terlalu kaku dan
berkonotasi negatif.
Berbagai perubahan yang mengiringi
konstelasi politik internasional kemudian
meningkatkan relevansi penggunaan
konsep Global South sebagai sebuah istilah
dalam menggambarkan negara -negara
dunia ketiga yang dibelah oleh Brandt Line,
sebuah garis batas khayalan. Garis yang

ditarik berdasarkan Produk Domestik Bruto
(PDB) per kapita antara negara -negara
Utara dan Selatan sebagai bentuk visualisasi
kesenjangan internasional (Lee, 2021).
Walaupun dalam perkembangannya,
negara-negara tersebut tidak lagi selalu
dapat dikategorikan sebagai negara miskin
atau terbelakang sebagaimana definisi
awam akan third world.
Selain itu, secara geografi Global
South memiliki akurasi yang rendah, hal itu
disebabkan banyaknya negara yang disebut
“Selatan” namun seluruh wilayahnya terletak
di utara, sebagaimana India misalnya,
sementara negara yang disebut “Utara”
memiliki wilayah di belahan selatan bumi,
sebagaimana Aus tralia (Patrick, 2023).
Sehingga, penggunaan istilah Global South
lebih dominan dan tepat dalam
menginterpretasi kesamaan ide,
kepentingan, maupun nasib.
Indonesia juga turut menjadi
pengguna terminologi Global South  dalam
menyampaikan berbagai kepentingannya
pada forum -forum internasional. Frekuensi
penggunaannya semakin meningkat akhir -
akhir ini. Hal itu nampak dari beberapa
momentum peenyebutannya oleh Presiden
Indonesia, Joko Widodo, seperti di forum
G20 ketika me nyampaikan pidato
kenegaraan mengenai Spirit of Bandung
dalam merepresentasikan Global South ,
maupun dalam berbagai lawatan
kenegaraan, utamanya di negara -negara
Afrika, serta yang terbaru seper ti dalam
Indonesia-Africa Forum . Dalam forum
tersebut, Indonesia bahkan menyampaikan
4 hal utama, mulai dari pencapaian target
SDG, komitmen Indonesia untuk
berkontribusi dan menjadi bridge builder bagi
Global South ,  peningkatan kemitraan
Indonesia-Afrika dengan menghubungkan
Semangat Bandung dan Agenda Afrika
2063, serta menghidupkan kembali kerja
sama Selatan -Selatan dan Utara -Selatan
(Kementerian Luar Negeri RI, 2024).
Keempat hal utama tersebut dapat
direalisasikan melalui sebuah
keterhubungan. Keterhu bungan yang
dimaksud bukan hanya sekedar
keterhubungan melalui persamaan ide, atau
gagasan, maupun kepentingan, namun juga
terkait dengan keterhubungan mekanisme
teknis pelaksanaan kebijakan, seperti
konektivitas maritim.
Posisi geografis Indonesia yang
sangat strategis merupakan sebuah
keunggulan tersendiri. Berdasarkan pada
UNCLOS 1982, Indonesia merupakan
negara kepulauan terbesar di dunia dengan
luas wilayah laut sebesar 5,9 juta km², terdiri
atas 3,2 juta km² perairan teritorial dan 2,7
juta km² perairan Zona Ekonomi Eksklusif,
yang mana itu belum termasuk continental

shelf. Posisi Indonesia yang strategis, yang
berada di antara dua benua (Asia dan
Australia) dan dua samudera (Hindia dan
Pasifik) menjadikannya sebagai titik
pertemuan jalur pelayaran internasional
yang sangat krusial. Keunggulan ini dapat
diberdayakan sebagai sebuah instrumen
diplomasi dalam merealisasikan komitmen
dan kepentingan Indonesia, khususnya
dalam bidang maritim. Selain itu, kebijakan
konektivitas maritim juga dapat menjadi
realisasi Visi Kelautan Indonesia untuk
mewujudkan Indonesia menjadi Por os
Maritim Dunia, yang mampu memberikan
kontribusi positif tidak hanya bagi keamanan
dan perdamaian kawasan namun juga global
sesuai dengan kepentingan nasional
(Peraturan Presiden Nomor 16 Tahun 2017).
Terdapat lima pilar kebijakan maritim
Indonesia, mulai dari budaya maritim,
sumber daya maritim, infrastruktur maritim,
diplomasi maritim, serta pertahanan maritim.
Aspek-aspek seperti budaya, sumber daya,
infrastruktur dan pertahanan maritim
merupakan ton ggak utama dalam
menjalankan diplomasi maritim kompleks
yang konkrit dan tepat seperti konektivitas
maritim. Kelima indikator pilar kebijakan
maritim tersebut merupakan elemen-elemen
yang perlu diperhatikan untuk mewujudkan
Indonesia sebagai Poros Maritim Dunia.
Sebagai negara maritim, sudah seharusnya
Indonesia menjadikan laut sebagai prioritas,
aksentuasi pembangunan, dan instrumen
diplomasi, baik sebagai sebuah konsep atau
gagasan semangat kemaritiman, maupun
dalam bentuk kewilayahan/teritorial/negara.
Dengan demikian, kerja sama konektivitas
maritim merupakan prospek kerja sama
profitable baik dalam konsep ide maupun
teknis.
Kerja sama konektivitas maritim
dapat membuka peluang kerja sama
berbagai bidang lainnya, seperti
pengembangan mobilisasi kelautan,
investasi maupun transfer of technology
dalam bidang maritim, hingga pembangunan
berkelanjutan. Oleh karena itu, melalui
inisiasi Global South Corridor dapat menjadi
sebuah proposal menarik bagi diplomasi
maritim Indonesia, bukan hanya terhadap
pembangunan diversifikasi kemitraan yang
lebih setara, namun juga sebagai bentuk
komitmen Indonesia selaku Global South
bridge builder , serta sebagai bentuk nyata
implementasi visi Kelautan Indonesia
menuju Poros Maritim Dunia.
Dengan demikian, menjadi menarik
untuk dikaji  mekanisme pembentukan
Global South Corridor sebagai instrumen
diplomasi Indonesia merupakan tantangan
kompleks yang menuntut inovasi kebijakan
maritim. Bagaimana Indonesia dapat
merumuskan kerangka kerja yang tidak

hanya sekadar menghubungkan negara -
negara Selatan, tetapi juga mampu
mengatasi disparitas ekonomi, perbedaan
kepentingan geopolitik, serta dinamika
kawasan yang terus berubah? Hal tersebut
diharapkan dapat menjadi sumbangsih bagi
pengembangan kebijakan maritim Indonesia
yang lebih efektif dan berkelanjutan,
sekaligus memperkuat peran dan kontribusi
Indonesia di kawasan.

KERANGKA KONSEPTUAL
Diplomasi Maritim
Diplomasi maritim merupakan instrumen
yang semakin kompleks dan multifaset
dalam hubungan internasional. Cakupannya
melampaui interaksi antar -angkatan laut,
melibatkan berbagai aktor seperti penjaga
pantai, kapal -kapal sipil, hingga kelompok
non-negara. Aktivitas diplomasi maritim ini
sangat beragam, mulai dari bentuk kerja
sama yang bersifat konstruktif seperti
kunjungan kapal, latihan bersama, dan misi
kemanusiaan, hingga tindakan yang lebih
tegas seperti unjuk kekuatan militer dan
penerapan sanksi. Melalui diplomasi
maritim, negara -negara berusaha untuk
menjaga keamanan laut, melindungi
kepentingan nasional, mempromosikan kerja
sama regional, dan memecahkan sengketa
maritim. Dalam konteks global yang semakin
terhubung, diplomasi mar itim telah menjadi
alat yang sangat penting untuk membangun
dan memelihara hubungan bilateral maupun
multilateral (Le Mière, 2014).
Diplomasi maritim merupakan
Pelaksanaan politik luar negeri yang
bertujuan untuk mengoptimalkan potensi
kelautan guna memenuhi kepentingan
nasional sesuai dengan ketentuan nasional
dan hukum internasional (Kementerian
Koordinator Bidang Kemaritiman, 2019).  Le
Mière mengklasifikasikan diplomasi maritim
menjadi 3 kategori, cooperative diplomacy,
persuasive diplomacy, serta coercive
diplomacy. Cooperative diplomacy  atau
diplomasi kooperatif lebih condong pada
penggunaan soft power diplomacy  dalam
mengimplementasikan kebijakan. Hampir
serupa dengan cooperative diplomacy
namun berbeda dalam pendekatan,
persuasive diplomacy lebih menekankan
pada upaya negara untuk membentuk
kapasitas dalam ranah maritim. Jika
cooperative diplomacy merujuk pada kerja
sama yang meliputi join training  ataupun
penyaluran bantuan dan misi kemanusiaan,
maka persuasive diplomacy lebih merujuk
pada upaya diplomasi dengan tujuan untuk
meyakinkan suatu negara akan kapasitas
sumber daya maritim yang dimiliki atau
dikenal dengan istilah showing the flag .
Berbeda dengan kedua jenis diplomasi
sebelumnya, coercive diplomacy adalah
diplomasi yang menekankan kepada hard
power atau gunboat diplomacy, yang mana

187

lebih dominan pada pemanfaatan kekuatan
angkatan laut dengan tujuan mendesak
pihak yang berlawanan (Le Mière, 2014).
Dimensi maritim merupakan poin
utama dalam posisi dasar Indonesia untuk
melaksanakan diplomasi, mengingat hal itu
merupakan keunggulan Indonesia
berdasarkan letak geografisnya yang
strategis. Tujuan diplomasi maritim telah
mengalami pergeseran seiring dengan
perubahan situasi internasional. Jika dulu
fokus utama adalah pada kekuatan militer
untuk menjaga keamanan laut, kini
tujuannya lebih luas, mencakup aspek
keamanan, ekonomi, dan lingkungan.
Dahulu, negara -negara akan
memprioritaskan aspek antisipasi dan
deterrence melalui kekuatan militer di laut,
merujuk pada keterlibatannya di masa
perang. Pendekatan ini seringkali bersifat
konfrontatif dan kurang menekankan pada
kerja sama. Namun, dewasa ini, diplomasi
maritim cenderung berfokus pada aspek
keamanan, baik keamana n transaksi dan
distribusi laut, maupun keamanan
kewilayahan dan kedaulatan. Pendekatan ini
lebih bersifat kooperatif karena menekankan
pada kerja sama untuk mencapai tujuan
bersama. Lebih lanjut, Indonesia telah
mengusung konsep Poros Maritim Dunia,
yang memiliki makna positif mengenai
kontribusi Indonesia sebagai pasak utama
kemaritiman dunia. Dengan demikian,
konsep cooperative diplomacy dan
persuasive diplomacy  lebih tepat untuk
dilaksanakan, baik secara singular maupun
simultan. Hal tersebut disebabkan oleh
faktor-faktor penunjang dalam implementasi
Global South Corridor membutuhkan
tahapan-tahapan diplomasi yang konkrit dan
holistik. Indonesia perlu melakukan
pendekatan yang komprehensif untuk
meyakinkan negara -negara lain untuk
bergabung dalam proyek ini, sehingga
mampu meyakinkan sebagian besar negara-
negara Global South terhadap potensi
proposal kemaritiman yang hendak diusung
Indonesia.
Secara geografis, posisi laut
Indonesia sangat strategis sebagai jalur
distribusi logistik dan rantai pasok. Hal ini
memberikan Indonesia pengaruh yang
signifikan dalam perdagangan internasional
dan memungkinkan Indonesia untuk menjadi
hub logistik regiona l. Indonesia memiliki 4
dari 9 Choke Point, 1 Primary Choke Point,
yakni Selat Malaka yang merupakan salah
satu jalur utama perdagangan dunia, dan 3
Secondary Choke Point, yakni Selat Sunda,
Selat Lombok dan Selat Timor (Notteboom
et al., 2021). Selain itu , secara geopolitik,
laut Indonesia bersinggungan langsung
dengan Laut China Selatan, yang hingga kini
masih berpotensi menimbulkan konflik

Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)

188
kawasan. Sehingga dibutuhkan kecakapan
diplomasi maritim yang mumpuni guna
mengatasi persoalan tantangan yang
ditimbulkan oleh ancaman serta mengelola
potensi peluang maritim Indonesia.
Diplomasi maritim menjadi kunci bagi
Indonesia untuk menjaga keamanan laut,
melindungi kepentingan nasional, dan
memaksimalkan potensi ekonomi maritim.

Gambar 1. Jalur Pelayaran Maritim
 (Sumber : Main Maritime Shipping Routes and
Chokepoints)
Terselenggaranya diplomasi maritim
yang baik dan tepat dapat mewujudkan
berbagai tujuan dan kepentingan nasional.
Kebijakan Kelautan Indonesia (2017) secara
jelas menyebutkan bahwa diplomasi maritim
merupakan salah satu pilar penting dalam
mewujudkan Indon esia sebagai Poros
Maritim Dunia. Dari aspek pertahanan,
diplomasi maritim efektif menjaga
kedaulatan dan keutuhan wilayah melalui
berbagai perjanjian dan kesepakatan hukum
kemaritiman. Sedangkan dari aspek
keamanan, diplomasi maritim tidak hanya
penting untuk kepentingan nasional
Indonesia, tetapi juga berkontribusi pada
stabilitas keamanan di kawasan. Dengan
menjalin kerja sama dengan negara -negara
tetangga, Indonesia dapat mencegah
terjadinya konflik maritim dan menciptakan
lingkungan maritim yang aman d an stabil.
Hal tersebut menjadi penting, dikarenakan
sebagai negara maritim, mobilitas kelautan
Indonesia sangat rentan terhadap berbagai
potensi ancaman, mulai dari illegal fishing ,
terorisme, piracy, dan berbagai aktivitas
ilegal lainnya. Laporan-laporan dari berbagai
lembaga internasional seperti Interpol dan
UNODC menunjukkan tingginya tingkat
kejahatan transnasional di laut, termasuk di
wilayah perairan Indonesia. Kesemuanya
tidak hanya berdampak bagi keamanan
kawasan saja, namun juga memiliki
pengaruh signifikan terhadap kepentingan
nasional.
Dengan diplomasi maritim, Indonesia
juga dapat mewujudkan kesejahteraan
maritim. Karena dengan terselenggaranya
diplomasi, melahirkan pertahanan dan
keamanan yang baik, maka berbagai
aktivitas ekonomi kelautan seperti
pendistribusian logistik dan rantai pasok,
industri perkapalan serta pariwisata dapat
berjalan dengan baik dan terjaga. Hal lain

189

yang kemudian menyusul adalah lahirnya
proposal-proposal investasi kelautan yang
potensial bagi perkembangan kemaritiman
Indonesia. Diplomasi yang baik juga dapat
mendorong kerja sama internasional dalam
pembangunan infrastruktur maritim, seperti
pelabuhan, jalur pelayaran, dan fasilitas
pendukung lainnya. Inisiatif Belt and Road
menjadi contoh nyata bagaimana kerja sama
internasional dapat mendorong
pembangunan infrastruktur maritim di
negara-negara berkembang. Indonesia
dapat memanfaatkan inisiatif ini un tuk
menarik investasi dalam pembangunan
infrastruktur maritim dan meningkatkan
konektivitas dengan negara -negara di
kawasan Asia. Sehingga, Global South
Corridor dapat menjadi instrumen diplomasi
untuk memperluas jangkauan Indonesia
dalam bidang maritim.

Keamanan Maritim
Keamanan maritim adalah kombinasi
langkah preventif dan responsif untuk
melindungi domain maritim dari ancaman
dan potensi tindakan pelanggaran hukum.
Terdapat beberapa elemen -elemen penting
terkait keamanan maritim, seperti
keamanan dan perdamaian nasion al
maupun internasional, kedaulatan, integritas
wilayah dan kemandirian politik, keamanan
jalur komunikasi laut, perlindungan
keamanan dari kejahatan laut, keamanan
sumber daya laut, akses terhadap sumber
daya di laut dan dasar laut, perlindungan
lingkungan, serta jaminan keamanan seluruh
pelaut dan nelayan (Feldt et al., 2013).
Keamanan maritim juga dapat diartikan
sebagai upaya perlindungan wilayah maritim
dari berbagai bentuk ancaman atau tindakan
yang berpotensi merugikan suatu negara.
Ancaman terhadap keamanan maritim,
antara lain (Klein et al., 2011):
1. Pembajakan dan perampokan
bersenjata. Tindakan kriminal ini
mengancam keselamatan jiwa awak
kapal dan muatan kapal, serta
mengganggu kelancaran lalu lintas
pelayaran.
2. Terorisme. Kelompok teroris dapat
memanfaatkan laut sebagai sarana
untuk melakukan serangan atau
melarikan diri.
3. Perdagangan gelap dan
penyelundupan senjata. Kegiatan
ilegal ini dapat mengancam stabilitas
keamanan suatu negara dan
mendanai aktivitas kelompok kriminal.
4. Perdagangan gelap  dan
penyelundupan obat-obatan narkotika
dan psikotropika. Berdasarkan United
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
(UNODC) yang secara rutin memantau
tren perdagangan narkoba

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.82


190
menyatakan bahwa laut merupakan
jalur utama pendistribusiannya.
5. Perdagangan dan penyelundupan
manusia. International Labour
Organization (ILO) menyatakan
perdagangan manusia merupakan
pelanggaran HAM serius yang sering
terjadi di laut.
6. Illegal fishing. Penangkapan ikan
secara ilegal mengancam kelestarian
sumber daya ikan dan merugikan
nelayan tradisional.
7. Kerusakan yang disengaja dan tidak
sah terhadap lingkungan laut.
Kegiatan seperti pembuangan limbah
berbahaya dan tumpahan minyak
dapat merusak ekosistem laut dan
mengancam keanekaragaman hayati.
Oleh karenanya, keamanan maritim
merupakan aspek multidimensional yang
membutuhkan kerja sama dan kolaborasi
antar aktor internasional. Keamanan maritim
juga merupakan isu yang sangat kompleks
dan membutuhkan perhatian serius dari
seluruh pemangku kepentingan. Hal tersebut
dikarenakan keamanan maritim menyangkut
komponen-komponen krusial suatu bangsa,
serta berpotensi bagi hubungan antar
negara. Dalam realisasinya, keamanan
maritim membutuhkan penegakan dan
pengimplementasian hukum secara
komprehensif, kerj a sama antar negara
kawasan, serta komitmen bersama guna
tercapainya maritime confidence building
measures.
Dengan demikian, inisiasi kerja sama
konektivitas dalam bentuk implementasi
Global South Corridor dapat menjadi sebuah
upaya konkret Indonesia dalam mewujudkan
keamanan maritimnya. Proyek ini bertujuan
untuk menghubungkan negara -negara di
kawasan selatan, termasuk Indonesia,
melalui infrastruktur maritim yang baik.
Dengan adanya konektivitas yang kuat,
pengawasan terhadap aktivitas di laut
menjadi lebih mudah, sehingga dapat
mencegah terjadinya berbagai ancaman
seperti pembajakan, penyelundupan, dan
aktivitas ilegal lainnya. Proyeksi
pengaplikasian kebijakan keamanan maritim
dapat berdampak pada berbagai multisektor
secara langsung. Tidak hanya memitigasi,
atau setidaknya meminimalisir ancaman -
ancaman tersebut, namun juga
meningkatkan potensi kerja sama kela utan
yang memberikan pengaruh terhadap
pertumbuhan ekonomi nasional, regional
maupun internasional.
Global South Corridor
Menurut definisi dari bank data Kementerian
PUPR, koridor maritim merupakan jalur atau
rute yang didesain atau dirancang khusus
untuk kebutuhan terkait dengan aktivitas
kelautan, khususnya perdagangan dalam

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.82


191

konteks negara kepulauan NKRI (Badan
Pengembangan Infrastruktur Wilayah
Kementerian PUPR, 2017). Koridor maritim
adalah jalur pelayaran yang
menghubungkan berbagai wilayah,  baik
dalam skala regional maupun global. Jalur ini
berfungsi sebagai sarana transportasi utama
untuk perdagangan, pariwisata, dan aktivitas
ekonomi lainnya yang berbasis laut. Koridor
maritim seringkali dilengkapi dengan
infrastruktur pendukung seperti pelabuhan,
terminal peti kemas, dan fasilitas logistik
lainnya  (Notteboom et al., 2021).
Koridor maritim merupakan jalur
penghubung yang didukung oleh regulasi
dan kebijakan pemerintah terkait dengan
pelayaran, diplomasi maritim, keamanan
maritim serta sumber daya laut. Tujuan
pembentukan koridor maritim adalah guna
mempermudah akses antar wilayah dan arus
rantai pasok dan logistik melalui peningkatan
konektivitas. Hal tersebut berdampak
signifikan terhadap pertumbuhan ekonomi
sebagai akibat dari pengembangan investasi
di sepanjang koridor. Terdapat berbagai
contoh koridor maritim, seperti jalu r sutra
maritim yang diinisiasi China untuk
menghubungkan China dengan negara -
negara di Eropa dan Afrika, ataupun Kanal
Suez yang merupakan koridor maritim tertua
yang menghubungkan Laut Merah dan
Mediterania, atau bahkan Koridor Ekonomi
Timur Indonesia, yang merupakan inisiatif
pemerintah Indonesia untuk
mengembangkan kawasan timur Indonesia
melalui konektivitas maritim (Kementerian
Koordinator Bidang Kemaritiman dan
Investasi, 2021).
Berdasarkan Konvensi Hukum Laut
Internasional, Indonesia memiliki tiga ALKI
(Alur Laut Kepulauan Indonesia), yang mana
berdas jalur tersebut dilewati oleh lebih dari
45% total perdagangan dunia, yang
berpotensi mengalami peningkatan volume
tiap tahunnya (A dam, 2015).  Tidak hanya
penggunaan ALKI, namun keempat Choke
Point, utamanya Selat Malaka yang
merupakan Primary Choke Point  juga
memiliki tingkat mobilisasi yang sangat
tinggi. Selat malaka menghubungkan dua
Samudra besar, yakni Hindia dan Pasifik.
Diperkirakan sekitar 94,000 kapal melalui
Selat Malaka per tahunnya dengan
penggunaan lebih dari 40 pelabuhan, dan
membawa lebih dari 30% barang -barang
yang diperdagangkan secara global
(Feingold & Willige, 2024).

192

(sumber : Feingold & Willige, 2024)
Pembentukan sebuah koridor maritim
merupakan sebuah implementasi kerja sama
maritim lintas negara. Hal tersebut
dikarenakan dalam pelaksanaannya
diperlukan penggunaan infrastruktur fisik
dan non fisik maritim negara -negara yang
dilewati di sepanjang jalur koridor.  Oleh
sebab itu, dalam pembentukan koridor
maritim dibutuhkan mekanisme dip lomasi
maritim yang diinisiasi oleh negara -negara
terkait dalam mewujudkannya. Sebagai
contoh adalah pembentukan belt and road
initiative pada 2013 oleh China atau dikenal
juga sebagai jalur sutra China, yang mana
menghubungkan Asia dengan Afrika dan
Eropa dengan tujuan untuk meningkatkan
integrasi kawasan serta menstimulasi
pertumbuhan ekonomi (EBRD, 2020). Ada
pula inisiasi pembentukan koridor maritim
antar samudra, yakni Atlantik dan Pasifik,
yang diinisiasi oleh Meksiko dan diberi nama
Corridor of the Isthmus of  Tehuantepec.
Koridor ini menghubungkan berbagai
pelabuhan-pelabuhan, mulai dari Sines
Portugal hingga Coatzacoalcos Meksiko.
Tujuan pembentukan jalur tersebut guna
memperlancar alur perdagangan Meksiko
dan Uni Eropa, khususnya pada bidang
energi (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mexico,
2024). Tidak hanya itu, bahkan yang terbaru
adalah pengaktifan koridor maritim baru oleh
Uni Eropa, Siprus, UEA, Inggris serta
Amerika guna bantuan kemanusian ke Gaza
(Directorate-General for ECHO, 2024).
Kerja sama konektivitas maritim
melalui insisasi pembentukan koridor baru
merupakan alat diplomasi yang cukup efektif
dan efisien. Dengan adanya kerja sama
konektivitas maritim, negara -negara di
sepanjang jalur koridor akan bekerjasama
dalam mendorong pertumbuhan ekonomi,
membuka peluang investasi, serta
mempererat kerja sama regional dalam
berbagai bidang, mulai dari perdagangan
hingga menjamin keamanan maritim.
Penamaan koridor maritim baru
dengan menggunakan terminologi Global
South tidak hanya dapat menjadi sebuah
implementasi kerja sama konektivitas
maritim, namun juga merupakan realisasi
Spirit of Bandung dalam merepresentasikan
Global South , serta manifestasi komitmen
Indonesia dalam bentuk kontribusi nyata
sebagai Global South bridge builder. Inisiasi

Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.82


193

Global South Corridor  sebagai jalur
pelayaran baru tidak hanya dapat menjadi
instrumen diplomasi maritim Indonesia,
namun juga peluang bagi peningkatan
solidaritas negara -negara Selatan,
pengintensifan kerja sama kawasan,
perkembangan ekonomi, dan lain
sebagainya. Oleh karena itu,
pengembangan Global South Corridor
menawarkan peluang besar bagi Indonesia
untuk memperluas pengaruhnya di kawasan
dan memperkuat kemitraan strategis.
Dengan pengelolaan yang tepat, Global
South Corridor dapat menjadi katalisator
bagi pembangunan berkelanjutan dan
kesejahteraan bersama di kawasan.

HASIL DAN PEMBAHASAN
Potensi Maritim Indonesia
Sejarah kemaritiman Indonesia sudah ada
dan mengakar sejak zaman kerajaan -
kerajaan nusantara sekitar abad ke -14.
Terdapat lima zona perdagangan maritim
(maritime commercial zones ) yang
mempengaruhi dinamika pelayaran dan
perkembangan negara -negara di kawasan
Asia, yakni Teluk Bengal, Selat Malaka, Laut
China Selatan, Laut Sulu, dan Laut Jawa
(Hall, 2019). Mobilisasi maritim Indonesia
telah lahir dan mendarah daging sejak lama.
Tidak hanya sebagai jalur perdagangan,
namun juga sebagai kekayaan kultural yang
ditandai dengan banyaknya suku -suku laut
di Indonesia. Pada beberapa karya etnografi
juga sering disebut dengan suku laut atau
sea nomads, sea folk, sea hunters and
gatherers atau cho lai/chaw talay . Seperti
suku Bajo dan Suku Bugis. Suku Bajo yang
dipercaya sebagai bagian dari armada laut

Kerajaan Sriwijaya, suku Bajo juga dikenal
sebagai penyelam ulung yang memiliki
hubungan yang sangat erat dengan laut.
Mereka memiliki pengetahuan mendalam
tentang ekosistem laut dan mampu
beradaptasi dengan kehidupan di bawah air,
serta banyak tersebar di berbagai daerah di
Indonesia dan berasimilasi dengan
penduduk asli. Selain itu, ada pula suku
Bugis yang terkenal sebagai pelaut dan
pedagang handal lintas laut sejak masa
kolonial  (Setyawan, 2019).
Indonesia memiliki luas perairan
pedalaman dan perairan kepulauan adalah
3.110.000 km 2 dengan luas laut teritorial
Indonesia adalah 290.000 km 2, luas zona
tambahan Indonesia adalah 270.000 km 2,
luas zona ekonomi eksklusif Indonesia
adalah 3.000.000 km2, luas landas kontinen
Indonesia adalah 2.800.000 km 2, luas total
perairan Indonesia adalah 6.400.000 km 2,
luas NKRI keseluruhan adalah 8.300.000
km2, panjang garis pantai Indonesia adalah
108.000 km, dengan jumlah pulau di
Indonesia kurang lebih 17.504, dan yang
sudah dibakukan dan diverifikasi ke PBB
adalah sejumlah 16.056 pulau (Kementerian
Koordinator Kemaritiman dan Investasi et al.,
2018).
Keunggulan geografi Indonesia
dengan berbagai kekayaan alam yang
dimiliki merupakan potensi maritim yang
integral. Bahkan potensi tersebut bersifat
eksesif dan mampu melahirkan berbagai
potensi multisektor lainnya. Pada potensi
sumber daya alam laut Indonesia misalnya,
keanekaragaman hayati laut indonesia
tergolong sangat tinggi. Indikator produksi
perikanan, baik perikanan tangkap dan
perikanan budidaya, memiliki capaian
hingga 24.74 juta ton pada 2023. Hal itu
menyumbang setidaknya 5.49%
pertumbuhan PDB perikanan (Pusat Data,
Statistik dan Informasi Kementerian
Kelautan dan Perikanan, 2024).

Selain itu, banyaknya cekungan
sedimen di wilayah Indonesia yang
menyimpan cadangan minyak dan gas bumi
yang cukup besar . Hal itu juga merupakan
salah satu sumber devisa negara yang
potensial. Sejak 2016, cadangan terbukti
minyak bumi berada di angka 3,602.53
MMSTB, sedangkan cadangan potensial di
angka 3,702.49 MMSTB, dan masih
berpotensi meningkat jika eksplorasi

dilakukan secara masif. Tidak hanya minyak
dan gas bumi, sumber daya mineral
Indonesia juga sangat melimpah. Beberapa
cadangan mineral dan bahan tambang
ditemukan baru-baru ini dalam jumlah besar
di perairan Utara Sulawesi dan Maluku
(Kementerian ESDM RI , 2016). Potensi
kelautan Indonesia yang beragam, tidak
hanya dapat menguntungkan negara secara
umum, namun bahkan dapat menjadi sarana
menuju kesejahteraan bagi seluruh
rakyatnya secara khusus.
Laut Indonesia juga memiliki potensi
bagi pengembangan energi terbarukan.
Pada kandungan komponen yang dimiliki air
laut saja, dapat dimanfaatkan sebagai
elektrolit pada sel baterai sebagai
pembangkit tenaga listrik. Semakin banyak
air laut, maka tegangan yang dihasilkan
semakin besar. Selain kandungannya, suhu
air laut juga merupakan potensi energi yang
besar. Energi dari suhu air laut dihasilkan
dari radiasi oleh matahari dan magma dasar
laut Indonesia. Sehingga rata -rata suhu
permukaan laut di Indonesia berkisar 25 ℃
sampai dengan 300 ℃ tergantung pada
lamanya reaksi yang terjadi antara matahari
dan magma dasar laut tersebut. Tidak
sampai di situ, arus serta gelombang air laut
juga menjadi aspek penting dalam
pengembangan energi terbarukan. Arus laut
dapat menghasilkan energi kinetik dar i
kecepatan yang dihasilkan, yang dapat
bermanfaat untuk rotor atau turbin guna
produksi listrik, serta jenis gelombangnya
baik pergerakan horizontal maupun vertikal
juga dapat dimanfaatkan sebagai energi
momentum pengganti f osil (Rahmawati et
al., 2022). Laut Indonesia memiliki potensi
energi sebesar 17,9 GW, namun hanya
sedikit yang dimanfaatkan. Jika Indonesia
secara serius memanfaatkan lautnya, yang
mana jika dibandingkan dengan pembangkit
listrik Jawa-Bali potensi energi laut Indonesia
adalah 53,3%, yang mana angka tersebut
hanya berfokus pada pengembangan energi
terbarukan saja, dapat dibayangkan berapa
banyak daerah di Indonesia yang teraliri
listrik dan krisis energi nasional dapat
terselesaikan (Sanam et al., 2022).

Pasang Surut dan OTEC

Tidak hanya sumber daya alam laut
Indonesia, yang kesemuanya mampu
menghasilkan potensi multibidang yang
estafet. Potensi ekonomi maritim Indonesia

Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.82


196
juga muncul dari transportasi laut, pariwisata
bahari serta pengembangan obat -obatan
dan bahan kimia melalui bioteknologi laut.
Potensi maritim Indonesia yang variatif dan
dalam jumlah yang masif merupakan
anugerah Tuhan bagi bangsa. Dengan
pengelolaan dan pemanfaatannya yang
tepat dapat berdampak langsung tidak
hanya bagi masyarakat pesisir, namun bagi
keseluruhan warga negara Indonesia.
Visi Kelautan Indonesia
Indonesia memiliki visi kelautan untuk
menjadi sebuah negara maritim yang
berdaulat, maju, mandiri, kuat, serta mampu
memberikan kontribusi positif bagi
keamanan dan perdamaian kawasan dan
dunia sesuai dengan kepentingan
nasionalnya. Indonesia melalui Kemenko
Maritim telah menerbitkan Kebijakan
Kelautan Indonesia menuju poros maritim
dunia. Kebijakan Kelautan Indonesia diatur
dalam UU no. 17 tahun 2017 tentang RPJP,
UU no 32 tahun 2024 tentang kelautan, serta
Nawacita dengan prinsip kebijakan wawasan
nusantara, pembangunan berkelanjutan,
ekonomi baru, pengelolaan terintegrasi dan
transparan, partisipasi, serta pemerataan
dan kesetaraan. Terdapat tujuh pilar
kebijakan dalam peta jalan Kebijakan
Kelautan tersebut, yaitu (Kementerian
Koordinator Bidang kemaritiman Republik
Indonesia, 2017):
1. Pengelolaan sumber daya kelautan
dan pegembangan sumber daya
manusia. Pilar ini fokus pada
pengelolaan sumber daya laut secara
bijaksana, baik itu sumber daya hayati
maupun non -hayati, serta
pengembangan kapasitas sumber
daya manusia yang kompeten di
bidang kelautan. Mengoptimalkan
pemanfaatan sumber daya laut secara
berkelanjutan, mengembangkan
perikanan tangkap dan budidaya, serta
meningkatkan nilai tambah produk
perikanan.
2. Pertahanan, keamanan, penegakan
hukum dan keselamatan di laut.  Pilar
ini bertujuan untuk menjaga
kedaulatan negara di wilayah laut,
mencegah ancaman dari luar, dan
memastikan keamanan bagi aktivitas
maritim. Memperkuat keamanan dan
keselamatan pelayaran, mencegah
illegal, unreported, and unregulated
fishing (IUU fishing), serta melindungi
wilayah laut Indonesia.
3. Tata kelola dan kelembagaan di laut.
Pilar ini fokus pada penyempurnaan
sistem tata kelola kelautan, baik di
tingkat pusat maupun daerah, serta
membangun sinergi antar lembaga
terkait. Memperkuat kelembagaan
kelautan, menyusun regulasi yang

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.82


197

efektif, dan meningkatkan transparansi
dalam pengelolaan sumber daya laut.
4. Ekonomi, infrastruktur, dan
peningkatan kesejahteraan. Pilar ini
bertujuan untuk mendorong
pertumbuhan ekonomi berbasis
kelautan, menciptakan lapangan kerja,
dan mengurangi kesenjangan antara
daerah pesisir dan daratan.
Mengembangkan infrastruktur maritim,
mendorong investasi di sektor
kelautan, dan meningkatk an
kesejahteraan masyarakat pesisir.
5. Pengelolaan ruang laut dan
perlindungan lingkungan laut.  Pilar ini
bertujuan untuk menjaga kelestarian
lingkungan laut dan memastikan
pemanfaatan sumber daya laut secara
berkelanjutan. Melakukan zonasi
ruang laut, mencegah pencemaran
laut, dan melindungi keanekaragaman
hayati laut.
6. Budaya bahari. Pilar ini bertujuan
untuk menumbuhkan rasa cinta
terhadap laut dan mendorong
masyarakat untuk terlibat aktif dalam
menjaga kelestarian lingkungan laut.
Membangun kesadaran masyarakat
akan pentingnya laut, melestarikan
budaya maritim, dan mengembangkan
pariwisata bahari.
7. Diplomasi maritim.  Pilar ini bertujuan
untuk memperkuat posisi Indonesia di
kancah internasional, menjalin kerja
sama dengan negara-negara lain, dan
mengatasi berbagai tantangan di
bidang kelautan. Memperkuat kerja
sama bilateral dan multilateral di
bidang kelautan, menyelesaikan
sengketa maritim secara damai, dan
meningkatkan peran Indo nesia dalam
forum internasional.
Seluruh pilar tersebut diturunkan
kembali menjadi 76 kebijakan utama sebagai
strategi dalam mencapai tujuan menjadikan
Indonesia sebagai Poros Maritim Dunia. 9
strategi pengembangan sumber daya
kelautan, 12 strategi pengembangan sumber
daya manusia, 8 stra tegi pertahanan,
keamanan, penegakan hukum dan
keselamatan di laut, 3 strategi tata kelola dan
kelembagaan di laut, 8 strategi ekonomi
kelautan, 7 strategi infrastruktur kelautan, 5
strategi peningkatan kesejahteraan, 6
strategi pengelolaan ruang laut, 6 s trategi
perlindungan lingkungan laut, 5 strategi
budaya bahari serta 7 strategi diplomasi
maritim. Kerja sama konektivitas maritim
merupakan kerjasama holistik, hal tersebut
dikarenakan konektivitas maritim tidak hanya
mampu melaksanakan 1 pilar kebijakan saja,
namun juga 4 pilar utama sekaligus sebagai
dasar pelaksanaannya, sebagai sebuah
strategi pertahanan, keamanan, dan
keselamatan laut, tata kelola dan

Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.82


198
kelembagaan laut, ekonomi, infrastruktur,
dan peningkatan kesejahteraan, serta
diplomasi maritim. Pengimplementasian
kebijakan maritim yang tepat dan sungguh -
sungguh maka dapat memberi dampak bagi
pilar kebijakan kelautan lainnya.

Proyeksi Global South
Terminologi Global South  telah mengalami
pergeseran makna dalam beberapa dekade
ini. Global South dahulu merupakan istilah
bagi negara -negara berkembang yang
didominasi di wilayah selatan bumi, namun
perubahan sistem internasional menjadi
multipolar menyebabkan kontribusi negara -
negara tersebut meningkat dan berdampak
pesat terhadap kesejahteraan globa l pada
umumnya. Jika melihat akhir abad ke -19
hingga kini terjadi perubahan signifikan
bukan hanya terhadap sistem internasional
secara menyeluruh, namun juga  kontribusi
negara-negara berkembang dalam
perdagangan maupun produksi global, dan
pangsa negara -negara selatan yang
meningkat pesat sejak 1980 -an.
Pertumbuhan perdagangan dunia secara riil
meningkat hingga lebih dari 6%, dengan
kontribusi negara-negara Selatan mencapai
sekitar 50% sejak tahun 2000 -an. Beragam
hal melatarbelakangi pertumbuhan tersebut,
mulai dari peningkatan ekspor negara -
negara Selatan dengan rata -rata tahunan
sebesar 13% sejak 1995 hingga 2016
dengan nilai perdagangan yang melonjak
dari $0.6 triliun pada 1995 menjadi $4 triliun
pada 2016, yang mana jumlah tersebut
melampaui total ekspor global yang hanya
sebesar 8%. Tidak hanya itu, terdapat
seperempat atau 25% dari total
perdagangan dunia terjadi di negara-negara
Selatan (UNCTAD, 2018).

Gambar 5. Tingkat pertumbuhan tahunan
(annual growth) perdagangan dan produksi
global (dalam persen).
(Sumber: UNCTAD, 2018)

Pengaruh Global South semakin
meningkat tidak hanya pada aspek ekonomi
semata, namun juga merambat pada politik
hingga militer. Global South  kemudian
menjadi sebutan dalam menggambarkan
solidaritas negara -negara Selatan dengan
cukup inheren dalam Hubungan
Internasional. Hal itu terlihat dalam berbagai
forum internasional yang dipertunjukkan oleh
negara-negara yang terasosiasi sebagai
Global South dalam bentuk dukungannya

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.82


199

terhadap kepentingan internasional tertentu,
seperti pada pemungutan suara di majelis
umum PBB, atau keikutsertaan dalam
Chinese Development Initiative , atau
partisipasi dalam Africa Summit  yang
diselenggarakan oleh Rusia pada 2023 lalu
(Klingebiel, 2023).
Peranan yang dimainkan tersebut
menjadikan Global South memiliki
dampaknya terhadap konstelasi geopolitik
dan geoekonomi menjadi signifikan. Dalam
konflik kawasan misalnya, aktor-aktor Global
South tidak lagi hanya menjadi penonton,
namun telah menjadi co-player aktif yang
dukungannya diperebutkan para pihak
melalui berbagai kerja sama pertahanan dan
keamanan. Atau dalam rivalitas ekonomi,
negara-negara Selatan menjadi target utama
dalam kerja sama ekonomi, peningkatan
ekspor-impor, pasar modal serta invest asi,
dan lain sebagainya.
Global South menjadi sebuah simbol
bagi negara -negara dalam membebaskan
diri dari berbagai afiliasi politik. Hal tersebut
nampak jelas jika melihat bagaimana respon
negara-negara Selatan terhadap kampanye
Barat untuk mengucilkan Rusia lewat
kebijakan isolasi dan embar go sebagai
bentuk aksi penolakan terhadap agresi
militernya di Ukraina. Namun, aktor -aktor
Global South  seakan sepakat untuk tidak
mendukung aliansi politik manapun dan
memilih untuk non-alignment sebagai prinsip
dari tindakan politik internasional yang
diambil.
Pada dasarnya prinsip tersebut
sesuai dengan asas non -blok yang
digaungkan Presiden Soekarno sebagai
bentuk respon terhadap hegemoni bipolar
pada masa Perang Dingin. Global South
memiliki spirit non -blok dengan prinsip
“kepemimpinan tanpa hegemoni”
sebagaimana yang diserukan Indonesia
dalam sidang majelis umum PBB ke 79.
Kepemimpinan tanpa hegemoni dengan
prioritas utamanya adalah memajukan
perdamaian, memastikan masa depan
berketahanan untuk kesejahteraan
bersama, serta membangun jembatan guna
kolaborasi g lobal (Kemlu RI, 2024).
Pernyataan Presiden RI dalam pembukaan
Forum Indonesia -Afrika ( Indonesia-Africa
Forum/IAF) tentang Global South turut
menjadi elemen kunci dalam prospek
diplomasi Indonesia ke depan. Ajakan
solidaritas yang diutarakan merupakan
deklarasi tekad Indonesia untuk
berkontribusi sebagai penggerak perubahan
di tengah dunia yang penuh tantangan
(Kementerian Luar Negeri RI, 2024).
Sebagai respon dalam menghadapi
berbagai tantangan global melalui
pemanfaatan keunggulan Indonesia sebagai
negara maritim, serta upaya untuk menuju

Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)

Poros Maritim Dunia, kerja sama
konektivitas maritim adalah reaksi yang tepat
dalam diplomasi Indonesia. Selain itu, kerja
sama konektivitas maritim merupakan wujud
manifestasi komitmen Indonesia untuk
berkontribusi dalam membela kepentingan
Global South sesuai dengan agenda politik
luar negerinya.

Global South Corridor sebagai kerja sama
Konektivitas Maritim
Indonesia memiliki peran strategis dalam
kerja sama maritim baik di tingkat regional
maupun global. Potensi maritim yang besar
telah mendorong Indonesia untuk aktif
terlibat dalam berbagai inisiatif dan forum
kerja sama maritim. Keikutsertaan Indonesia
dalam kerja sama ini sejalan dengan
kapasitas geopolitik yang dimilikinya sebagai
negara maritim dengan garis pantai yang
panjang dan kekayaan sumber daya laut
yang melimpah.
Untuk menilai kapasitas geopolitik
suatu negara, termasuk Indonesia, terdapat
tiga dimensi utama yang perlu diperhatikan.
Pertama, geografi fisik yang mencakup
aspek seperti kualitas infrastruktur,
kerawanan ekologis, dan keamanan energi.
Indikator-indikator ini mencerminkan kondisi
dasar suatu negara dalam memanfaatkan
potensi maritimnya. Kualitas infrastruktur
yang memadai, misalnya, sangat penting
untuk mendukung aktivitas ekonomi maritim
dan konektivitas antar pulau. Sementara itu,
kerawanan ekologis da n keamanan energi
berkaitan dengan keberlanjutan
pemanfaatan sumber daya laut dan
ketahanan negara terhadap gangguan
pasokan energi (Widjajanto, 2022).
Adapun kapasitas geografi insani
dihitung dari indeks perdamaian, PDB per
kapita, indeks pembangunan manusia,
indeks persepsi anti korupsi, indeks
kerawanan pangan, dan indeks demokrasi.
Sedangkan skor kapasitas instrumen
geografi diukur dari proporsi anggaran
pertahanan, indeks keamanan siber dan
kendali penginderaan satelit. Hasil
komparasi skor kapasitas geopolitik
tersebutlah yang menjadi dasar posisi
Indonesia dalam sistem internasional. Jika
dinilai berdasarkan indeks kapasitas
geopolitik, secara agregat Indonesia masih
di posisi sedang. Terdapat beberapa
indikator yang perlu diperbaiki dalam
peningkatan kualitas kapasitas geopolitik
Indonesia, mulai dari mendorong
pembangunan berkelanjutan guna
peningkatan kapasitas ekologi dan kualitas
sumber daya ke hidupan manusia,
peningkatan taraf hidup masyarakat serta
kematangan institusional pemerintah, serta
peningkatan kemampuan relatif pertahanan
dan keamanan di semua matra, khususnya

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)

201

dalam penguasaan teknologi (Widjajanto,
2022).

Gambar 6. Indeks Kapasitas Geopolitik Global.
(Sumber: Widjajanto, 2022)

Namun, kapasitas geopolitik pun
dapat dinilai dari usulan gagasan atau ide
atau norma kerja sama internasional yang
diusung. Indonesia memiliki karakter penting
sebagai aset utama yang harus dimiliki
sebuah negara untuk menjadi Poros Maritim
Dunia, yaitu k edudukan geografis. Posisi
geostrategis Indonesia ditentukan oleh tiga
alur laut kepulauan (ALKI) serta lima wilayah
choke points . Hal tersebut merupakan
tantangan bagi geopolitik Indonesia.
Berbagai ancaman berpotensi melintasi jalur
pelayaran tersebut, mulai dari perompakan,
penyelundupan barang bahkan senjata,
penyelundupan manusia, perbudakan di
laut, pencurian dan pengrusakan sumber
daya kelautan, serta ancaman pertahanan
seperti kapal selam asing dan sebagainya.
Ancaman-ancaman tersebut
menuntut Indonesia untuk selalu melakukan
reformasi dan renovasi strategi kebijakan
kelautan, khususnya dalam bidang
pertahanan dan keamanan maritim. Selain
itu, komitmen Indonesia dalam
meningkatkan kapasitas maritimnya dapat
dilihat dari berbagai peningkatan serta kerja
sama maritim yang dilakuk an. Dengan
komitmen, keunggulan geografis serta
peluang aspek aset maritim yang potensial,
Indonesia dapat menawarkan sebuah
proposal kerja sama internasional sebagai
bentuk procedure for request assistance
dalam mekanisme diplomasi, yang jika
dikembangkan lebih lanjut dapat
direalisasikan menjadi capacity building .
Efektifitas pengimplementasiannya
tergantung pada pengelolaan kerja sama
dan komitmen negara-negara.
Penetapan tujuh pilar kebijakan
dalam peta jalan Kebijakan Kelautan
Indonesia membutuhkan implementasi yang
integral dan komprehensif. Kerja sama
konektivitas maritim merupakan proposal
kerja sama yang holistik, yang mencakup
empat dari tujuh pilar kebijakan tersebut.
Konektivitas maritim merupakan integrasi
infrastruktur maritim yang didukung oleh
penguatan transportasi laut. Oleh sebab itu,
dalam pembangunan konektivitas,
peningkatan dan pengelolaan infrastruktur
maritim baik fisik, (industri perkapalan,
logistik, port area , shipping connectivity )

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)

202
maupun non -fisik (regulasi dan hukum,
kelembagaan dan tata kelola kelautan)
menjadi sebuah prioritas. Namun,
pergolakan geopolitik yang tidak menentu
menjadi sebuah tantangan tersendiri yang
menuntut Indonesia untuk memacu relevansi
kebijakan maritimnya da lam merespon
sesuai dengan visi kebijakan kelautan yang
telah disusun.
Posisi Indonesia dengan tiga ALKI
serta 4 choke points  yang dimiliki menjadi
peluang untuk mengembangkan kerja sama
konektivitas maritim, utamanya yang
terintegrasi dengan negara -negara Selatan.
Indonesia dapat mengajukan inisiasi guna
mekanisme kerja sama konektivitas maritim
melalui ASEAN Outlook on the Indo -Pacific
(AOIP). Hal tersebut dikarenakan AOIP
merupakan salah satu dari tiga pilar
keketuaan Indonesia bersama ASEAN
Matters dan Epicentrum of Growth.  Selain
itu, maritim merupakan salah satu bidang
prioritas AOIP selain ekonomi, konektivitas
dan pencapaian Tujuan Pembangunan
Berkelanjutan (SDGs) (Kementerian
Sekretariat Negara Republik Indonesia,
2023). Melalui kerja sama konektivitas
maritim dalam bentuk inisiasi Global South
Corridor, hampir keseluruhan prioritas AOIP
terjawab secara efisien dalam satu kerangka
kerja sama.
AOIP juga memiliki tujuan yang
seragam dengan proposal pembentukan
koridor maritim yakni bertujuan memperkuat
arsitektur regional yang inklusif.  AOIP
dimaksudkan sebagai panduan bagi
keterlibatan ASEAN di kawasan Asia-Pasifik
dan Samudra Hindia (Kominfo, 2023).
Sistem konektivitas ini akan
mengintegrasikan ketiga ALKI beserta
seluruh choke points  juga berbagai jalur
internasional dan nasional negara lainnya
yang terkoneksi, yang dikenal sebagai
Global South Corridor . Penamaan koridor
baru berbotensi memiliki dampak terhadap
politik maritim global. Hal itu menunjukkan
manifestasi solidaritas yang nyata melalui
konektivitas maritim lewat inisiasi koridor
baru.
Mekanisme kerangka kerja sama
konektivitas Global South Corridor ini juga
diharapkan menganut prinsip dasar yang
diyakini dalam AOIP, yakni mengutamakan
solidaritas yang berdasarkan kolaborasi
daripada kompetisi. Selain itu, koridor ini
juga mengupayakan penanganan tata kelola
dan kelembagaan laut bersama untuk jalur -
jalur internasional guna menjamin keamanan
dan keselamatan di laut. Tidak hanya itu,
kerja sama ini mengupayakan terwujudnya
green and digital corridor melalui kerja sama
infrastruktur dan kesejahteraan maritim.
Kesemua prinsip -prinsip tersebut juga

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.82


203

merupakan poin-poin penting yang terdapat
pada pilar utama kebijakan kelautan
Indonesia.

Gambar 7. Koridor Perdagangan Utama
(Ascensao et al., 2018)

Global South Corridor juga dapat
diproyeksikan menjadi jalur integrasi
berbagai negara -negara di dunia, tidak
hanya negara -negara Selatan seperti
negara-negara Asia dan Afrika, namun juga
Amerika, Eropa, dan Australia. Hal tersebut
dikarenakan jalur ini tidak hanya potensial
terhadap ancaman, namun juga terhadap
peluang. Mobilisasi maritim serta distribusi
logistik dan rantai pasok, tak pernah surut
melintasi jalur koridor ini. Di lain sisi, secara
geografis, penguasaan laut dunia sebagian
besarnya dimiliki oleh negara -negara
Selatan. Tidak hanya itu, sebagian besar
jalur sutra abad ke -21 berada di wilayah
Selatan bumi. Hal itu jelas menjadi aspek
keunggulan bagi Global South. Kerja sama
konektivitas ini juga tidak hanya menjamin
integrasi maritim antar negara -negara
Selatan saja, namun juga keamanan logistik
dan rantai pasok pelintas legal, serta
pembangunan infrastruktur maritim,
khususnya subsektor fisik. Kesemuanya
dapat diatur sesuai dengan kepentingan dari
masing-masing pihak berdasarkan
“kepemimpinan tanpa hegemoni” yang dapat
menjamin kesejahteraan dan pembangunan
kapasitas maritim bersama.

KESIMPULAN
Terdapat banyak kerja sama maritim yang
telah digalangkan, namun sejauh ini, belum
ada pengaruhnya terhadap peningkatan
upaya Indonesia untuk menjadi Poros
Maritim dunia, bahkan untuk sebuah afirmasi
pun nampak masih nihil. Global South
Corridor merupakan perwujudan awal
langkah konkrit Indonesia dalam mencapai
targetnya menuju Poros Maritim Dunia.
Indonesia memang memiliki keunggulan
geografi dan pantas melabeli diri sebagai
negara maritim, namun kualitas kemaritiman
kita masih butuh banyak perb aikan untuk
mencapai dan merealisasikan visi Indonesia
sebagai Poros Maritim Dunia. Spirit
Indonesia dalam berkontribusi bagi dunia
telah teruji dari berbagai forum dan aksi
internasionalnya. Namun, disebabkan masih
minimnya kapasitas geopolitik menjadikan
pengaruh yang dihasilkan tidak begitu
berdampak terhadap aktor -aktor
internasional lainnya. Hal t ersebut juga

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)

204
menjadi catatan penting dalam bidang
maritim Indonesia.
Perpaduan antara semangat untuk
berkontribusi serta visi Poros Maritim Dunia
Indonesia, dapat dimanifestasikan dalam
Kebijakan Kelautan melalui strategi inisiasi
Global South Corridor . Penggunaan istilah
Global South dalam sebuah gagasan kerja
sama bukannya bebas dari berbagai
implikasi maupun kritik. Hal tersebut
dikarenakan konsep yang kaya dan
kompleks tersebut memiliki fleksibilitas
definisi yang memungkinkannya untuk selalu
menjadi subjek perdebatan akademis.
Namun, nilai yang terkandung dalam istilah
tersebut dapat merangkum berbagai
gagasan yang hendak diusung oleh
Indonesia, mulai dari penekanan terhadap
kesamaan pengalaman, baik historis, sosial,
serta ekonomi, maupun penegasan terhadap
sikap anti kolonialisme. Tidak hanya itu,
“Global South” juga merupakan pengakuan
atas keberagaman dengan karakteristik,
dengan asumsi bahwa negara -negara
tersebut memiliki kuasa dan kemampuan
penuh untuk menentukan nasib mereka,
khususnya di bidang maritim, lewat
peningkatan kolaborasi dan kerja sama. Hal
tersebut mewakili esensi non -blok serta
menghindari pandangan paternalistik yang
seringkali disematkan terhadap negara -
negara Selatan. Lahirnya penamaan koridor
maritim bar u memiliki dampak terhadap
solidaritas kawasan yang mampu
meningkatkan sense of belonging antar
negara-negara Selatan. Proyeksi kerja sama
ini juga dapat memicu peningkatan maritime
confidence and security building measures di
kawasan.
Indonesia telah memiliki peta jalan
Kebijakan Kelautan yang menyeluruh untuk
diimplementasikan. Dengan memperbaiki
pengelolaan sumber daya kelautan dan
pegembangan sumber daya manusia,
peningkatan pertahanan, keamanan,
menjamin mobilisasi rantai pasok dan
logistik, penataan regulasi maritim dan
penegakan hukum dan keselamatan di laut,
perbaikan dan penyempurnaan tata kelola
dan kelembagaan di laut, ruang laut,
pembangunan ekonomi, infrastruktur,
pemberdayaan subsektor fisik juga non-fisik,
dan peningkatan kesejahteraan, serta
budaya bahari. Dengan pengelolaan
berbagai aspek kemaritiman yang baik dan
tepat, kapasitas geopolitik akan meningkat
dan diplomasi maritim semakin mudah untuk
direalisasikan.

Abstract

Merespons isu kualitas udara di DKI Jakarta dengan t ingkat polusi udara yang tinggi, Pemprov
DKI Jakarta bersama dengan Cities 40, mengeluarkan kebijakan lingkungan baru bernama Low
Emission Zone (LEZ) yang diterapkan di area Kota Tua dan Tebet Eco Park. P enelitian ini
bertujuan untuk menjelaskan bagaimana implementasi Low Emission Zone (LEZ) dan kaitan
paradiplomasi Pemprov DKI Jakarta dengan C40. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode kualitatif
deskriptif dengan wawancara dan studi literatur sebagai teknik pengambilan data. Penelitian ini
menggunakan konsep organisasi internasional dan teor i paradiplomasi. Hasil dari penelitian ini
memperlihatkan kerja sama yang diimplementasikan antara Pemprov DKI Jakarta dan Cities 40
meliputi pemberian bantuan teknis, bantuan dana, dan bantuan teknologi. Namun, implementasi
Low Emission Zone (LEZ) nyatanya merupakan langkah awal yang masih terbatas, sehingga
masih memerlukan strategi yang lebih komprehensif untuk mencapai hasil yang ditargetkan.
Kata Kunci: Low Emission Zone, C40, paradiplomasi Jakarta.

PENDAHULUAN
Perubahan iklim merupakan isu non -
tradisional yang muncul sebagai respon atas
kerusakan lingkungan yang memengaruhi
pola cuaca dalam waktu yang
berkepanjangan. Perserikatan Bangsa -
Bangsa dalam salah satu artikelnya
menyatakan bahwa tahun 1800 menjadi
awal dimana aktivitas manusia menjadi salah
satu alasan terjadinya perubahan iklim yang
berarti perubahan ini tidak terjadi secara
natural (Perserikatan Bangsa -Bangsa,
2023).
Banyak alasan mengapa aktivitas
manusia menjadi salah satu alasan terbesar
terjadinya perubahan iklim, beberapa di
antaranya merupakan efek rumah kaca,
salah satu faktor terjadinya perubahan iklim
dikarenakan banyaknya gas-gas di atmosfer
yang menahan radi asi matahari keluar dari

bumi. Selain itu terjadi juga penipisan lapisan
ozon, yang disebabkan adanya karbon yang
disebut chlorofluorocarbons atau CFC yang
merusak lapisan ozon (Fadliah, 2008).
Dalam situasi ini, posisi Indonesia
yang terkenal dengan lahan hijau luas
bahkan disebut sebagai “paru -paru dunia”,
menjadikannya sebagai negara yang
memahami urgensi pentingnya menjaga
lahan hijau Indonesia demi menjaga
keberlangsungan hidup masyarakat.
Namun, berbanding terbalik dengan kata
penjagaan, marak terdengar berita
mengenai deforestasi hutan. Sudah banyak
lahan hijau yang nyatanya dikomersilkan
baik itu oleh pemerintah maupun
perusahaan multinastional atau multinational
corporations (MNCs), yang menyebabkan
terjadinya penebangan atau deforestasi
hutan dalam lingkup yang cukup bahkan
sangat besar. Tentu ini menimbulkan
polemik dan masalah baru, baik kepada
masyarakat setempat dan endemik yang
tinggal di wilayah tersebut namun juga
kepada kualitas lingkungan Indonesia. Data
mencatatat bahwa deforestasi hutan
nyatanya sudah menjadi isu bagi Indonesia
sejak tahun 1970, dibalik pemahaman atas
pentingnya peran hutan bagi lingkungan
(Fadliah, 2008).
Hal inipun meninggalkan efek negatif
tersendiri bagi Indonesia, khususnya dalam
hal kualitas udara. Dalam salah satu
rekapitulasi laporan dari tahun 2018 -2020
mengenai kualitas udara negara yang
dikeluarkan oleh IQAir, ada 7 (tujuh)
tingkatan kualitas udara, yaitu tingkat 1
merupakan tingkatan yang memenuhi
standar WHO dan tingkat 7 s ebagai
peringkat terburuk  (IQAir, 2024). Dari ke
tujuh tingkat, sepanjang tahun 2018 -2020,
Indonesia meraih tingkat 5 dan tingkat 7
yang merupakan tingkat terburuk.
Berbanding lurus dengan minimnya Ruang
Terbuka Hijau (RTH) di Indonesia yang
dapat berfungsi sebagai penyerap polusi
udara. Menurut data dari Kementerian PUPR
pada tahun 2019 dari 174 kota yang
mengikuti program Kota Hijau, baru 13 kota
saja yang menyediakan RTH dalam tatanan
kota mereka (Defitri, 2023). Nyatanya,
berdasarkan UU No. 26 Tahun 2007 tentang
Penataan Ruang mengatur bahwa minimal
harus ada 30% total RTH dalam tiap kota di
Indonesia, sementara berdasarkan data dari
Kementerian Lingkungan Hidup dan
Kehutanan pada tahun 2020, terpantau
masih ban yak kota yang tidak memenuhi
standar tersebut  (SIPSN, 2020). Tingkat
deforestasi hutan yang tinggi dengan
minimnya RTH di Indonesia memang
berbanding lurus kepada kualitas udara
Indonesia yang cukup buruk.

Penulis mengajak untuk
mempersempit isu ini kepada kondisi
lingkungan di Jakarta. Sebagai ibukota
bahkan pusat kegiatan hiburan, bisnis
hingga pemerintahan, Jakarta menjadi kota
yang penting untuk diamati. Terkenal
sebagai kota metropolitan, Jakarta
menempati peringkat pertama se -ASEAN
sebagai kota yang penuh dengan polusi
pada tahun 2018 berdasarkan penelitian
yang dikeluarkan oleh AirVisual dan
dibagikan dalam akun Instagram Green
Peace Indonesia (@greenpeaceid). Dalam
tahun berikutnya, Jakarta masuk ke d alam
daftar kota dengan pencemaran udara
terburuk sebagai peringkat 4 di dunia
(Mantalean & Maharani, 2019). Kondisi
ibukota Indonesia sendiri ternyata tidak
dalam keadaan yang prima, kualitas udara
dan polusi tentu berdampak langsung dalam
kehidupan masyarakat, ternyata keadaan
kualitas udara di Jakarta tidak hanya
disebabkan oleh perubahan iklim semata
namun juga didorong oleh aktivitas
kendaraan warga Jakarta yang menciptakan
emisi dan polutan. Badan Pusat Statistik
(BPS) memperlihatkan ada kenaikan yang
cukup tinggi dalam kepemilikan kendaraan
pribadi, penulis mengambil data kepemilikan
motor dan mobil yang biasanya digunakan
untuk keperluan mobilitas pribadi, sejak
tahun 2018 hingga 2020 ada kenaikan pesat
mengenai kepemilikan kendaraan pribadi
(motor dan mobil). Pada tahun 2018,
sebanyak 18.1 juta unit kendaran dimiliki
oleh masyarakat Jakarta, angka ini
meningkat pada tahun 2020 sebanyak 1.4
juta dengan total 19.5 juta unit kendaraan di
DKI Jakarta (BPS DKI Jakarta, 2022). Jika
dibandingkan dengan Hong Kong dan
Singapura, Jakarta jauh memiliki lebih
banyak kendaraan, bahkan pada tahun 2020
Jakarta memiliki 5x lebih banyak kendaraan
dibandingkan Singapura dan Hong Kong
(Jakarta Property Institute, 2020).
Hal ini tentu meninggalkan pengaruh
tidak sehat kepada masyarakat sekitar, sejak
2018 ada 65.140 kasus Tuberkulosis Paru
(TB Paru), yang mana penyakit ini dapat
diakibatkan oleh rusaknya kualitas udara,
sedangkan pada tahun 2020 kasus TB Paru
menurun drastis sebanyak 44.312 kasus, hal
ini dikarenakan pada tahun 2020 adanya
pandemi COVID -19 yang melarang
masyarakat melakukan aktivita s di luar
rumah yang berarti tak ada kendaraan
berlalu-lalang. Hingga pada tahun
berikutnya, angka kembali menunjukkan
kenaikan, pada tahun 2021 total ada 53.708
kasus TB Paru  (BPS DKI Jakarta, 2021).
Bukan hanya TB Paru, salah satu penyakit
yang juga marak terjadi di kawasan Jakarta
merupakan Infeksi Saluran Pernafasan Akut
(ISPA). Sejak tahun 2016 hingga tahun
2018, kasus ISPA berada diangka 1.8 juta

kasus selama tiga tahun berturut -turut, lalu
mengalami penurunan pada tahun 2019
(CNN Indonesia, 2019). Namun, hingga saat
ini warga Jakarta masih mengeluhkan
keruhnya kualitas udara Jakarta, misalnya
dalam salah satu liputan bersama Menteri
Pariwisata dan Ekonomi Kreatif, Sandiaga
Uno mengaku menerima laporan dari
Presiden RI, Joko Widodo, untuk segera
menangani kotornya udara Jakarta
dikarenakan Presiden telah merasakan
sendiri efek dari buruknya kualitas udara
Jakarta (Ramadhan & Prabowo, 2023).
Berdasarkan pemaparan di atas,
tulisan ini bermaksud untuk memfokuskan
peran kota dalam konteks paradiplomasi
yang dinilai dapat berperan nyata dalam
penyelesaian isu perubahan iklim, terkhusus
Provinsi DKI Jakarta.
Salah satu hal yang dilakukan
Jakarta dalam menangani masalah
lingkungan yang kian hari kian memburuk
merupakan penggunaan koneksi
paradiplomasi Jakarta dengan C40 dalam
memberlakukan kebijakan Low Emission
Zone atau LEZ.
Kebijakan LEZ merupakan kebijakan
yang mengatur lalu -lalang kendaraan
dengan tingkat emisi tertentu dalam sebuah
kawasan untuk memperbaiki kualitas udara
(Institute for Transportation Development
Policy Indonesia, 2022) . Kebijakan ini
membatasi pengendara memasuki kawasan
dengan melarang kendaraan yang tidak
memenuhi kualifikasi pembatasan gas emisi
dan hanya memperbolehkan transportasi
umum juga pribadi yang sudah lulus uji
kendaraan emisi dengan pemberian stiker
oren pada bagian kenda raan mereka.
Melihat kebijakan LEZ sebagai langkah yang
diambil oleh Pemerintah Provinsi (Pemprov)
DKI Jakarta guna menekan emisi GRK dan
mencapai kualitas udara yang lebih baik,
penulis merasa penting untuk melihat
bagaimana keberlangsungan dan proses
dari LEZ sendiri mencapai tujuannya.
 Kebijakan LEZ sendiri merupakan
satu-satunya kebijakan lingkungan yang
dilakukan secara penuh di Indonesia. Sudah
banyak penelitian terdahulu yang membahas
mengenai peran kebijakan lingkungan,
seperti penelitian yang dilakukan oleh
Purnaweni (2014) yang m elihat peran
kebijakan lingkungan sebagai kebijakan
yang bukan hanya mengelola namun juga
melindungi lingkungan di kawasan Kendeng
Utara. Dewi Fitriani bersama Sugiri (2022)
juga menyatakan bahwa kebijakan
lingkungan jika disosialisasikan dengan baik
dapat menambah tingkat awareness
masyarakat. Selain itu, dalam penelitian
yang dilakukan oleh Fauzie (2022) diteliti
bagaimana kebijakan lingkungan menjadi
salah satu respons pemerintah dalam

menyikapi kasus pencemaran limbah di
Kabupaten Sidoarjo, yang mana kebijakan
ini menjadi titik mula pemulihan dari
pencemaran limbah di sungai.
 Terkait paradiplomasi, Wu (2020)
memaparkan mengenai paradiplomasi yang
dinilai sebagai alternatif mencapai tujuan
global SDGs, penelitian Wu fokus melihat
peran negara Asia Tenggara yang mulai
menjadi bagian penting dalam
paradiplomasi. Fathun (2021) turut
membagikan potensi paradiplomasi dalam
memperkenalkan dan mengembangkan
wilayah Jember. Davidson et al (2019) juga
membagikan bagaimana jaringan kota
(paradiplomasi) turut mengasah
kemampuan kota satu sama lain.
Lebih jauh, paradiplomasi
merupakan aksi diplomasi modern yang
tidak hanya membatasi negara sebagai aktor
internasional namun juga pemerintah daerah
atau pemerintah daerah (Pemda). Diplomasi
tradisional yang lekat dengan high-class,
protokoler dan eksklusif telah berkembang
seturut dengan waktu menjadi lebih fleksibel
dalam sifatnya dan tidak terbatas pada
negara sebagai aktor satu -satunya (Fathun,
2016). Sehingga dapat disimpulkan
paradiplomasi merupakan langkah yang
tepat dalam menangani isu lingkungan yang
dialami kota-kota di dunia, termasuk Jakarta.
Penelitian terdahulu yang penulis
sampaikan di atas menjadi landasan penulis
dalam melakukan penelitian terhadap
kebijakan LEZ yang dikeluarkan pemerintah
Jakarta dalam konteks ratifikasi C40 dalam
kurun waktu 2021-2023. Yang membedakan
dengan penelitian -penelitian terdahulu,
penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menjelaskan
bagaimana implementasi Low Emission
Zone (LEZ) dan kaitan paradiplomasi
Pemprov DKI Jakarta dengan C40.

KERANGKA TEORI
Organisasi Internasional
Hubungan antarnegara yang terus
berlangsung bahkan menjadi komponen
penting bagi dunia internasional
menciptakan sebuah kebutuhan akan
adanya sebuah organisasi internasional.
Negara yang dahulu merupakan satu -
satunya aktor dan subyek dari hukum
internasional menciptakan sebuah
instabilitas sehingga dibuatlah organisasi
internasional untuk mencegah instabilitas
tersebut dengan menjadi penengah dan
wadah bagi negara -negara untuk saling
berkomunikasi, berdiskusi hingga
berdiplomasi.
Peran organisasi internasional
sebagai penjaga stabilitas dunia dinyatakan
melalui peran organisasi internasional
seperti PBB yang turut ikut dalam konflik -

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.54


215

konflik atau isu -isu kolektif seperti
kemiskinan, pendidikan, pemerintahan
hingga kerusakan lingkungan (Monica &
Suarnata, 2023) . Tidak hanya itu saja,
organisasi internasional turut memiliki
haknya tersendiri untuk memenuhi
kewajibannya dalam menjaga stabilitas
dunia, seperti hak untuk membuat perjanjian
internasional yang mengikat negara -negara
anggota dengan pengenaan sanksi jika
melakukan pelanggaran (Cornelesz, 2018).
Guna mencapai tujuan -tujuan di atas,
organisasi internasional memiliki beberapa
media yang dapat digunakan sesuai dengan
tingkat kegentingan konflik atau isu yang
ditangani, media -media tersebut berupa
negosiasi, good offices , konsolidasi dan
masih banyak lagi.

Paradiplomasi
Frasa paradiplomacy atau paradiplomasi
mulai dikenal setelah adanya perdebatan
mengenai aktivitas pemerintahan non -pusat
yang berhubungan dengan hubungan luar
negeri pada tahun 1980 -an. Paradiplomasi
sendiri berawal dari dua kata “paralel” dan
“diplomasi” yang akhirnya digabungkan oleh
Panayotis Soldatos, seorang ilmuwan dari
Bosque menjadi paradiplomasi. Perdebatan
ini muncul dikarenakan sempitnya cakupan
hubungan internasional sebagai bidang studi
kala itu yang hanya mengikut sertakan
beberapa aktor dalam  sebuah hubungan
internasional, salah satu aktor yang tidak
diikutsertakan adalah peran pemerintahan
non-pusat atau sub -nasional (Alvarez,
2020).
Perdebatan terjadi karena ada pihak
yang beranggapan bahwa keterlibatan
pemerintah non-pusat dalam hubungan luar
negeri akan menciptakan sebuah
pertandingan antara daerah dengan negara
atau bahkan mencapai keputusan krusial,
seperti daerah memilih untuk me misahkan
diri mereka dari negara itu sendiri. Hal
tersebut bisa terjadi khususnya pada daerah
atau provinsi yang memang memiliki
ketegangan dengan pemerintah pusat dan
memiliki tendensi untuk memisahkan diri,
seperti Quebec misalnya yang merasa
berbeda dari daerah-daerah lain di Kanada
bahkan menetapkan bahasa Prancis
sebagai bahasa nasionalnya ketika daerah
lain menetapkan Inggris sebagai bahasa
resmi mereka  (Star, 2015). Seperti yang
dikatakan Rodrigo Tavares yang
mendefinisikan paradiplomasi sebagai solusi
bagi para daerah yang memiliki tantangan
baik dalam lingkungan, sosial dan juga
perekonomian yang berskala global dan
membutuhkan solusi global pula, yang
dalam hal ini paradiplomasi dapat
menyediakan hal tersebut dengan
menyediakan ruang kolaboratif antara
daerah dengan daerah lain dalam arena

Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)

216
internasional. Aktivitas paradiplomasi ini
terus bertumbuh bahkan melampaui aktivitas
diplomasi tradisional yang dilakukan oleh
pemerintah pusat, sehingga ia
menyimpulkan adanya potensi terjadinya
penantangan atau bahkan perlawanan
diplomasi antara pemerin tah sub -nasional
dengan pusat (Tavares, 2016).
Berbeda dengan Tavares, Cornago
mendefinisikan Paradiplomasi sendiri
sebagai sebuah aktivitas kerja sama
internasional yang dilakukan oleh
pemerintahan non-pusat dengan aktor-aktor
internasional di luar cakupan wilayahnya
atau yang disebut pihak asing -baik swasta
maupun publik  (Cornago, 1999). Sejalan
dengan Wolff (2007), paradiplomasi sebagai
sebuah aktivitas atau kegiatan yang dimiliki
oleh aktor sub -nasional yang memiliki
kapasitas dalam menjalin kerja sama di
arena internasional untuk mengejar
kepentingan-kepentingan internasional
tertentu. Paradiplomasi tidak berlang sung
begitu saja, mengingat aktornya merupakan
aktor sub -nasional atau non -pusat maka
segala tindakan dan kepentingan yang ingin
dicapai oleh pemerintah daerah haruslah
sejalan dengan tujuan nasional dan harus
diketahui oleh pemerintah pusat sebagai
aktor utama (Mukti, 2013). Sehingga dapat
disimpulkan jika kegiatan Paradiplomasi
memang diakui namun ada batasan-batasan
yang harus diperhatikan mengenai
tujuannya agar tidak berseberangan dengan
tujuan nasional pemerintah pusat.
Dalam bukunya, Politik
Paradiplomasi dan Isu Kedaulatan di
Indonesia, Takdir Ali Mukti merumuskan
setidaknya dua belas prinsip Paradiplomasi
yang berlaku di Indonesia (Mukti, 2020). Dari
kedua belas prinsip yang telah dirangkum,
penulis melihat terdapat empat prinsip yang
mampu mendefinisikan paradiplomasi
Indonesia sesuai dengan hukum nasional
yang berlaku. Penulis mengambil empat
prinsip yang mewakili kedua belas prinsip
tersebut. Keempat prinsip itu merupakan: (1)
kewajiban untuk berkonsultasi/berkoordinasi
dengan pemerintah pusat; (2)
pelaksanaannya aman secara politis, yuridis,
keamanan dan teknis; (3) sesuai dengan
bidang kewenangan pemerintah daerah; (4)
kepala daerah/gubernur /bupati sebagai
perwakilan daerah dalam kerja sama luar
negeri.
Serangkaian teori dan kerangka
pemikiran di atas menghantar untuk
mengerti lebih dalam dan luas mengenai
Paradiplomasi. Konsep Paradiplomasi inilah
yang Penulis gunakan dalam mengkaji
kebijakan Low Emission Zone (LEZ) sebagai
sebuah kebijakan yang diterbitkan Anies
Baswedan dalam rangka meratifikasi misi

C40 untuk memerangi peningkatan Emisi
Gas Rumah Kaca (GRK).

METODE PENELITIAN
Penelitian kualitatif deskriptif menjadi pilihan
bagi penulis dalam melangsungkan
penelitian. Penelitian kualitatif deskriptif
sebagai upaya peneliti guna
menjelaskan/mendeskripsikan suatu
fenomena/peristiwa/kejadian/gejala yang
terjadi saat ini dengan car a mengolah data-
data yang diperoleh sebagai bahan analisa
(Sudjana & Ibrahim, 2001). Penlitian ini
menggunakan teknik wawancara sebagai
studi lapangan (field study) dan analisis
dokumen sebagai studi literatur  (literature
study).
Dalam penelitian ini, peneliti
mewawancara Tim Perencanaan
Lingkungan DLH DKI Jakarta sebagai data
primer dan studi literatur sebagai data
sekunder.

HASIL DAN PEMBAHASAN
Cities 40 (C40) Sebagai Aktor Pendukung
Kebijakan Low Emission Zone
C40 adalah sebuah jaringan kota-kota besar
dunia yang berkomitmen untuk mengatasi
perubahan iklim. C40 yang memiliki visi,
misi, dan tujuan untuk menyelesaikan isu
lingkungan yang merupakan isu global
dengan cara lokal, dan yang juga sebagai
wadah bagi anggotanya membuatnya
memiliki peranan penting dalam
mengakomodasi kesulitan para anggota.
Salah satu tujuan C40 yang ingin dicapai
melalui peran tiap kota anggota adalah untuk
menekan tingkat emisi GRK yang merusak
lingkungan, khususnya kualitas udar a.
Dengan diketahuinya bahwa pemakaian
kendaraan dalam jumlah yang masif
merupakan salah satu penyumbang emisi
GRK terbesar, maka cara untuk mengurangi
tingkat penggunaan kendaraan merupakan
solusi yang tepat. Salah satu penyelesaian
yang direkomendasikan oleh C40
merupakan pengimplementasian Low
Emission Zone (LEZ), yang mana kebijakan
ini membatasi tingkat kendaraan yang
melintasi suatu zona tertentu yang telah
disepakati menjadi area LEZ.
Dalam laman resmi  Institute for
Transportation and Development Policies
(ITDP), LEZ merupakan sebuah kebijakan
yang mengatur pembatasan kendaraan
beremisi dengan strategi yang dapat dibagi
menjadi dua: pembayaran dan non -
pembayaran. Strategi pembayaran
dimaksudkan sebagai jalur yang mewajibkan
pelintasnya untuk membayar, besar-kecilnya
harga yang ia bayarkan tergentung dengan
seberapa tinggi emisi yang diproduksi oleh
kendaraan mereka. Jadi, semakin tinggi

Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.54


218
tingkat emisinya maka semakin besar harga
yang harus mereka bayar, sementara
kendaraan listrik atau kendaraan yang
memproduksi emisi di bawah angka
maksimum membayar dengan harga yang
lebih sedikit atau bahkan tidak membayar
sama sekali  (Institute for Transportation &
Development Policy, 2023) . LEZ menjadi
kebijakan strategis yang paling banyak
digunakan oleh berbagai anggota C40
sendiri, hal ini menunjukkan bahwa LEZ
sendiri dinilai merupakan kebijakan
lingkungan yang sangat cocok menjawab
permasalahan kota dengan kualitas udara
yang buruk. Se bagai bentuk dukungan C40
bagi para anggota untuk
mengimplementasikan LEZ, C40
merumuskan tahapan -tahapan yang harus
dilakukan guna mencapai LEZ demi
pencapaian yang maksimal.
 Sebagai bentuk dukungan C40 bagi
para anggota untuk mengimplementasikan
LEZ, C40 merumuskan tahapan -tahapan
yang harus dilakukan guna mencapai LEZ
dengan kualitas yang maksimal dan hasil
yang terbaik. Tahap pertama berkaitan
dengan penentuan lokasi LEZ, dengan
beberapa pertimbangan yang harus
dipikirkan sebelum memutuskan
menetapkan sebuah lokasi menjadi kawasan
LEZ. Beberapa pertimbangannya yaitu:
lokasi dengan polutan utama, siapa saja
yang terpapar dengan polutan tersebut
(pekerja, pejalan kaki, pelajar, pusat
rekreasi, penduduk sekitar); bagaimana
skala tingkat kemacetan di lokasi tersebut;
bagaimana demografi lokasi tersebut dan
meninjau apa yang terbesit dalam pikiran
masyarakat sekitar mengenai polusi udara
dan emisi. Pertimbangan ini menjadi sebuah
keharusan guna mencapai hasil yang
maksimal. Secara umum, lokasi-lokasi yang
mencapai kualitas dari pertimbangan di atas
merupakan sebuah pusat kota dengan
tingkat penduduk dan aktivitas yang tinggi
karena hal ini akan berbanding lurus dengan
banyaknya korban yang berjatuhan nantinya
akibat rusaknya kualitas udara. Pemerintah
daerah harus menugaskan sebuah badan
independen untuk menganalisi lebih dalam
untuk mengumpulkan informasi sebagai
bahan dasar diambilnya keputusan
mengenai pemilihan lokasi sebagai kawasan
LEZ (C40 Knowledge Hub, 2023).
 Tahap kedua adalah memastikan
bahwa kebijakan LEZ memiliki dasar hukum
yang kuat. Pengesahan LEZ sebagai hukum
satu kota tertentu akan membuat
pengimplementasiannya menjadi lebih
mudah, apalagi dengan adanya hukum
maka kota memiliki hak penuh untuk
mengimplementasikan kebijakan ini. Hal
tersebut juga dapatmengurangi hambatan -

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.54


219

hambatan yang dapat menghalangi
pengerjaan kebijakan tersebut.
 Berikutnya adalah mengenai
pembatasan dan pelarangan. Pembatasan
dan pelarangan tentunya menjadi bagian
yang penting dari kebijakan LEZ, hal ini
justru menjadi salah satu kunci untuk
mencapai tujuan dalam menekan tingkat
emisi GRK. C40 memulai tahap ini dengan
menyarankan untuk menetapkan
diberlakukannya penutupan beberapa ruas
jalan dari kendaraan pribadi apapun,
termasuk kendaraan listrik, dan hanya
dikhususkan kepada para pejalan kaki dan
pesepeda. Namun, jika penutupan jalan
tidak memungkinkan maka pem erintah
setempat dapat menetapkan tarif denda
yang harus dibayarkan kendaraan yang
diperbolehkan untuk melintasi kawasan LEZ
dengan harga tertentu mengikuti seberapa
banyak emisi yang mereka keluarkan.
 Selain itu, C40 juga menyoroti
bagaimana penggunaan lahan umum yang
dijadikan sebagai lahan parkir bukanlah hal
yang bijak. C40 mendorong agar
penggunaan lahan publik dijadikan sebagai
taman rekreasi atau fasilitas bagi pejalan
kaki. Hal tersebut menunjukkan bagaimana
keberpihakan pemerintah setempat dalam
mendukung para pejalan kaki atau pesepeda
untuk beraktivitas. Di samping mengalihkan
lahan parkir, C40 juga menekankan untuk
mengurangi kuantitas lahan parkir di area
LEZ guna mendukung pengurangan tingkat
kendaraan.
 C40 memahami tidak seluruh kota
mendapatkan kesempatan atau hak untuk
mengimplementasikan tahapan -tahapan di
atas. Namun, kondisi tersebut tidaklah dapat
menghentikan pemerintah daerah dalam
memperbaiki kualitas udara mereka. Salah
satu saran yang diberikan C40 kepada kota-
kota dengan kondisi seperti ini adalah
dengan menerapkan LEZ secara sukarela
atau kebijakan yang tidak mengikat.
 Akan tetapi, tahapan-tahapan di atas
tidak cukup. Diperlukan dukungan-dukungan
lain guna memaksimalkan implementasi
kebijakan LEZ, guna menciptakan kebijakan
yang inklusif yang menolong seluruh lapisan
masyarakat. Dukungan -dukungan yang
dibutuhkan berupa:  (1) menjadikan LEZ
sebagai strategi kota guna memperlancar
implementasi kebijakannya dengan
melakukan promosi penggunaan
transportasi umum dan penggunaan trotoar
juga jalur sepeda bagi pejalan kaki dan
pesepeda; (2) memberikan bantuan dana
bagi para indiv idu dengan penghasilan
rendah, organisasi nirlaba atau UMKM di
sekitar kawasan LEZ yang menggunakan
kendaraan dalam operasionalnya. Bantuan
dana dapat diberikan untuk mendukung para
aktor di atas untuk mengganti moda

220
kendaraan mereka menjadi kendaraan listrik
yang lebih ramah lingkungan, atau bantuan
juga dapat diberikan dalam bentuk
pengecualian bagi mereka untuk dapat
melintasi zona LEZ tanpa mendapat denda
atau dihitung sebagai pelanggaran; (3)
membangun pos -pos pengisian daya
kendaraan listrik sebagai dukungan
pemerintah daerah kepada masyarakat
untuk mengubah moda transportasi
berbahan bakar minyak menjadi transportasi
listrik; (4) mendanai kebijakan LEZ untuk
memantapkan pengimplementasiannya,
seperti pembangunan fasilitas umum dan
jalur pesepeda. Penerapan tarif atau road
pricing bagi kendaraan yang diperbolehkan
melintas dalam kawasan LEZ dapat
digunakan sebagai sumber dana  (C40
Knowledge Hub, 2023).
Melalui laman resmi C40, dapat
dilihat bahwasannya LEZ menjadi salah satu
kebijakan yang banyak diimplementasikan
oleh para anggota C40. Dalam
pengimplementasiannya, negara -negara ini
memodifikasi kebijakan LEZ sesuai dengan
keadaaan kota dan prioritas mer eka.
Sejumlah kota anggota C40 yang
menerapkan LEZ di antaranya, London,
Inggris; Shenzhen, Tiongkok; Seoul, Korea
Selatan; dan Lisbon, Portugal.
Secara konkrit, C40 juga
menyediakan guidelines yang dapat diikuti
oleh para anggota dalam
mengimplementasikan kebijakan LEZ di
wilayah masing-masing. Guidelines C40 ini
mempermudah perancangan kota dalam
men-design atau merumuskan penetapan
kebijakan LEZ di wilayah mereka, guidelines
ini juga dapat menjadi panduan yang dapat
diikuti oleh para anggota guna mendapatkan
hasil yang maksimal dari
pengimpelementasian LEZ, sehingga setiap
anggota tidak perlu memulai dari nol dan
memiliki waktu lebih banyak dalam
mempersiapkan penetapannya. Namun,
bukan hanya itu, C40 juga memberikan
bantuan teknis yang dinikmati oleh beberapa
kota, termasuk Jakarta. Pada pertemuan
KTT Aksi Iklim Global COP 28, C40 Cities
bersama dengan Bloomberg Philantrophies
dan Clean Air Fund merancang sebuah
jaringan kota baru bernama, Breathe Cities.
Kelompok terbari Breathe Cities berisi atas 9
(sembilan) kota, di antaranya: Accra, Ghana;
Brussel, Belgia; Jakarta, Indonesia;
Johannesburg, Afrika Selatan; Milan, Italia;
Nairobi, Kenya; Paris, Prancis; Rio de
Janeiro, Brasil; dan Sofia, Bulgaria.
Kelompok ini, merupakan kelompok pertama
dari Breathe Cities yang sebelumnya
merupakan program atas satu kota  (Clean
Air Fund, 2023).
Breathe Cities berawal dari sebuah
program perbaikan kualitas udara di kota

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.54


221

London dengan nama, Breathe London.
Pada tahun 2018, Breathe London dibuat
sebagai program untuk memonitor kualitas
udara London dengan biaya yang terbilang
rendah serta guna meningkatkan awareness
masyarakat London mengenai pentingnya
kualitas udara yang baik. Hal tersebut adalah
salah satu agenda Wali Kota London kala itu
untuk memperbaiki kualitas udara di sana
(Breathe Cities, 2024). Dengan hasil yang
dirasa memuaskan, Breathe London
meluaskan sayapnya di laur wilayah London
dengan naungan Clean Air Fund dan
Bloomberg Philantrophies. Ibukota Polandia,
Warsaw, mengambil langkah yang sama
dengan London untuk memperbaiki kualitas
udara mereka. Maka terciptalah, Breathe
Warsaw pada tahun 2022.
Breathe Cities yang diisi oleh
sembilan kota anggota C40, termasuk
Jakarta, memiliki misi tersendiri pula. Misi
yang dirancang oleh Breathe Cities adalah
untuk mengurangi polusi udara di masing -
masing kota sebanyak 30% pada tahun
2030. Apabila target tersebut tercapai, maka
akan mencegah 39.000 kematian dini dan
79.000 kasus asma baru pada anak -anak
ditiap dekadenya dan juga menghemat $107
miliar sebagai biaya rawat inap dan
kematian. Peran Breathe Cities sendiri,
selain sebagai penyedia data monitor
kualitas udara di tiap kota secara berkala dan
sebagai konselor kebijakan lingkungan juga
berperan sebagai penyedia dana, yang
mana Breathe Cities yang dinaungi oleh
Clean Air Fund, Bloomberg Philantrophies
dan C40 Cities memberikan dana sebesar
$30 juta yang diberikan pada awal tahun
2024 (Clean Air Fund, 2023).
Kolaborasi Pemprov DKI Jakarta -WRI
Indonesia dan ITDP Indonesia
Implementasi kebijakan Low Emission Zone
di Jakarta sendiri tentunya memerlukan
perencanaan yang baik untuk hasil yang baik
pula. Dalam prosesnya, Pemprov DKI
Jakarta menggaet World Resources Institute
(WRI) Indonesia dan Institute of
Transportation Development Policy (ITDP)
Indonesia dalam membuat perencanaan
yang matang. Kedua organisasi di atas
merupakan organisasi non-pemerintah yang
berbeda dengan C40. Dalam salah satu
unggahan WRI Indonesia yang dapat
diakses melalui website resminya, dapat kita
lihat bahwa WRI Indonesia membagai
beberapa tahapan guna mengusung hasil
yang maksimal dari diterapkannya kebijakan
LEZ.
Implementasi LEZ di Kota Tua
Mengacu pada ke -empat tahap yang
dipaparkan oleh tim riset WRI Indonesia,
Kota Tua nampak memenuhi semua
kualitasnya. Dalam tahap perencanaan,
Kota Tua memenuhi kualifikasi sebagai

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.54


222
lokasi kawasan rendah emisi dengan
pamornya sebagai pusat wisata sejarah
negara Indonesia. Selain itu, Kota Tua yang
juga dilindungi sebagai cagar budaya negara
tentu menambah peran pentingnya untuk
dilestarikan dari emisi GRK yang merusak.
Kota Tua juga d apat dijangkau
menggunakan transportasi umum,
pengunjung Kota Tua dapat menggunakan
KRL Jabodetabek dan TransJakarta.
Bagi pengguna KRL, pengunjung
dapat turut di Stasiun Jakarta Kota,
sedangkan bagi pengguna TransJakarta
dapat turun di Halte Kota, Halte Kali Besar
Barat, Halte Museum Fatahillah, sehingga
pembatasan arus lalu lintas tidak akan
menjadi masalah untuk mengun jungi Kota
Tua. Selain itu, untuk mengurangi jumlah
kendaraan di kawasan LEZ, Pemprov DKI
Jakarta juga banyak membangun jalur
sepeda dan trotoar bagi pesepeda dan
pejalan kaki. Hal tersebut merupakan bentuk
dukungan bagi para pengunjung juga
masyarakat sekitar untuk mulai mengurangi
penggunaan kendaraan umum yang menjadi
penyebab utama tingginya tingkat emisi
GRK di Jakarta.
Pada tahap pra -impelementasi,
Pemprov DKI Jakarta juga telah melakukan
komunikasi publik khususnya kepada para
penghuni atau tenant yang terdampak
dikarenakan penutupan ruas jalan. Para
tenant kawasan LEZ telah diinfokan, baik
secara tersurat maupun melalui online
meeting mengenai jalur alternatif yang dapat
digunakan sebagai lahan parkir di Glodok
dan Kota Intan. Namun, tidak seluruh tenant
terinformasi secara menyeluruh dikarenakan
penyebaran informasi yang tidak berjalan
dengan baik. Selain kepada para tenant,
sosialisasi juga dilakukan kepada para
masyarakat awam melalui penyebaran flyer
dan sosial media. Informasi yang disebar
meliputi penjelasan mengenai LEZ,
penutupan jalur, jalur alternatif hingga rute -
rute transportasi umum yang dapat
digunakan untuk menuju kepada kawasan
LEZ. LEZ di Kota Tua juga sudah
melangsungkan uji coba sebagai salah satu
tahapan dalam pra -implementasinya. Tepat
pada 18 Desember 2023 hingga 23
Desember 2023, LEZ resmi diuji coba di Kota
Tua dan mendapatkan respons positif dari
para profesional dengan harapan kota -kota
lain di Indonesia mengikuti jejak Pemprov
DKI Jakarta (Saputra, 2020).
Dalam tahap implementasi,
ditemukan kurang optimalnya penjagaan
dan kontrol atas kendaraan yang dilarang
melintasi jalur dalam kawasan LEZ,
banyaknya pengendara yang ditemui
melanggar aturan dengan menerobos
pembatas jalan yang sudah diatur oleh
Pemprov DKI Jakarta. Hal ini dapat menjadi

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.54


223

akibat dari kurangnya sosialisasi dan
edukasi kepada masyarakat dan tenant
sekitar untuk memahami alasan LEZ
diterapkan. Evaluasi secara berkala juga
dilakukan dalam tahapan ini, khususnya
mengenai penutupan dan pengalihan jalur
yang disusun oleh Dinas Perhubungan.
Berikut beberapa evaluasi Dinas
Perhubungan yang dapat dirangkum
(Institute for Transportation Development
Policy Indonesia, 2022):
• April 2021: keluhan datang dari para
pelaku usaha yang memiliki tempat di
kawasan LEZ dan dari para
pengendara yang mengeluhkan
sempitnya beberapa ruas alternatif
dikarenakan pedagang kaki lima
(PKL) yang berdagang di sepanjang
jalan.
• November 2021: penutupan Jalan
Pintu Besar Selatan untuk seluruh
kendaraan dikarenakan
pembangunan Moda Raya Terpadu
(MRT) Mangga Besar-Kota.
• Agustus 2022: Jalan Kunir diubah
menjadi jalur dua arah yang dinilai
dapat meningkatkan aksesibilitas.
Selain itu, kendaraan yang menuju
arah timur dialihkan kepada Jalan
Tambora dan Jalan Pintu Kecil.
Berlanjut pada tahapan terakhir,
kontrol dan monitoring, tahapan ini dibagi
kepada pengawasan, progres, dan
penyebarluasan. Pengawasan yang
dilakukan pihak berwenang, seperti Dinas
Perhubungan, menampilkan hasil yang tidak
cukup memuaskan. Seperti laporan evaluasi
di atas, nampaknya masih banyak
pengendara nakal yang memasuki zona LEZ
tanpa izin. Hal ini berdampak langsung
kepada kemajuan dari LEZ sendiri. Dalam
laporan kualitas udara yang dipublikasikan
langsung oleh Dinas Lingkungan Hidup,
ketika dilakuka n perbandingan kualitas
udara 2 (dua) hari sebelum dan 2 (dua) hari
sesudah LEZ diterapkan, hasil tes
menunjukkan adanya penurunan emisi
PM2.5 yang cukup signifikan. Namun di hari
yang sama, pada jam 13.00 alat pendeteksi
menunjukkan peningkatan emisi PM2. 5.
Dilaporkan bahwa belum dapat dipastikan
apa penyebab dari kenaikan PM2.5 tersebut,
namun ada beberapa dugaan seperti
banyaknya pengendara nakal yang kerap
masuk dalam zona LEZ atau penumpukan
pengendara di jalur alternatif dikarenakan
banyaknya jalur yang ditutup  (DLH DKI
Jakarta, 2021). Dilanjutkan pada tahun 2022,
data menunjukkan peningkatan emisi PM2.5
di Jakarta secara keseluruhan, tidak ada
data khusus yang disajikan terkait dengan
kawasan Kota Tua. Namun, DLH DKI
Jakarta mengamati peningkatan uji coba
emisi kendaraan dari tahun ke tahun

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.54


224
menunjukkan terjadinya peningkatan pesat
dimulai dari tahun 2021.
Pada tahun 2023, hasil laporan DLH
DKI Jakarta menunjukkan adanya kenaikan
emisi PM2.5 di Kota Tua, khususnya dimulai
dari bulan Maret hingga November.
Berdasarkan hasil data penelitian,
konsentrasi PM2.5 mengalami peningkatan
pada jam 7.00 hingga 9.00 WIB juga jam
18.00 WIB  (DLH DKI Jakarta, 2023).
Kenaikan ini berkemungkinan dikarenakan
naiknya aktivitas pengendara ketika
berangkat bekerja dan juga kembali pulang.

Implementasi LEZ di Tebet Eco Park
Tidak banyak laporan yang dikeluarkan
Pemprov DKI mengenai impelementasi LEZ
di Tebet Eco Park, kemungkinan besar hal ini
dikarenakan pemberlakuan kebijakan yang
terbilang masih cukup baru, kecilnya luasan
dan jam operasional yang terbatas. Jika
dibandingkan, impelementasi LEZ di Kota
Tua berbanding jauh jika dibandingkan
dengan implementasi di Tebet Eco Park.
Implementasi LEZ di Kota Tua sendiri mulai
diresmikan pada 8 Februari 2021 dan
diberlakukan selama 24 jam atau dapat
dikatakan tidak pernah berhenti.  Sementara
itu, implementasi LEZ di Tebet Eco Park baru
dimulai pada 20 Agustus 2022 dan hanya
diberlakukan pada hari libur dan akhir pekan
juga dalam jangka waktu yang terbilang lebih
kecil, yakni selama 10 (sepuluh) jam, dimulai
dari jam 7.00 pagi hingga jam 17.00 sore
hari. Begitu juga dengan cakupan kawasan
LEZ, kawasan LEZ di Kota Tua menutup
enam ruas jalan besar dengan beberapa
jalur sebagai jalur alternatf, sementara zona
LEZ di Tebet Eco Park hanya mengambil
jalan yang mengelilingi akses kepada taman
saja, yaitu Jalan Tebet Barat dan Jalan Tebet
Timur. Ketiga alasan di atas dapat menjadi
beberapa alasan yang menguatkan
mengapa kawasan Tebet Eco Park tidak
menjadi perhatian utama.
Dalam implementasinya, LEZ di Kota
Tua dan Tebet Eco Park tidak jauh berbeda.
Tetap ada pembatasan jalur bagi kendaraan
yang memang tidak memenuhi uji emisi dan
pemberian stiker bagi kendaraan yang
memenuhi uji emisi yang dapat berlalu -
lalang di sekitar Tebet Eco Park, akan tetapi,
ada pengecualian yang disediakan bagi
Pemprov DKI Jakarta bagi warga sekitar
kawasan. Pemprov DKI Jakarta memberikan
kelonggaran bagi masyarakat sekitar dalam
menggunakan kendaraan mereka, walau
tidak memenuhi standar uji emisi. Pemprov
DKI Jakarta melakukan hal ini dengan
mengumpulkan data kendaraan masyarakat
sekitar dan memberikan stiker digital izin lalu
lintas yang dapat di -scan oleh aparat
setempat, yang mana stiker tersebut
memuat informasi kendaraan dan pemiliknya

Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)

225

yang terdata dalam sistem Pemprov. Pada
tahun 2022, sudah ada 400 kendaraan mobil
yang sudah terdata menurut pengakuan dari
Camat Tebet yang menjabat kala itu, Dyan
Airlangga. Data ini akan terus di-update oleh
Pemprov DKI Jakarta untuk memaksimalkan
pendataan kendaraan masyarakat  (Budi,
2022).
Selain itu, implementasi LEZ di Tebet
Eco Park juga melibatkan penggunaan
transportasi umum sebagai moda
transportasi utama. Kemudahan transportasi
umum menjadi salah satu variabel penting
bagi implementasi LEZ, dikarenakan
pembatasan kendaraan pribadi guna
menekan tingkat emisi GRK, karena itu
Pemprov DKI Jakarta mengusahakan
kemudahan akses Tebet Eco Park
menggunakan transportasi umum. Pilihan
transportasi umum yang tersedia juga cukup
lengkap, bagi pengguna kereta atau KRL
dapat memilih untuk turun di Stasiun
Cawang dan Stasiun Tebet sebagai pilihan
stasiun terdekat, dikarenakan jarak yang
masih terbilang jauh dari lokasi Tebet Eco
Park, Pemprov DKI Jakarta menyediakan
shuttle bus  yang dapat digunakan menuju
lokasi terkait. Sedangkan, bagi pengguna
bus TransJakarta, halte terdekat merupakan
Halte Tebet Eco Park di MT Haryono dengan
jarak yang tidak jauh dari Tebet Eco Park
(Nababan, 2022).
Pilihan moda transportasi umum
yang memadai membantu masyarakat tetap
dapat mengunjungi kawasan Tebet Eco Park
dengan mudah tanpa harus menggunakan
kendaraan pribadi yang dapat meningkatkan
emisi GRK di Jakarta. Namun, bagi
pengunjung yang tetap ingin mema kai
kendaraan pribadi, Pemprov juga
menyediakan fasilitas parkir di beberapa titik:
Lahan Sarana Jaya, SMPN 73 Jakarta,
Gedung Graha Pratama, Gedung Wisma
Pede, dan Pom Bensin SPBU 31 -128.
Kelima lahan parkir di atas memiliki
kapasitas yang berbeda -beda dengan tarif
yang berbeda pula  (Pemerintah Kota
Administrasi Jakarta Selatan, 2022).
Walaupun banyak persamaan atas
impementasi LEZ di Kota Tua dan Tebet Eco
Park, ada satu perbedaan yang cukup
signifikan: kebebasan pengunjung. Sebagai
salah satu tempat rekreasi di Jakarta, Kota
Tua dan Tebet Eco Park dipenuhi oleh
pengunjung tiap harinya.  Kota Tua yang
menawarkan wisata sejarah dan kuliner tidak
memiliki batasan jumlah pengunjung dan
tidak memiliki pendataan pengunjung pula,
sehingga masyarakat luar kawasan Kota
Tua yang ingin mendatangi Kota Tua dapat
langsung mengunjunginya tanpa melewati
prosedur tertentu. Hal tersebut berbeda
dengan Tebet Eco Park, karena sebagai
kawasan taman kota, Tebet Eco Park sendiri

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.54


226
dikunjungi oleh berbagai ragam usia, mulai
dari anak-anak, dewasa hingga lansia, dan
untuk menghindari kerumunan yang berlebih
Pemprov DKI Jakarta menerapkan sistem
pendaftaran. Masyarakat yang ingin
mengunjungi Tebet Eco Park diwajibkan
memiliki aplikasi JAKI terlebih dahulu dan
mendaftarkan dirinya melalui aplikasi
tersebut. Lalu, dari aplikasi yang sama
masyarakat dapat melihat berapa banyak
pengunjung yang mengujungi Tebet Eco
Park diwaktu yang sama. Dalam salah satu
unggahan di akun Tebet Eco Park,
@tebetecopark, diinformasikan bahwa
taman hanya dapat menampung 4.000
pengunjung per sesi pada hari Senin hingga
Jumat dan 5.000 pengunjung per sesi pada
hari Sabtu dan Minggu. Adapun sesi pertama
dimulai pada jam 7.00 -11.00 WIB dan sesi
kedua dimulai pada ja m 13.00 -17.00 WIB
(Agustian & Sari, 2022).
Pemberlakuan LEZ sendiri bukannya
tidak menjumpai tantangan, setidaknya ada
2 (dua) masalah yang ditemui Pemprov DKI
Jakarta, pedagang kaki lima (PKL) dan juga
pengunjung taman. Salah satu ketetapan
Pemprov DKI Jakarta kala itu adalah
pemberisahan kawasan Tebet Eco Park dari
PKL di sepanjang jalan, keramaian PKL di
sepanjang jalur dinilai tidak efektif dalam
memberlakukan kebijakan LEZ di sana,
sehingga Pemprov DKI Jakarta memutuskan
untuk melakukan pembersihan PKL di
sepanjang jalur dengan cara memindahkan
mereka.
Para PKL dipindahkan ke lokasi yang
tidak begitu jauh, mereka berada di sebelah
Rumah Susun (Rusun) Harum Tebet.
Namun, lokasi yang disediakan Pemprov
DKI Jakarta hanya dapat menampung
sebanyak 50 (lima puluh) PKL sehingga
aparat yang bertugas memang hanya
memprioritaskan para pedagang yang sudah
lama berdagang di kawasan Tebet Eco Park
untuk dipindahkan ke lokasi. Selain itu untuk
menghindari adanya pelanggaran dari para
pedagang, Pemprov DKI Jakarta
menugaskan Satuan Polisi Pramong Praja
(Satpol PP) dan S uku Dinas Perhubungan
Jakarta Selatan untuk mengawasi dan
mengamankan kawasan sekitar (Agustian &
Sari, 2022).
Masalah berikutnya datang dari
pengunjung, dalam salah satu wawancara
yang dilakukan detikNews dengan
pengunjung Tebet Eco Park, salah satu
pengunjung mengakui bahwa pemberlakuan
LEZ dengan membatasi kendaraan pribadi
melintas merupakan keputusan yang
menyulitkan bagi keluarga dengan anak -
anak yang ingin berkunjung. Lebih jauh,
pengunjung tersebut mengaku kesulitan
untuk mendapatkan tempat duduk bagi
dirinya dan anak-anak yang ia bawa. Hal ini

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.54


227

tidak dapat dipungkiri, dikarenakan masih
banyak pengguna transportasi umum yang
membiarkan pengunjung lain dengan anak
berdiri, kejadian ini banyak dijumpai di KRL
ataupun TransJakarta, tidak hanya itu,
keramaian transportasi umum juga menjadi
persoalan yang cukup sulit bagi keluarga
yang masih memiliki anak kecil, keramaian di
transportasi umum tentu membuat orang tua
khawatir berpisah dengan anak mereka.
Walaupun demikian, masih banyak
pengunjung yang mengakui bahwa
keputusan pemberlakuan LEZ ini adalah
keputusan yang baik, salah satu pengunjung
mengungkapkan pembatasan kendaraan
guna menekan tingkat emisi GRK akan
melindungi kawasan Tebet Eco Park dari
kerusakan dikarenakan polusi. Pengunjung
merasakan manfaatnya selama berada
dalam kawasan Tebet Eco Park, ia mengaku
merasa sejuk selama berada di sana (Budi,
2022).

Paradiplomasi Jakarta -Cities 40 dalam
Melangsungkan Low Emission Zone
Penelitian ini menganalisis praktik
paradiplomasi Jakarta yang memenuhi
prinsip-prinsip paradiplomasi menurut Mukti
(2020). Prinsip pertama, diwajibkan untuk
berkoordinasi dengan pemerintah pusat:
berdasarkan hasil wawancara penulis
dengan DLH DKI Jakarta,  Pemprov DKI
Jakarta telah melakukan konsultasi dan
koordinasi bersama dengan pemerintah
pusat. Pemerintah pusat yang dimaksud
merupakan Kementerian Lingkungan Hidup
dan Perhutanan dan juga dengan
Kementerian Koordinator Bidang
Kemaritiman dan Investasi. K oordinasi dan
konsultasi tersebut berlangsung dalam
sebuah pertemuan rapat formal antara
kedua instansi. Rapat ini berlangsung
tertutup dan memang tidak ada publikasi
resmi di dalamnya. Dalam wawancara yang
dilakukan penulis, DLH DKI Jakarta
mengaku sedang  merancangkan pedoman
LEZ bersama dengan Kementerian
Koordinator Bidang Kemaritiman dan
Investasi, dan juga Institute of Transportation
Development Policy Indonesia. Hal ini
menunjukkan bahwa Jakarta memenuhi
prinsip pertama dalam melangsungkan
paradiplomasi.
Kedua, pelaksanaannya aman
secara politik, yuridis, keamanan, dan teknis;
secara politis, kerja sama internasional yang
dijalin oleh Pemprov DKI Jakarta tidaklah
menyalahi aturan atau kebijakan tertentu
dari politik luar negeri Indonesia. Sebagai
contoh, s ifat politik luar negeri Indonesia
yang merupakan bebas dan aktif tidak
dihapuskan dalam paradipomasi yang dijalin
Jakarta dikarenakan Jakarta tidaklah
memihak dengan blok tertentu dan
menjalankan tindakannya secara bebas

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.54


228
tanpa tekanan pihak manapun. Secara
keamanan, paradiplomasi yang dijalin
Jakarta tidak mengancam pihak manapun
baik di dalam maupaun di luar dari wilayah
konstitusi Indonesia. Sehingga tidak ada
ancaman yang perlu diantisipasi dalam
paradiplomasi yang telah terjalin antara
Jakarta dengan C40. Secara yuridis dan
teknis, hasil kerja sama antara Jakarta
dengan C40 memiliki dasar hukum yang
menjamin proses dan tahapannya dalam
Peraturan Gubernur No. 90 Tahun 2021.
Dasar hukum ini menjamin kepastian
kebijakan in i dalam mencapai fungsinya
sebagai alat Pemprov DKI Jakarta dalam
memperbaiki kualitas udara mereka. Namun,
dikarenakan penetapan kebijakan yang
belum terlalu lama, belum ada susunan
teknis khusus yang sudah ditetapkan dalam
perancangan kebijakan ini. Sesuai 228 uet
o228ced yang disampaikan oleh pihak DLH
DKI Jakarta rancangan LEZ yang lebih
matang sedang dalam proses penyusunan
bersama dengan Kementerian terkait.
Sehingga dapat disimpulkan secara teknis
hal ini sudah tercapai namun dalam tingkat
yang belum optimal.
Ketiga, sesuai dengan bidang
kewenangan pemerintah daerah (kerja sama
ekonomi, sosial budaya, dan kerja sama
lainnya); kebijakan LEZ sebagai hasil
paradiplomasi Jakarta dengan C40 tentu
merupakan sebuah kerja sama yang
menunjang kualitas hidup masyarakat
Jakarta sendiri. Pengoptimalan kualitas
udara tentu menunjang lingkungan hidup
masyarakat 228uet  untuk dapat menjalan
hari-hari dan rutinitasnya dengan kondisi
tubuh yang fit dan optimal. Sehingga, dapat
disimpulkan kebijakan LEZ sesuai dengan
Peraturan Ment eri Luar Negeri Nomor
09/A/KP/XII/2006/01 yang merinci bidang
kerja sama yang dapat dilakukan pemerintah
daerah, dengan lingkungan hidup
merupakan salah satu di dalamnya.
Keempat, dalam PP Nomor 28 Tahun
2018, Pasal 23, ayat (1), disebutkan bahwa
Kepala Daerah adalah yang berhak untuk
bertindak untuk dan atas nama daerah
sebagai perwakilan daerah dalam
melaksanakan kerja sama luar negeri,
terlihat prinsip ini juga telah dipenuhi Jakarta.
Anies Baswedan, yang kala itu masih
menjabat menjadi Gubernur, yang
menginisiasi juga mempresentasikan
kebijakan LEZ dalam pertemuan steering
committee C40. Anies Baswedan, yang
adalah Gubernur juga perwakilan Jakarta
telah bertindak juga melaksanakan tugasnya
sebagai wakil Jakarta dalam panganggung
paradiplomasi Jakarta dengan C40.
Sehingga dapat disimpulkan bahwa prinsip
ini telah dipenuhi oleh paradiplomasi
Jakarta.

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.54


229

Dalam mengimplementasikan LEZ
sebagai sebuah kebijakan lingkungan di
Kota Tua dan Tebet Eco Park, Pemprov DKI
Jakarta menggunakan jaringan diplomasi
yang Pemprov DKI Jakarta miliki. Pemprov
DKI Jakarta turut menggandeng C40
sebagai panggung diplomasi kota bersama
dengan WRI Indonesia dan ITDP Indonesia
sebagai organisasi non -pemerintah. Dalam
melangsungkan paradiplomasinya -pun,
Jakarta terbukti telah memenuhi prinsip -
prinsip paradiplomasi sesuai yang telah
dirumuskan oleh Ali Takdir Mukti dalam
bukunya Paradiplomasi dan Isu Kedaulatan
di Indonesia.
Pada tahun 2021, Anies Baswedan,
Gubernur yang kala itu menjabat sebagai
perwakilan Jakarta dalam pertemuan Cities
40 (C40), memaparkan kebijakan Low
Emission Zone  untuk dilakukan di Jakarta.
Kebijakan ini didasari oleh undang -undang
yang berlaku yang diatur dalam Perarutan
Gubernur No. 90 Tahun 2021. Anies
memaparkan kebijakan ini dalam sebuah
pertemuan steering committee meeting C40
pada tahun yang sama, kebijakan ini juga
menjadi bagian dari climate action plan yang
sudah disusun oleh Jakarta sebagai anggota
dari C40 (Wiryono & Patnistik, 2021).
Hal ini mendapatkan sambutan yang
baik dari C40, ditambah Low Emission Zone
merupakan salah satu kebijakan strategis
yang direkomendasikan oleh C40 dalam
memperbaiki kualitas udara yang telah
rusak. Selain itu, tidak ada 229uet o229 lain
bagi C40 untuk membatalkan perencanaan
Jakarta dalam melakukan kebijakan Low
Emission Zone dikarenakan keterikatan C40
yang tidak memiliki hak dalam
mengintervensi kebijakan daerah Jakarta
dan kota-kota lainnya. Bagaimanapun juga,
kebijakan ini sejalan dengan visi -misi C40
dalam menjaga tatanan lingkungan global
dengan menjaga kenaikan suhu bum i
sebesar 1.5°C.
C40 juga menunjukkan dukungannya
dalam sebuah aksi melalui jaringan kota baru
yang merupakan produk kerja sama antara
Cities 40, Bloomberg Philantrophies, dan
Clean Air Fund 229uet o229 Breathe Cities.
Jaringan kota ini mengundang Jakarta untuk
turut menjadi bagian dari Breathe Cities,
sehingga membantu Jakarta dalam
menyempurnakan kebijakan Low Emission
Zone yang terbilang masih cukup baru.
Bantuan yang diberikan pun terbilang
lengkap, mulai dari bantuan dana dengan
total $30 juta hingga bantuan -bantuan
teknis, berupa (Breathe Cities, 2024):
• Data oriented: memberikan bantuan
pengumpulan data sebagai bahan
pengambilan keputusan nantinya.
Data yang dikumpulkan merupakan
data kualitas udara 229uet  dengan

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.54


230
teknologi terkini dan juga
pengaadaan riset untuk mencapai
akar masalah dari rusaknya kualitas
udara itu sendiri.
• Raising awareness: membantu kota
dalam meningkatkan awareness
masyarakat sekitar dengan
melibatkan organisasi dan komunitas
230uet  untuk menciptakan bantuan
publik yang ditargetkan kepada
mereka yang terdampak dari
buruknya kualitas udara (contoh: ibu
hamil, bayi, lansia).
• Policymaking supporter: memberikan
bantuan teknis dan juga membangun
kapasitas daerah dalam
mengidentifikasi, mengembangkan
dan mengimplementasikan kebijakan
yang tepat dalam menjawab
permasalahan emisi GRK.
• Connect cities : Breathe Cities juga
memberikan diri sebagai penyedia
panggung bagi para kota dalam
mempresentasikan hasil pekerjaan
mereka di mana nantinya kota -kota
lain dapat membandingkannya
dengan apa yang telah mereka buat
dan bersama menyempurnakan
kebijakan-kebijakan tersebut untuk
hasil yang lebih baik.
Breathe Cities sendiri baru
ditampilkan kepada khalayak umum pada
akhir 2023, dan implementasinya sendiri
akan dimulai pada tahun 2024. Rekam jejak
Breathe Cities sendiri terlihat menjanjikan,
dengan program mereka sebelumnya,
Breathe London dan Breathe Warsaw,
menghasilkan hasil yang memuaskan
bahkan diakui oleh masing -masing
perwakilan kota.
Dalam implementasinya sendiri,
kebijakan LEZ di Jakarta terbilang belum
berjalan dengan 230 uet o . Hal ini
dikarenakan, masih kurangnya kajian
panduan LEZ di Jakarta, inilah yang
mengakibatkan mengapa kebijakan LEZ di
Jakarta nampaknya tidak menghasilkan
dampak signifikan dalam memperbaiki
kualitas udara Jakarta. Dalam wawancara
penulis, pihak DLH mengatakan bahwa DLH
DKI Jakarta pada tahun ini sedang
mengusung kajian untuk memutuskan
apakah LEZ akan terus dikembangkan atau
lebih baik dihentikan saja. Selain itu, kajian
ini juga berguna untuk memberikan definisi
yang jelas mengenai kebijakan LEZ di
Indonesia sendiri dikarenakan masih
banyaknya definisi yang bercampur antara
banyak pihak (Jakarta, 2024).
Di bawah kepemimpinan Gubernur
Anies Baswedan, Jakarta aktif berpartisipasi
dalam C40. Pemprov telah mendorong
pelaksanaan kebijakan revitalisasi seperti
transformasi Kota Tua menjadi 230uet o230

rendah emisi dan penerapan inisiatif
pemulihan hijau di rumah sakit. Selain itu,
Pemprov juga mendukung agenda diplomasi
kota berbasis lingkungan untuk mengurangi
emisi karbon serta memperbaiki kualitas
udara (Hafizha, et al., 2024).

KESIMPULAN
Implementasi Low Emission Zone (LEZ) oleh
Pemrov DKI Jakarta dapat dilihat sebagai
penerapan praktik -praktif paradiplomasi
yang baik, khususnya dengan kerja sama
yang dibangun dengan C40. Dalam proses
implementasinya, Pemprov DKI Jakarta
menggunakan jaringan diplomasi kota yang
ia miliki bersama dengan Cities 40 atau C40
yang mana  Jakarta menjadi anggotanya.
Banyak bantuan yang diberikan C40 kepada
Jakarta, baik berupa bantuan teknis maupun
bantuan finansial, hal ini dikarenakan
program iklim Jakarta sejalan dengan mis i
yang dirancang oleh C40 dalam menanggapi
isu global, secara khusus kualitas udara
yang buruk.
Bukan hanya C40, Jakarta turut
menggandeng beberapa organisasi non-
govermental (NGO) untuk ikut memberikan
kontribusinya. Beberapa diantaranya adalah
World Resources Indonesia (WRI Indonesia)
dan juga Institute of Transportation and
Development Policy Indonesia (ITDP
Indonesia). Bantuan-bantuan yang diberikan
oleh WRI Indonesia dan ITDP Indonesia
adalah dalam perancangan dan penelitian
dalam mendefinisikan dan 231 uet o 231 c
skema implementasi LEZ di Jakarta.
Bantuan teknis tersebut membantu Jakarta
untuk memahami betul 231uet o 231c yang
akan mereka kerjakan ke depannya. Pihak
DLH DKI Jakarta juga menyebutkan adanya
rapat-rapat yang diselenggarakan bersama
kedua organisasi tersebut dalam membahas
perkembangan kebijakan LEZ.
Atas berbagai pertimbangan, Kota
Tua dan Tebet Eco Park terpilih sebagai area
LEZ di Jakarta. Namun, penelitian ini
menemukan bahwa implementasi LEZ di
Kota Tua dan Tebet Eco Park masih menjadi
sebuah 231uet o231 awal bagi Pemprov DKI
Jakarta, dalam mengambil sebuah kebijakan
lingkungan. Oleh karena itu, masih terdapat
banyak peluang pengembangan untuk
memperoleh hasil yang maksimal, mulai dari
penyusunan implementasi, penempatan
teknologi muktahir guna sebagai ba han
pendataan yang tergambarkan secara real
time, hingga pengawasannya.

Abstract

In order to improve the performance of the trade balance, Indonesia is currently always trying to
diversify the market through the expansion of export markets to non-traditional countries. For this
reason, measuring competitiveness and export efficiency is  crucial to be researched first. This
study aims to measure the competitiveness and efficiency of Indonesia's Non-Oil and Gas Exports
to Non-Traditional Markets period 2016 to 2021 by using the  analysis methods RCA, EPD, X -
Model and Stochastic Frontier An alysis with Gravity Model (SFGM). The results of the analysis
show that based on the results of the competitiveness analysis (RCA) and export performance
using EPD and X-Model, it shows that the competitiveness of Indonesia's non-oil and gas exports
to non-traditional countries is still low or below global competitiveness. Meanwhile, the results of
estimation using the Stochastic Frontier Analysis approach with the Gravity Model (SFGM) show
that the variables of GDP of non-traditional countries, the number of population of non-traditional
countries, Indonesia's GDP, competitiveness (RCA) and the area of non-traditional countries have
a positive and significant effect on Indonesia's exports. Meanwhile, economic distance is
estimated to have a negative and significant influence on Indonesia's non-oil and gas exports.

INTRODUCTION
Indonesia is one of the countries that is open
to trade cooperation with other countries.
Indonesia’s involvement and openness in
trade cooperation is expected to strengthen
the economy through improving export
performance both to the world market and to
partner countries (Hotsawadi and
Widyastutik, 2020). On the other hand, the
commitment to establish trade cooperation
with other countries is also expected to
expand employment, improve economic
quality, accelerate technology transfer, and
increase state revenue which contributes to
improving the country’s economy (Oktaviani
& Novianti, 2014).
 The non -oil and gas sector is a
mainstay sector for Indonesia. This is
strengthened by the component of
Indonesia’s trade balance where the non -oil
and gas sector contributes 40.63% to
Indonesia’s total exports during the period
2019 to 2023. Indonesia’s trade balance in
the non-oil and gas sector was also identified
as consistently experiencing a surplus during
the period from 2019 to 2023. Based on this
description, the results of research
conducted by Harahap & Widyastutik, (2020)
also stated that the non-oil and gas sector is
the prima donna sector for Indonesia’s trade
because the sector is the supporting sector
for Indonesia’s trade balance.
   One of the factors that affects the value of
Indonesia’s exports is import demand from
trading partner countries. Indonesia trade will
occur when there is a price disparity between
the two countries, and excess supply in that
country will be an export component while
excess demand in other countries will be an
import component. The top ten countries
including the classificatio n of Indonesia’s
main trading partners in the non -oil and gas
sector during the period 2016 -2021 are
China, the United States, Jap an, the
European Union, Singapore, India, Malaysia,
South Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand
(WITS, 2022) . Indonesia’ s total export
market share during the period 2016-2020 to
the ten main trading partner countries was
78.84 percent. Referring to Harahap &
Widyastutik, (2020), the ten main trading
partner countries of Indonesia are classified
as traditional markets. Thus, the situation still
shows a pattern of Indonesia’s trade
dependence on traditional countries. High
export dependence will provide vulnerability
to Indonesia’ s trade balance, when major
trading partner countries face shocks.
Indonesia uncertainty, shocks to the
economy, and external and internal
problems faced by major trading partner
countries will hamper Indonesia’s trade
performance (Oktaviani & Novianti, 2014).
Thus, the market expansion strategy or
export market diversification is a crucial goal

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.58

for the current government to anticipate the
negative impact of the pattern of trade
dependence on traditional countries.
Export market diversification is a
strategy carried out by a country to expand
the export market to new partner countries
that have been identified as having not made
trade cooperation commitments both
bilaterally, regionally and multilaterally. This
strategy is an effort that can be made to
increase the volume and value of Indonesia’s
exports in the long term (Hadiyanto, 2015).
Market diversification is also included in the
Ministry of Trade’s strategic plan in the 2020
to 2024 RPJMN. In this case, the
government seeks to work on trade
opportunities to the traditional market while
maintaining Indonesia’s trade performance
to the traditional market.
Several previous studies have
analyzed the diversification of Indonesia’s
exports to non-traditional markets, including
research conducted by Sabaruddin, (2017),
Harahap & Widyastutik, (2020). These
studies carry out clustering methods to
determine and define the meaning and
definition of traditional and non -traditional
countries. The results of the study define that
traditional countries are countries that for 30
to 40 years have consistently been ranked in
the top 15 export destinations of Indonesia .
Meanwhile, non -traditional countries are
countries that are inconsistently ranked in
the top 15 export destinations for Indonesia
for a period of 30 to 40 years.
Base on perspective of the scope of
non-traditional countries, Harahap &
Widyastutik (2020) found that there are 111
countries that are categorized as non -
traditional export market destinations for
Indonesia. These countries are spread
across different regions of the world such as
North and South America (e.g. Canada,
Venezuela, Brazil, and Suriname), Europe
(such as Switzerland, Albania, and Ukraine)
and Africa (including Egypt, Nigeria, Ghana,
Mozambique, and Central Africa). In
addition, countries in As ia and the Middle
East are also included in this category, such
as Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Oman,
Yemen, and Qatar. The Oceania and Pacific
Islands region is also represented by
countries such as Fiji, Papua New Guinea,
Vanuatu, and the Solomon Isla nds. The
designation of these countries as non -
traditional markets reflects the potential for
diversification of export destinations to
reduce dependence on traditional markets,
expand the reach of global trade, and
increase product competitiveness in the
international arena (Harahap & Widyastutik,
2020; Sabaruddin, 2017; Oktaviani &
Drynan, 2000).

In more detail, the research
conducted by Harahap & Widyastutik, (2020)
also uses the Structural Match Index (SMI)
and Demand Index (DI) approaches to
examine the opportunities and potential of
non-traditional countries as a new target
market for Indonesia ’s non -oil and gas
products. The Structural Match Index (SMI)
method is an approach taken to analyze the
compatibility between Indonesia ’s exports
and imports from non -traditional countries.
Meanwhile, the Demand Index (DI) method
is an approach taken to e xamine import
demand opportunities from non -traditional
countries for exports originating from
Indonesia. The higher the value of the SMI
index, the lower the level of compatibility of
Indonesia’s non -oil and gas exports with
imports from non-traditional countries, while
the higher the value of the DI index, the
higher the potential demand of the country
for imported products from Indonesia.
The merger between the results of
the calculation of the Structural Match Index
(SMI) and the Demand Index (DI) obtained
four positions of opportunities and export
potential for Indonesia with non -traditional
countries. Quadrant I is a group of non -
traditional countries that are identified as
having a high SMI value and a high demand
index, meaning that the level of compatibility
between Indonesia’s non-oil and gas exports
and traditional country imports is low, but the
position of import demand in the non-oil and
gas sector is high for exports from the world.
Quadrant II shows a condition where the SMI
index value is low while the DI value is high.
This position indicates that there is a
compatibility between Indonesia ’s non -oil
and gas exports and imports from non -
traditional countries, and import demand
from non-traditional countries is also high for
non-oil and gas products from the world,
including Indonesia. Benchmark III is a
position where non -traditional countries are
identified as having a low SMI index value
while a high DI value. This fact indicates that
Indonesia’s non -oil and gas exports are
compatible with imports from non -traditional
countries. However, the import demand
tends to be low for non-oil and gas products
from Indonesia. Finally, quadrant IV
classifies countries with high SMI and low DI
index values. T his means that the level of
compatibility between Indonesia ’s non -oil
and gas exports and traditional country
imports is low and import demand from these
countries is low.
Non-traditional countries in quadrant
II are potential countries as a new market for
Indonesia’s trade. The country ’s
opportunities and potential as a new market
are reflected in the position where the SMI
index value is low while the DI value is high,
which indicates that there is a match
between Indonesia’s non-oil and gas exports

243

and imports from non -traditional countries,
as well as the import demand of these
countries is also high for non -oil and gas
products from the world, including Indonesia.
Countries in Quadrant III also still have the
potential to be used as new target markets
for Indonesia ’s trade. This is because the
country is identified as having a low SMI
score and a high DI value. The low SMI Index
and high DI provide the fact that Indonesia’s
non-oil and gas exports are compatible with
the non -oil and gas imports of these
countries, but the import demand is relatively
low for non -oil and gas products originating
from Indonesia. There are 39 countries
included in the quadrant III classification of
the SMI and DI indexes, namely Albania,
Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Colombia, Congo,
Rep., Costa Rica, Dominican Republic,
Ecuador, Fiji, Ghana, Guatemala, Jordan,
Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mali,
Mauritania, Mauritius, Montenegro, Morocco,
Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua,
Niger, Paraguay, Peru, Rwanda, Senegal,
Seychelles, South Africa, Sri Lanka,
Tajikistan, Tanzania, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda
dan Ukraine (Harahap & Widyastutik, 2020).
The relatively low demand for non-oil
and gas imports from these countries can be
caused by the situation  where these
countries have obtained export supplies from
other countries, especially countries that are
their permanent partners. Several factors
such as the existence of trade agreements
with other countries, the quality and price of
goods that are more competitive than other
countries, as well as stronger diplomatic and
economic relations are the reasons why the
country supplies non -oil and gas products
from other countries (Ingot & Ulfa, 2023). The
import preferences of these countries are
often influenced by factors such as lower
tariffs, free trade agreements, as well as
strategies for diversifying import sources to
reduce dependence on a single country
(Head & Mayer, 2004; Krugman et al., 2018).
Thus, Indonesia needs to increase the
competitiveness of its  products and
strengthen international trade relations to
increase the demand for its non -oil and gas
imports.
The measurement of the
competitiveness and efficiency of
Indonesia’s non-oil and gas exports to non -
traditional markets is carried out to determine
the position of Indonesia ’s non -oil and gas
products in these countries. This is in line
with research conducted by Hotsawadi &
Widyastutik (2023) which states that
competitiveness analysis using the Revealed
Comparative Advantage (RCA), Export
Product Dynamic (EPD)  and X- Model
methods is a strategic step that can be taken
to determine how Indonesia positions itself in

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.58


244
improving trade performance and optimizing
the benefits of trade cooperation with other
countries. The analysis of the
competitiveness and efficiency of
Indonesia’s non -oil and gas exports in
traditional markets was carried out from the
period 2016 to 2021 using the 2 -Digit SITC
approach. In this case, trade publication data
with the 2-Digit SITC approach has the latest
data until 2021. On the other hand, export
efficiency analysis is also important to be
carried out as a recommendation and
consideration fo r the government in
optimizing the performance of Indonesia ’s
non-oil and gas export trade in traditional
countries. Export efficiency analysis is one of
the important aspects in a country ’s trade
sector. This is because the measurement of
export efficiency has an important role for the
government in determining the
competitiveness of its products in export
destination countries and is expected to be a
stimulus and consideration that can
encourage an increase in the value and
volume of exports in the international market
(Fitriani, 2019).
Research related to export efficiency
was conducted by Alim, (2019), Ravishankar
& M. Stack (2014) to measure how optimally
a country utilizes its economic potential in
export activities. The method used, namely
the Stochastic Forecast Gravity Model
(SFGM) was used. The method combines a
gravitational model, which evaluates trade
flows based on factors such as economic
size and distance between countries, with a
stochastic component that captures random
variability in the data.
However, research related to the
measurement of the competitiveness and
efficiency of Indonesia ’s non -oil and gas
exports to non -traditional countries, which
are included in the quadrant III classification
using the SMI and DI index approaches, has
never been conducted. By conducting a
granular/detailed analysis of the
development of the export perfo rmance of
these superior products, both in terms of
RCA, EPD, X -Model and export efficiency
with the SFGM approach, it is hoped that it
can be an illustration f or the government to
set a strategy and direction for trade policies
that will be carried out to optimize and
maximize these countries as targets for the
expansion or diversification of new export
markets for Indonesia ’s non -oil and gas
sector.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
The measurement of Indonesia’s non-oil and
gas export capacity to non -traditional
markets was analyzed using the Revealed.
Comparative Advantage (RCA), Export
Product Dynamic (EPD) and X -Model
methods. In this case, the Comparative

Advantage (RCA) method is used to
measure or identify the competitiveness
position of Indonesia ’s non -oil and gas
exports in the world in each non -traditional
country. Meanwhile, the Export Product
Dynamic (EPD) and X -Model analysis
methods are used to identify Indonesia ’s
non-oil and gas export performance in each
non-traditional country.
To identify the competitiveness and
performance of Indonesia ’s non-oil and gas
exports to non-traditional countries using the
2-Digit SITC approach except for the SITC
code 33 and 34 classifications sourced from
the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS).
This refers to research conducted by
(Harahap & Widyastutik, 2020) where
Petroleum and petroleum products (STIC 33)
and Gas, natural and manufactured (STIC
34) products are included in the oil and gas
sector classification.
Thus, the products classified as non-
oil and gas sectors include live animals (00);
Meat and processed meat (01); Dairy and
egg products (02); Fish and processed fish
(03); Cereals and processed cereals (04);
Fruits and vegetables (05); Sugar,
processed sugar and honey (06); Coffee,

After measuring the competitiveness
and performance of Indonesia ’s non-oil and
gas exports in each non -traditional country,
an analysis of export efficiency and factors
affecting it was continued. The analysis of
export efficiency and its determinants uses
the Stochastic Frontier Analysis Gravity
Model (SFGM) method. Th e Stochastic
Frontier Analysis Gravity Model (SFGM)
method is an analysis method that integrates
the concepts of Stochastic Frontier Analysis
(SFA) and Gravity Model to understand the
relationship between a country ’s economic
efficiency and trade interactions with other
countries. In this case, the variables used in
the SFGM model include the bound variable
is the export value while the independent
variables are Indonesia ’s Real GDP, Real
GDP of trading partners, number of
population, economic distance, real
exchange rate, RCA index, area of each non-
traditional country and Dummy FTA sourced
from the World Bank, WITS, Herritage and
CEPII.
The stages carried out in this study
are as follows:
1. The measurement of the
competitiveness of Indonesia ’s non- oil
and gas exports to each non- traditional
country classified as quadrant III
according to the research of Harahap &
Widyastutik, (2020) using the Revealed
Comparative Advantage (RCA) 246uet
o246c method. Indonesia’s non-oil and
gas exports to each non -traditional
country use the two -digit SITC
classification approach from 2016 to
2021 as described above.
2. The identification of Indonesia’s non- oil
and gas export performance to each
non-traditional country was analyzed
using the Product Dynamic (EPD) and
X-Model methods. The Product
Dynamic (EPD) and X -Model methods
are quantitative methods that can be
used to identify and measure the
position of Indonesia’s market dynamics
and development to each non-traditional
country.
After measuring the competitiveness and
performance of Indonesia ’s non-oil and gas
exports in each non -traditional country, the
analysis of export efficiency and factors
affecting Indonesia’s non-oil and gas exports
was continued using the Stochastic Frontier
Analysis Gravity Model (SFGM) method.

This analysis aims to analyze how efficient
Indonesia’s non -oil and gas exports are in
each non-traditional country and what factor
have the potential to influence in
encouraging Indonesia’s non -oil and gas
exports to each of these countries.

RESEARCH METHOD
The measurement of Indonesia’s non-oil and
gas export capacity to non -traditional
markets was analyzed using the Revealed
Comparative Advantage (RCA), Export
Product Dynamic (EPD) and X -Model
methods. After measuring the
competitiveness and performance of
Indonesia’s non-oil and gas exports in each
non-traditional country, an analysis of export
efficiency and factors affecting it was
continued. The analysis of export efficiency
and its determinants uses the Stochastic
Frontier Analysis Gravity Model (SFGM)
method.

Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA)
The RCA Index is a method that can be used
to identify the comparative advantage or
export competitiveness of a country in a
commodity to the world. From another
perspective, this study aims to measure and
identify the potential or competitiveness of
Indonesia’s non -oil and gas sector in non -
traditional countries. For this reason,
mathematically, the RCA Index can be
formulated as follows:
𝑅𝐶𝐴	 =
!!"#
!"#"
!!$#
!$##
….............................. (1)
Description:
Xijt : Value of of Indonesia’s Non-Oil and
Gas exports  to non-traditional
country
Xjt : Total value of exports from
Indonesia to non-traditional country
Xiwt : Value of Non-Oil and Gas exports
from the world to non-traditional
country
Xwt : Value of the world ’s total exports to
non-traditional country

Based on the mathematical
calculation above, a country ’s products are
said to have competitiveness in the global
market when the value of the RCA index is
greater than 1 (one). On the other hand, the
products of an identified country do not have
a comparative advantage when the value of
the RCA index is less than 1 (one).

Export Product Dynamic (EPD)
This method is used to identify the
competitiveness of a product whether it is in
dynamic performance or not. The calculation
component using the EPD method consists
of a market attractiveness matrix and
information about the business strength of a
product in other countries. The combination
of the two, both in terms of business strength
and market attractiveness, produces four
character positions of a product, including

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.58


248
positions that indicate that the product ’s
performance is rising star, falling star, lost
opportunity, and retreat.
Product performance in the rising star
character is an ideal market position. This is
because the product is identified as having a
high market share in exports to the
destination country. For the Lost Opportunity
category, products that fall into this
classification are indicated to have a
dynamic decline in market share, as well as
the most unwanted position. The Falling star
category is also not liked, although it is still
better when compared to lost opportunity.
This is because the market share continues
to increase, but then on the other hand it will
experience a significant decrease.
Meanwhile, for the cla ssification of products
that are included in the retreat character.
Meanwhile, retreat is the last character found
in the EPD calculation matrix and is usually
undesirable, but in certain cases it can be
desirable if the movement moves away from
stagnant p roducts and towards dynamic
products (Oktaviani & Amaliah, 2010).

Stochastic Frontier Analysis with Gravity
Model (SFGM)
Stochastic Frontier Analysis with Gravity
Model (SFGM) is an analysis method that
integrates the concepts of Stochastic
Frontier Analysis (SFA) and Gravity Model to
understand the relationship between a
country’s economic efficiency and trade
interactions with other countries. Stochastic
Frontier Analysis is used to measure the
relative efficiency of countries in economic
production, while the Gravity Model is used
to evaluate the extent to which factors such
as economic size and geographical distance
affect trade interactions between countries.
An analytical approach using SFGM is
indicated to be used to gain deeper insights
into how a country’s economic efficiency can
affect its level of global trade interaction.
Factors that affect export efficiency include
transportation costs, trade policies,
infrastructure, political stability, and
technology levels. The model predicts export
flows based on the economic characteristics
of the countries involved, and then compares
these predictions with actual data to as sess
efficiency. Thus, obstacles to efficiency can
be identified and analyzed, providing a basis
for more effective trade policy
recommendations.
  Kalirajan & Singh (2008)  249 uet
o 249 ced the Stochastic Frontier Analysis
(SFA) model by interacting with gravitational
equations aimed at explaining the variety of
trading partners in trade. In this case, the
trade limits estimated through this approach
provide freedom in taking the optimal level of
trade among the countries in the analysis. On
the other hand, the Stochastic Frontier
Analysis (SFA) equation in the trade gravity
model (SFGM) is considered indispensable
in international trade analysis because of its
ability to accurately measure trade efficiency
(Roperto & Edgardo, 2014) . The use of the
SFA model allows the analysis of factors
affecting trade performance by separating
the influence of inefficiency from other
factors affecting trade flows between
countries. Thus this situation indicates that
the SFA not only considers fact ors such as
distance, economic size, and trade barriers
in the gravity model, but also identifies the
level of efficiency of the country in
harnessing its trade potential (Stack, 2014).
Deluna and Cruz (2014).
The research on the efficiency and
determinants of Indonesia’s non-oil and gas
exports to non -traditional markets uses
variables bound by export value while the
independent variables are Indonesia ’s Real
GDP, Real GDP of trading partners,
population, economic distance, real
exchange rate, RCA index, area of each non-
traditional country and Dummy FTA. Thus,

Based on the description above,
export efficiency is a comparison between
the actual export value and its potential.
Export efficiency is important in the aspect of
international trade. Noviyani & Muid (2019)
and Amstrong (2007)  stated that if the
difference between the actual and potential
export value is getting smaller, then a country
has carried out its trade in the most efficient
way and vice versa. The export efficiency
interval is at 0-1, the closer to 1, the smaller
the gap between actual and potential exports
or the more efficient the trade carried out by
Indonesia with partner countries and vice
versa.

RESULT AND DISCUSSION
Competitiveness and Performance of
Indonesia’s Non -Oil and Gas Exports in
Non-Traditional Markets
In an effort to encourage an increase in
Indonesia’s exports, identification of power
and export performance is the main thing that
must be done.  The importance of
competitiveness analysis aims to provide an
in-depth understanding of a product ’s
competitive position in the international
market and become the basis for effective
policies and strategies to increase exports
(Retnaningsih et al., 2024; Manalu, D.S.T.,
et.al, 2022).
The results of the analysis using RCA
identified that the competitiveness of
Indonesia’s Non-Oil and Gas exports to non-
traditional countries is still low or below
global competitiveness. The lack of
competitiveness of Indonesia ’s Non-Oil and
Gas exports to non -traditional markets is
shown by the results of the calculation of the
RCA Index of less than one.
In terms of export performance, the
results of the analysis using the Export
Product Dynamic (EPD) approach identified
that the dynamics of Indonesia’s non-oil and
gas export performance to non -traditional
countries are in a retreat position. Retreat is
a product that has poor export performance
and low competitiveness. This product tends
to decline both in terms of export volume and
in terms of acceptance in the international
market ( Kim, 1982) . Thus, the position of
non-oil and gas export performance that
retreats to Non-Traditional Markets indicates
that Indonesia must strive to carry out policy
strategies that can encourage increased
profitability through improving product
quality, innovation , product diversification
and strengthening marketing strategies in
these countries.

Based on the description above, the
results of the analysis using the X -model
identified that the development position of
Indonesia’s non-oil and gas export market is
on average in a position to develop a market
with less potential. Of the 39 countries
analyzed, 37 of them show that Indonesia’s
non-oil and gas export market development
position is in a phase of less potential.
However, for the Guatemala and Peru,
Indonesia’s non-oil and gas export position is
recorded as being in an optimistic market
development phase. Market development
that lacks potential is a big challenge for
Indonesia’s exports. For this reason, one of
the steps that can be taken to overcome this
problem is to study more deeply the position
of Indonesia’s non -oil and gas export
efficiency. The government also needs to
increase international cooperation and
expand market access through free trade
agreements that can provide tariff
preferences for Indonesia products.

Efficiency of Indonesia’s Non-Oil and Gas
Exports to Each Non-Traditional Country
The Stochastic Frontier Gravity Model
(SFGM) is a model used in this study to
estimate and measure export efficiency. The
value of export efficiency is on a scale of 0 to
1 or 0 percent to 100 percent. If 0 means
inefficiency and 1 means efficient. In this
study, there was an adjustment in the
number of countries analyzed from 39
countries to 28 countries. This is 252uet o
the inadequate availability of data from
several countries such as Cameroon,
Albania, Mali, Tajikistan, Nepal, Niger,
Rwanda, Uganda, Namibia and Lesotho, so
that these countries are not continued for
their efficiency analysis.

Based on the analysis, it was found
that the average value of Indonesia ’s export
efficiency to non -traditional market areas in
2016-2021 was 55.954 percent (Table 3).
This position indicates that Indonesia has still
not reached its potential condition of 44,046
percent.  From the perspective of each
country, it was identified that the highest
efficiency of Indonesia’s non -oil and gas
exports was in Togo with an average of
89,297 percent from 2016 to 2021. Then the
second and third positions are in Mauritania
and South Africa with an average efficiency
of Indonesia’s non -oil and  gas exports of
84,884 percent and 80,232 percent during
the period 2016 and 2021.
However, the results of the efficiency
analysis using the Stochastic Frontier
Gravity Model (SFGM) analysis method
recorded that the efficiency position of
Indonesia’s non -oil and gas exports in 20
countries is below 70 percent, meaning that
Indonesia’s trade performance has not been
able to be carried out efficiently with these
countries. The 20 countries include Fiji,
Jordan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Ghana, Peru,
Chile, Mozambique, Ukraine, Madagascar,
Dominican Republic, Colombia, Ecuador,
Tunisia, Guatemala,  Morocco, Seychelles,
Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Paraguay. Given
that non -oil and gas exports are the main
sectors that contribute positively to
Indonesia’s trade balance, the government
must conduct policy mapping to encourage
increased exports, quality and market
diversification to non -traditional countries.
This is because until now Indonesia’s non-oil
and gas exports are still dependent on
several countries such as China, the United
States, the European Union and India where
these countries are tradition al countries
(Harahap & Widyastutik, 2020). For this
reason, the next stage of this study is the
identification and mapping of factors that
affect Indonesia’s non-oil and gas exports to
non-traditional countries.

Determinants of Indonesia's Non -Oil and
Gas Exports to Non-Traditional Countries
Estimation of the determinants of Indonesia's
non-oil and gas exports to non -traditional
countries uses the stochastic frontier gravity
model method version of the technical
efficiency model. Based on the results of the
estimation, it was obtained that the variables
of GDP of non -traditional countries,
population of non-traditional countries, GDP
of Indonesia, competitiveness (RCA) and
area of non -traditional countries have a
positive and significant effect on Indonesia's
non-oil and gas exports. Meanwhile,  the

Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.58


254
economic distance between Indonesia and
non-traditional countries is estimated to have
a negative and significant effect on
Indonesia's non-oil and gas exports.  Based
on the description above, the estimation
results show that Indonesia's GDP variable
is a variable that has a large coefficient in
influencing non-oil and gas exports to non -
traditional markets. Indonesia's GDP
variable coefficient of 2,157 shows that  an
increase in Indonesia's GDP by 1 percent will
encourage an increase in Indonesia's non-oil
and gas exports to non-traditional markets by
2,157 percent. The results of this estimate
are in line with research conducted by Irhami
(2015) and Tumwebaze Karamuriro (2015)
which stated that Indonesia's GDP has a
positive relationship and has a significant
influence on Indonesia's exports.

GDP and Population of Non -
Traditional Countries are also estimated to
have a positive and significant influence on
Indonesia's non -oil and gas exports with
coefficients of 0.306 and 0.339, respectively.
Hotsawadi & Widyastutik (2023)  Stated that
the variable Approach of the GDP variable of
Non-Traditional countries indicates the state
of people's purchasing power in the country.
Thus, an increase in GDP and Population of
Non-Traditional Countries by 1 percent will
encourage an increase in Indonesia's non-oil
and gas exports by 0.306 percent and 0.339
percent. The results of this estimate are also
in line with the results of research conducted
by Kahfi (2016) , Ravishankar & M. Stack,
(2014) which stated that the GDP of partner
countries has a significant and positive effect
on export value. Then, Wardani & Mulatsih
(2018) also discussed that the population of
trading partner countries is significant and
positively affects the value of Indonesia's
exports.
The competitiveness variable (RCA)
and the area of non-traditional countries also
have a positive effect on Indonesia's non -oil
and gas exports. This is in line with the
results of research conducted by Miftah
Akbar & Widyastutik, 2022) which stated that
the power index (RCA) has a positive and
significant effect on Indonesia's exports.
Meanwhile, economic distance is predicted
to have a negative and significant effect on
Indonesia's non-oil and gas exports. This is
also in line with the  results of research

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)

255

conducted by Noviyani & Muid (2019)  and
Wenhui et al., (2022)  which found that
economic distance has a negative and
significant relationship with Indonesia's
exports.
CONCLUSION
Based on the description above, several
things can be concluded in this study,
namely (1) based on the results of
competitiveness analysis (RCA) and export
performance using EPD and X -Model show
that the competitiveness of Indonesia's non-
oil and gas expor ts to non -traditional
countries is still low or below global
competitiveness. The lack of
competitiveness of Indonesia's Non -Oil and
Gas exports to non -traditional markets is
shown by the results of the calculation of the
RCA Index of less than 1. In terms of export
performance, the results of the analysis
using the Export Product Dynamic (EPD)
approach identified that the dynamics of
Indonesia's non -oil and gas export
performance to non-traditional countries are
in a retreat position. This means  that it has
poor export performance and low
competitiveness. (2) Based on the analysis
carried out, the average value of Indonesia's
export efficiency to non -traditional market
areas in 2016 -2021 was 55.954 percent.
This position shows Indonesia's low ability to
efficiently export non-oil and gas products to
non-traditional countries. On the other hand,
the results of the efficiency analysis using the
Stochastic Frontier Gravity Model (SFGM)
analysis method also noted that the
efficiency position of Indonesia's non-oil and
gas exports in 20 countries is below 70
percent, meaning that Indonesia's trade
performance has not been able to be carried
out efficiently with these countries. The 20
countries include Fiji, Jordan, Senegal, Sri
Lanka, Ghana, Peru, Chile, Mozambique,
Ukraine, Madagascar, Dominican Republic,
Colombia, Ecuador, Tunisia, Guatemala,
Morocco, Seychelles, Costa Rica,
Nicaragua, and Paraguay. (3) Based on the
results of the estimation, it was obtained that
the variables of GDP of non -traditional
countries, population of non -traditional
countries, GDP of Indonesia,
competitiveness (RCA) and area of non -
traditional countries have a positive and
significant effect on Indonesia's non -oil and
gas exports. Meanwhile, the economic
distance between Indonesia and non -
traditional countries is estimated to have a
negative and significant effect on Indonesia's
non-oil and gas exports.

POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the results of the research, a
number of policies are needed that are
expected to be the first step in improving the
performance of Indonesia's non-oil and gas

exports to non -traditional countries. The
government needs to increase the
competitiveness of export products through
the development of high -value-added
products, production efficiency, and quality
improvement in accordance with
international standards. Fiscal incentives
and technological research support should
be given to export-oriented industries. Export
product diversification strategies also need
to focus on potential commodities with high
demand in countries such as Fiji, Senegal,
and Peru, as well as superior products such
as processed foods, textiles, and electronics.
For this reason, the government must
improve logistics efficiency by strengthening
transportation infrastructure, reducing
shipping costs, and improving trade
connectivity to minimize the negative impact
of the economic distance between Indonesia
and destination countries.
Strengthening bilateral and
multilateral cooperation is a priority, through
negotiations on the elimination of tariffs and
non-tariff barriers with non -traditional
countries such as Tunisia, Colombia, and
Mozambique. In addition, marketing
strategies throu gh active participation in
international trade exhibitions and trade
missions need to be improved to introduce
Indonesian products and must also be
supported by increasing the capacity of
human resources through technical training
related to export managem ent, market
research, and product quality standards
must be implemented so that exporters are
more competitive.

Abstract

The Republic of Indonesia and South Korea have engaged in a bilateral cooperation spanning 50
years across diverse domains. Despite the success of this collaboration in augmenting the overall
trade between the two nations in alignment with their initial economic objectives, the trajectory of
trade development has not consistently followed a linear pattern. This study aims to elucidate the
trading dynamics between Indonesia and South Korea from 201 3 to 2022. This period was
selected as it reflects significant dynamics in bilateral trade relations as well as global economic
fluctuations that influenced the trade patterns of both countries. T his is achieved through a
comprehensive analysis utilizing methodologies such as the Grubel-Lloyd Index, Trade Balance
Index (TBI), Trade Complementarity Index (TCI), and Revealed Symmetric Comparative
Advantage Index (RSCA). The research outcomes reveal a hi gh degree of industrial
interrelatedness within 10 commodity groups, with 7 exhibiting robust integration and 3 displaying
varying degrees of integration ranging from moderate to weak. Despite the sustained high level
of compatibility in the trade structure, discernible fluctuations are observed in trade surpluses and
deficits. The analysis of the Revealed Symmetric Compa rative Advantage Index highlights the
absence of significant comparative advantages for Indonesia across the majority of the analyzed
commodities. Notwithstanding marginal alterations in the Product Mapping classification,
statistical analyses of (IIT), TB I, TCI, and RSCA underscore bilateral trade's nuanced and
dynamic nature, with annual fluctuations necessitating focused attention.

INTRODUCTION
In supporting domestic needs
fulfillment and addressing the challenges of
globalization, every country engages in
cooperation with other countries in various
fields. Humans, as social beings, need to
collaborate in efforts to meet their living
needs, and the same applies to these
countries. Without this cooperation, a country
may have to strive to produce everything on
its own and face difficulties in accessing
products that are difficult to produce locally
(Li, 2017). The development of the global
economy has driven countries to seek new
ways to enhance international trade
cooperation (Hesti, 2023). One form of
international cooperation between countries
is bilateral cooperation, which involves two
countries in various fields. The Republic of
Indonesia has engaged in bilateral
cooperation with the Republic of South Korea
for 50 years, which has implic ations in
various fields including politics -security,
economy, and socio -cultural aspects.
Bilateral economic relations between
Indonesia and South Korea were first started
in 1973 and have continued to this day and
have experienced various degrees of
progress and impacts for the two countries
(Salsa Bila & Wijayati, 2022).

Cooperation. Source: Ministry of Foreign Affairs
of Indonesia (Author's Summary)

International trade is crucial for
economic efficiency and fostering
international relations. Indonesia and South
Korea established diplomatic relations in
September 1973, with consular relations
dating back to August 1966 (Rompas, 2019).
Initially, this cooperation was based on
Indonesia's natural resources and labor, and
South Korea's capital and technology. Over
time, these relations expanded into various
fields, including energy, environment,
agriculture, economy, defense, tourism, and
culture. In 2006, bilateral cooperation aimed
at accelerating industrialization in Indonesia
began. In 2011, the Indonesia -Korea
Comprehensive Economic Partnership
Agreement (IK -CEPA) was signed to
strengthen trade relations.
In 2012, Indonesia and South Korea
agreed to establish the Indonesia -South
Korea Comprehensive Economic
Partnership (IK-CEPA). IK-CEPA was signed
on December 18, 2020, in Seoul, South
Korea. With regulations on the Certificate of
Origin (SKA) governed by R egulation of the

Minister of Trade No. 57 of 2022 (Ministry of
Trade of the Republic of Indonesia, 2022).
The Indonesia -Korea Comprehensive
Economic Partnership Agreement (IK -
CEPA) has become one of the strategic
economic collaborations that can provide
new opportunities for economic growth,
trade, and investment between Indonesia
and South Korea (Santoso, 2022). Through
IK-CEPA, Indonesia is poised to secure
market access for 95.5% of South Korea's
tariff lines, accounting for a market share of
97.33% (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the
Republic of Indonesia, 2018).
The Republic of South Korea is one
of Indonesia's major trading partners. From
2013 to 2022, trade between Indonesia and
South Korea fluctuated in line with both
developments between the two nations and
global economic trends. The trade between
both countr ies experienced the largest
decline in 2014 & 2020. According to data
from the Indonesian Ministry of Trade, the
trade volume between Indonesia and South
Korea experienced a decline due to the
weakening global economy, which was felt
by many countries worldwide. (Pratiwi,
2019). During this period the COVID -19
pandemic in 2019–2020 further disrupted the
global economy, leading to a worldwide
recession. These global economic dynamics,
alongside other factors, contributed to the
fluctuations in trade between Indonesia and
South Korea during this period (Arianto,
2020).

Balance 2013-2022 (US$). Source: UN
COMTRADE

In Figure 2, it is apparent that from
2013 to 2022, the trade balance between
Indonesia and South Korea tended to exhibit
a deficit for Indonesia, with the trade volume
also showing fluctuations reflecting trade
imbalance. Indonesia achieved a trade
surplus only in 2017 -2018 and 2022 during
this period. Fluctuations reflecting trade
imbalance occurred during this period, with
Indonesia achieving a trade surplus only in
2017-2018 and 2022. From 2013 to 2017,
the trade trend experienced a decline.
However, following the agreement to elevate
the bilateral relationship from a "strategic
partnership" to a "special strategic
partnership" in November 2017, the trade
trend began to improve at the start of 2018.
This shift in the partnership status likely
contributed to renewed efforts to strengthen

263

economic ties and trade relations, resulting
in an upward trajectory in bilateral trade
moving forward (Rompas, 2019). The
combination of these factors provides a
dynamic context that allows for an in -depth
analysis of how both global economic shifts
and b ilateral trade agreements have
impacted the trade balance between the two
countries.

conditions mentioned above are of interest
because bilateral cooperation between
Indonesia and South Korea has the potential
to boost the total trade between both
countries. However, trade developments do
not always result in consistent improvements.
Therefore, this research aims to delve into
this matter by examining the position and
potential of trade in the context of the
international trade cooperation relationship
between Indonesia and South Korea from
2013 to 2022.
The research focus includes the
analysis of trends and performance in intra -
industry trade, trade balance, product
competitiveness, and the suitability of trade
structures. In this study. The analysis is
conducted using an aggregate SITC
(Standard International Trade Classification)
perspective that utilizes 1 -digit codes (0 -9).
SITC is a system developed by the United
Nations to categorize and classify traded
products based on their material composition
and economic function, rather than their
physical cha racteristics. The SITC
classification system allows for a systematic
approach to analyzing trade data, facilitating
comparisons across countries and time
periods. By using the 1 -digit classification,
the analysis focuses on broad categories of
goods, making it easier to examine general
trade patterns and trends between Indonesia
and South Korea during the specified period.
This approach provides valuable insights into
the overall structure of trade and the types of
goods driving the bilateral trade flows.  From
the aforementioned background, the author
attempts to formulate several research
questions as follows:
1. What is the potential for intra -industry
trade between Indonesia and South
Korea during the period of 2013-2022?
2. How is the suitability of the trade structure
between Indonesia and South Korea, as
measured by the Trade Complementarity
Index?
3. What is the historical development of the
bilateral trade balance between Indonesia
and South Korea, measured by the Trade
Balance Index from 2013 to 2022?
4. What is the position and dynamics of
Indonesia's leading commodities with
comparative advantages in the South
Korean market through the analysis of
Revealed Symmetric Comparative
Advantage (RSCA) during the period of
2013-2022?
How is the framework of trade
positions and comparative advantages
formed through the application of Product
Mapping in identifying the trade positions of
Indonesia and South Korea?

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
Importance of International Trade and
Theories
In analyzing Indonesia-Korea trade, relevant
trade theories such as Adam Smith's theory
of absolute advantage, David Ricardo's
theory of comparative advantage, and the
Heckscher-Ohlin (H -O) theory provide a
robust framework for understanding the
dynamics of trade relations between the two
countries. Each of these theories focuses on
differences in production factors and
efficiency in producing goods, which forms
the foundation for analyzing the flow of
international trade. A country may not be
able to meet its needs solely by relying on its
resources due to the diverse human needs,
which is one of the reasons a country
engages in trade with others (gains from
trade). Almost no country remains isolated
without relations with others, as stated by
Dumairy in 1997 (as cited  in Kemendag,
2010).
Krugman’s theory (1991) suggests
the main reasons for international trade are
differences among countries and the pursuit
of economies of scale. International trade
theory and policy fall under the
microeconomic aspects of international
economics as they relate to individual
countries treated as single units and the
relative prices of commodities. On the other
hand, because the balance of payments
concerns total receipts and payments and
adjustment policies affect national income
levels and general price in dices, these
illustrate the macroeconomic aspects of
international economics (Salvatore, 1997:6).
According to Adam Smith's classical
economic theory, a nation's wealth is not
measured by precious metals but by GDP
and the contribution of foreign trade to GDP
formation. To increase GDP and foreign
trade, the government needs to establish
free trade, which fosters intense competition
and encourages countries to specialize
based on absolute advantage, occurring
when a country produces goods or services
that other countries cannot.
The Heckscher -Ohlin (H -O) theory
states that a country will export commodities
produced by cheap and abundant factors of
production and import commodities whose
factors are relatively scarce and expensive
domestically. Meanwhile, David Ricardo's
comparative advantage theory explains that
in trade, comparative advantage occurs
when a country produces goods or services
at a relatively lower cost than other countries.
Lancaster (1980) shows that intra -industry
trade occurs even when economies are
identical in every aspect and can persist
under comparative advantage conditions.
According to Helpman and Krugman (1999),

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.53


266
as cited in Hoang's 2019 research,
comparative advantage drives inter -industry
trade by encouraging trade specialization,
while economies of scale spur intra -industry
trade.
Classical theory was pioneered and
developed by Adam Smith and subsequently
enhanced by other scholars, including Adam
Smith, David Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill.
The classical theory of comparative
advantage explains that international trade is
possible due to differences in labor
productivity (explicitly stated as a factor of
production) among countries (Salvatore,
2004). Adam Smith criticized the mercantilist
view of international trade, which he saw as
excessive government intervention. Smith
argued that if a country adopts the laissez -
faire principle domestically and engages in
free trade with other nations, its wealth will
increase. This is similarly true for other
countries when there is an international
division of labor (specialization). This will
expand the market for produced goods and
lead to international specialization. With
specialization, the consumption of goods and
services will increase as each country
focuses on producing specific goods
according to its advantages. A country will
have an absolute advantage if it chooses to
specialize in production and export goods
which it has an absolute advantage, and
import goods which it has an absolute
disadvantage.
David Ricardo's theory of
international trade states that in a situation of
free trade, even if a country is less efficient
than another in producing both goods, both
countries can still engage in mutually
beneficial trade. The first country should
specialize in  producing the commodity in
which its absolute disadvantage is smaller,
which is known as comparative advantage.
Conversely, it should import the commodity
in which its absolute disadvantage is larger,
referred to as comparative disadvantage
(Salvatore, 2013). When a commodity has a
greater comparative advantage, the country
has the opportunity to produce and export it.
Conversely, commodities with smaller
comparative advantages should be imported
(Salvatore, 1997). Comparative advantage
can be achieved by increasing the
productivity of a commodity or product. Cost
comparative advantage is a component of
comparative advantage. A country achieves
high productivity by combining factors of
production efficiently, resulting in the ability
to produce better and r elatively cheaper
products, thereby gaining a cost comparative
advantage.
According to the Heckscher-Ohlin (H-
O) Model, international trade occurs due to
differences in the ownership of production

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)
https://doi.org/10.70836/jh.v9i2.53


267

factors among countries, even if their
technology levels are the same. A country
with an abundance of capital will focus on
producing and exporting capital -intensive
goods. Conversely, a country with an
abundance of labor will specialize in
producing and e xporting labor -intensive
goods. Thus, international trade arises from
these differences in the ownership of
production factors, despite comparable
technology levels. Several concepts have
been developed within this theory.
International trade is not fundam entally
different from inter -regional trade, with
distance being the primary distinction. The
traded goods are based on the proportions
and intensities of the production factors used
to produce them. The theory posits that a
country should produce goods that utilize its
relatively abundant or cheap production
factors. As a result, the production costs of
these goods will be relatively low. By
extensively using these relatively abundant
production factors, their prices will increase.
The H -O theory uses the isocost curve,
representing equal total production costs,
and the isoquant curve, representing equal
total production. Equilibrium occurs when the
isocost curve intersects with the isoquant
curve, indicating optimal production at a
certain cost.
In this context, a country's production
is not only based on comparative advantage
but also involves participation in trade within
similar industrial sectors, leading to the
emergence of the New Trade Theory (NTT)
as a response to some limitations of the
Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) model. Criticisms of
the H -O theory include its questionable
empirical validation and the foundational
assumptions that fail to reflect reality. One
major criticism that NTT addresses is related
to the homogeneity of traded goods.
According to New Trade Theory, almost all
modern economies no longer produce
homogeneous goods but instead
manufacture a variety of products with
significant differences. Even within a single
product category, there can be substantial
variation. Consequently, international trade
involves the exchange of diverse products,
both within the same industry and across
different industries. This differentiated
product exchange is referred to as intra -
industry trade (IIT). IIT is a key aspect of the
New Trade Theory (Usman et al., 2010).
The main difference between intra -
industry trade and inter-industry trade is that
the latter involves entirely different products,
while intra -industry trade involves products
that are essentially similar but differ in certain
aspects. Grubel and Lloyd's (1975) theory
conceptualizes two -way trade within the

Jurnal Hubungan Luar Negeri
Vol. 9 No. 2 (July – December 2024)

268
same industry, explaining the phenomenon
of intra -industry trade among countries
engaged in exporting and importing similar
goods. This concept was further developed
by Greenaway and Milner (1994), who
classified intra-industry trade into two types:
horizontal intra -industry trade (between
countries with similar products) and vertical
intra-industry trade (between countries with
products differing in quality and technological
advantages). According to the Ministry of
Trade (2010), IIT originates from the th eory
of comparative advantage, where a country
with a comparative advantage in a specific
commodity exports that commodity and
imports goods in which it does not have a
comparative advantage. Intra -industry trade
plays a significant role, especially in the trade
of manufactured goods among advanced
industrial nations, which dominate global
trade. Intra -industry trade tends to occur
between countries with similar labor modal
ratios and skill levels (Amalia et al., 2018). In
other words, intra -industry trade becomes
stronger when countries are at similar levels
of economic development.

RESEARCH METHOD
The object of this research is the bilateral
trade between Indonesia and South Korea
during the period of 2013 -2022. Within this
framework, the research will analyze the flow
of trade in goods between the two countries
using the 1-digit aggregate SITC perspective.
The objects of the research are the Intra -
Industry Trade Index (IIT), Trade Balance
Index (TBI), Trade Complementarity Index
(TCI), and Revealed Symmetric
Comparative Advantage (RSCA).
Furthermore, the analysis will be conducted
using a product mapping scheme by
classifying based on TBI and RSCA.
Additionally, descriptive statistical analysis
will be employed to depict the data in
formations that are easier to interpret. The
subject of this study is the trade balance
between Indonesia and South Korea from
2013 to 2022. Thus, the object of this
research will provide valuable insights into
the trade relationship between Indonesia and
South Korea during the examined period.
Intra-Industry Trade Index (IIT)
In depicting the trade interdependence between
the two countries, an analysis of Intra -Industry
Trade (IIT) is conducted. To assess the level of
integration occurring between the involved
countries, the IIT index is derived through the
calculation of the Grubel-Lloyd index from trade
data obtained from UN Comtrade ( United
Nations Commodity Trade ) with SITC
aggregate 1 -digit codes. The calculation of
IIT follows the method developed by Grubel-
Lloyd (1971; 1975) and Greenaway & Milner
(1983).  The process is as follows:

Trade Balance Index (TBI)
The Trade Balance Index is used to depict
and analyze whether a country specializes in
exporting or importing specific commodities
with its trading partners (Lafay, 1992). Simply
put, the Trade Balance Index has the
following formula:
Explanation:
Xij  = Export of commodity j to the world
by country i
Min  = Import of commodity j from the
world by country i
The trade balance index (TBIij )
represents the trade balance of country I for a
group of products (SITC) j, where xij and mij
denote the exports and imports of a group of
products j by country i, respectively. The index
values range from -1 to +1. Specifically, the TBI
equals -1 if a country only imports, while it equals
+1 if a count ry only exports. However, the index
is not defined when a country neither exports nor
imports. In such cases, we assign a value of zero,
indicating that the group of products has potential
for either export or import. Any value between -1
and +1 indicates that the country simultaneously
exports and imports a commodity. A country is
termed a "net importer" in a specific group of
products when the TBI value is negative, and
a "net exporter" when the TBI value is
positive (Widodo, 2009).

Trade Complementarity Index (TCI)
The Trade Complementarity Index can
provide insight into the prospects of intra -
regional trade and indicate the compatibility
of a country's import structure with its trading
partners' exports. This index indicates
whether two trading countries have
complementary export and import structures
or the opposite (Drysdale, 1967). To
measure the level of trade complementarity
between two countries, the Trade
Complementarity Index can be utilized
(Khadan & Hosein, 2016). The formulation
used is:
𝑻𝑪𝑰 = 𝟏𝟎𝟎	 K𝟏 − L

𝑨 − 𝒙𝒒
𝒃@

TBIij	 =	(Xij	–	Min)	/	((Xij

270
Explanation:
𝒎𝒒𝑨  = Total import share of country A for
commodity q divided by the total
import of all commodities of country A
𝒙𝒒𝒃   = Total export share of country B for
commodity q divided by the total
export of all commodities of country B

This index has values ranging from 0
to 100. A value of 0 indicates that a country
does not export any goods or that another
country does not import anything.
Conversely, a value of 100 indicates that the
export and import market shares are equal or
proportional, signify ing perfect
complementarity (Alhayat, 2011).

Revealed Symmetric Comparative
Advantage (RSCA)
This study utilizes the Revealed Symmetric
Comparative Advantage (RSCA) trade index
developed by Laursen (2015) to determine
the potential or competitiveness of products.
RSCA is a modified version of the Revealed
Comparative Advantage (RCA) index
introduced by Balassa (1965), which is used
to analyze the comparative advantage of a
commodity in a country. In this study, a
modified version of the research by
(Adzimatinur, 2018) will be used. The
formulation is as follows:
𝑹𝑪𝑨 = 𝑿𝒑𝒋/𝑿𝒋
𝑾𝒑𝒋/𝑾𝒋

𝑹𝑺𝑪𝑨 = (𝑹𝑪𝑨 − 𝟏)
(𝑹𝑪𝑨 + 𝟏)
Explanation:
Xpj  = The export value of commodity p
from Indonesia to South Korea
Xj  = Total export value from Indonesia
to South Korea
Wpq   = The export value of commodity p
from the world to South Korea
Wj     = Total export value from the world to
South Korea
RSCAij index varies from -1 to +1 (or
- 1≤RSCAij≤1). The interpretation of RSCA is
similar to that of RCA. RSCAij greater than 0
implies that country i has a comparative
advantage in good j. In contrast, RSCAij less
than 0 implies that country i has a
comparative disadvantage in product j
(Saleh, 2010).
Product Mapping
Widodo (2009) developed a tool called
"Product mapping" to examine the dynamic
changes in the comparative advantage of
East Asian countries from the perspective of
industrial competitiveness in the region.
According to Widodo (2009), two indicators
are needed to represent these perspectives:
domestic trade balance and international

competitiveness. Widodo (2009) designed a
product mapping scheme that categorizes
each exported product into four groups:
Groups A, B, C, and D. Group A consists of
products with comparative advantage and
specialization in exports. Group B consists of
products with comparative advantage but no
specialization in exports. Group C consists of
products with specialization in exports but no
comparative advantage, and Group D
consists of products with neither comparative
advantage nor specialization in exports. This
can be seen in Figure 5, which is a matrix for
the distribution of all product mapping sets
exported.

Statistical Analysis
According to Pangestu Subagyo  (2003:1),
descriptive statistics refers to a branch of
statistics that deals with the processes of data
collection, data presentation, statistical
calculations, and the creation of diagrams or
graphs. According to Suryoatmono (2004:18),
descriptive statistics is a statistical method that
utilizes data from a dataset to describe or infer the
characteristics of that dataset. In this study,
various descriptive statistical tests will be utilized,
including mean, median, mode, and standard
deviation, as well as skewness tests, to illustrate
the trading patterns trend over the years. This
descriptive statistical analysis will facilitate the
summarization of trading data, identification of
average trade values, median values, mode
(most frequently occurring value), as well as the
level of data dispersion or variation (standard
deviation).

RESULT AND DISCUSSION
The economic overview of a country is
generally measured using the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) indicator. (Wibowo,
2003). Gross Domestic Product represents
the total value of all goods and services
produced within a country's borders in a
specific period, usually within one year. GDP
includes consumption, investment,
government spending, and net exports. It is
an important indicator for measuring the size
and growth of a country's economy and is
used as a basis for comparing economies
between countries.

The IMF measures the economies of
countries based on projected Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) values. In 2022,
Indonesia's GDP reached US$1.3 trillion.
This figure places Indonesia at 17th in the
world. Meanwhile, South Korea's GDP
reached US$1.6 trillion, positioning
Indonesia at 13th in the world. Despite
Indonesia having a larger p opulation and
abundant natural resources, the difference in
economic rankings indicates that South
Korea has a comparative advantage in terms
of innovation, technology, and economic
diversification, which may play a role in its
economic growth.

The significant difference in
economic growth between Indonesia and
South Korea becomes more pronounced
when looking at the average economic
growth data for the period 2013 -2022.
Indonesia achieved an economic growth rate
of 4.3 percent per year. On the other hand,
South Korea recorded an economic growth
rate of 2.7 percent per year during the same
period. This di Additionally, both nations
were significantly impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic, which resulted in widespread
disruptions to global economies. In  2020,
both countries experienced negative GDP
growth as a consequence of the severe
economic repercussions of the
pandemic.fference reflects differing
economic development strategies between
the two countries.

difference reflects the extent to which both
countries rely on international trade as the
primary driver of economic growth.

Intra-Industry Trade (IIT)
In addition to fluctuating economic growth,
the changing dynamics of trade relations,
particularly in terms of intra -industry trade
(IIT), are noteworthy. IIT refers to the
exchange of similar goods between
countries and is influenced by various
economic factors, including production
specialization and market integration.

Figure 8. Results of Grubel Liyod Index (2013-
2022)

The degree of Intra -Industry Trade
(IIT) integration per period of 2013 -2022
experienced significant fluctuations in each
commodity. The recorded Grubel -Lloyd
index values during this period show
consistent variations, depicting unstable
intra-industry trade dynamics between
Indonesia and South Korea.

The Intra -Industry Trade (IIT) index
values for each commodity group averaged
over the years 2013 -2022 indicate that
Indonesia has a high level of industrial
linkage with South Korea in the commodity
group (SITC 8) of other manufactured
articles. Furthermore, out of 10 commodities,
7 have IIT values exceeding 50 percent,
indicating a fairly strong integration, while 3
commodities have IIT values below 50
percent, with 1 commodity classified as
having weak integration and 2 commodities
classified as having m oderate
integration.The figure 9 below illustrates the

comprehensive overview of the data.


Figure 9. The statistical test results for IIT (Intra-
Industry Trade) include measures such as
mean, median, standard deviation, and
skewness.


The relatively stable average IIT
ranging from 0.43 to 0.57 reflects a
consistent level of trade integration within the
same commodity sector. However, the
annual fluctuations observed in 2016 and
2017 indicate significant trade dynamics.
The relatively low standard deviation (0.19 to
0.31) indicates that most IIT values are
clustered around the mean, showing
consistency in the level of trade
integration.The negative skewness ( -2.01 to
-0.29) suggests that the data distribution is
skewed to the right, with most IIT values
concentrated at the upper end of the
distribution. In this context, the negative
skewness indicates that extreme positive
values in the distribution (very high IIT
values) occur less frequently than extreme
negative values (very low IIT values). This
may suggest that despite annual
fluctuations, there is a tendency to achieve
high levels of trade integration most of the
time, with few cases of very low trade
integration.
Trade Balance Index (TBI)
To further understand the dynamics of trade
between Indonesia and South Korea, the
Trade Balance Index (TBI) offers insight into
the trade performance of specific
commodities. The TBI helps assess the
balance of trade in individual products,
indicating whe ther a country has a trade
surplus or deficit in a particular commodity.


Figure 10.  Results of Trade Balance Index
(2013-2022)

The significant difference between
the highest and lowest TBI values reflects the
diverse trading dynamics at the commodity -
specific level. The highest TBI value, which
is for animal and vegetable oils, fats, and
waxes (SITC 4), with an average value of
0.98 or equivalent to 1, indicates the high

potential of this commodity to generate a
surplus in Indonesia's trade balance. On the
other hand, commodities with the lowest TBI
values include beverages and tobacco (SITC
1); chemicals, and related products, n.e.s.
(SITC 5); manufactured goods primarily
classified by material (SITC 6); machinery
and transport equipment (SITC 7); and
commodities and transactions not classified
elsewhere in the SITC (SITC 9). The
negative TBI values for these commodities
indicate that Indonesia experiences a deficit
in tra de for these sectors, suggesting
dependence on imports or challenges in
export competitiveness.

Figure 11. Average Trade Balance Index (TBI)
per commodity during the period 2013-2022

From the average value per
commodity during the period 2013-2022, it is
concluded that five commodities generated a
surplus on average, while five other
commodities created a trade deficit for
Indonesia. The figure 12 below illustrates the
Trade Balance index (TBI) between South
Korea and Indonesia from 2013 to 2022. The
statistical analysis, using measures such as
mean, median, standard deviation, and
skewness, provides a comprehensive
overview of the data.

Figure 12. The statistical test results for TBI
(Trade Balance Index) include measures such
as mean, median, standard deviation, and
skewness

The fluctuating average TBI around
zero indicates a balance in exports and
imports between the two countries; however,
the slightly negative average suggests a
tendency towards Indonesia's trade deficit.
The observed annual fluctuations in the TBI
median r eflect significant volatility in the
trade balance, with negative median values
indicating Indonesia's trade deficit
dominance. The high standard deviation in
the range of 0.50 to 0.64 indicates
substantial fluctuations in bilateral trade
balance, which could be influenced by
external factors such as changes in
commodity prices or global demand.

indicating a tendency towards symmetric
data distribution, the annual fluctuations in
skewness indicate variations in the direction
and magnitude of trade imbalance. A change
in trend is evident in the decreasing
skewness values towards 2022, suggesting
a shift in the pattern of trade integration
between the two countries.

Trade Complementory Index (TCI)
In analyzing the trade relations between
Indonesia and South Korea, the Trade
Complementarity Index (TCI) serves as a
valuable indicator for measuring the degree
of complementarity between the two
economie. This index helps assess how well
the trade structures of Indonesia and South
Korea align, providing insights into their
mutual trade potential and the possibility for
further economic cooperation.

Figure 13. Results of Trade Complementory
Index (2013-2022)

According to Alhayat (2012), a TCI
value above 40 reflects a high level of trade
complementarity between the two involved
countries. The Trade Complementarity Index
(TCI) tends to remain stable above 80 for all
commodities. This indicates that the trade
structure between the related countries
maintains a high level of complementarity.
The high complementarity in trade structure,
as reflected in the stable TCI values above
80, suggests that the related countries tend
to engage in mutually complementary trade.
This means that the traded goods or services
have similar characteristics, resulting in a low
level of substitution between these items.
Figure 14. The result of the Trade
Complementarity Index (TCI) indicates the
average TCI value per commodity during the
period 2013-2022.

The highest average TCI values,
especially in the category of commodities
with code (SITC 1) for beverages and
tobacco, reflect positive prospects. This
indicates good and potential opportunities for
Indonesia to increase its exports to South
Korea. The di fference in values is not too
significant, indicating that the products
exported by Indonesia are in line with South

Korea's import needs.  However, almost all
commodities experience a decline in
complementarity indices, indicating that
Indonesia has not fully optimized its
resources and competitiveness to enter the
South Korean market. The figure 15 below
illustrates the Trade Complementarity Index
(TCI) between South Korea and Indonesia
from 2013 to 2022. The statistical analysis,
using measures such as mean, median,
standard deviation, and skewness, provides
a comprehensive overview of the data.

Figure 15. The statistical test results for TCI
(Trade Complementory Index) include measures
such as mean, median, standard deviation, and
skewness.

The high average TCI, ranging from
97.00 to 98.01, reflects a strong level of trade
structure compatibility between the two
countries. Despite annual fluctuations, the
relatively stable median TCI, ranging from
97.73 to 99.08, indicates consistency in the
level of compatibility. However, the high
standard deviation between 2.23 to 3.57
indicates significant fluctuations in TCI
values, which could be caused by changes in
trading patterns or economic policies
affecting bilateral trade structure. The
negative skewness, ranging from -1.43 to -
2.13, indicates that most TCI values are
higher than the average, indicating a high
level of compatibility in bilateral trade
structure. Overall, the TCI data provides an
overview of consistent and compatible trade
relations between Indonesia and South
Korea, with fluctuations that may be subject
to further analysis to understand the
dynamics and potential changes in the trade
cooperation between the two countries.

Revealed Symmetric Comparative
Advantage (RSCA)
The RSCA (Revealed Symmetric
Comparative Advantage) index values for
various commodity classifications offer an
overview of the extent to which Indonesia
has a comparative advantage in the
production and export of specific goods in its
trade with South Korea.  Positive RSCA
values indicate that Indonesia has a
comparative advantage  in producing and
exporting certain commodities , while
negative values suggest that South Korea
holds the  comparative advantage in those
same goods.

Figure 16. Results of Revealead Symmetric
Comparative Advantage Index (2013-2022)

The commodity with the highest
RSCA index is animal and vegetable oils,
fats, and waxes (SITC 4), with a relatively
high and stable value throughout the period.
On the other hand, the commodity with the
lowest RSCA index is m commodities and
transactions not classified elsewhere in the
SITC (SITC 9).

Figure 17. The result of Revealead Symmetric
Comparative Advantage the indicates the
average RSCA value per commodity during the
period 2013-2022

The average value of RSCA for the
period 2013-2019 shows that several
commodities exhibit fluctuating comparative
advantage characteristics between
Indonesia and South Korea. Six out of ten
commodities have average values less than
zero, such as commodities SITC (0, 1, 5, 7,
8, and 9), indicating that Indonesia does not
possess a comparative advantage in most
commodities classified based on SITC (0-9).
The commodity of animal and vegetable oils,
fats, and waxes (SITC 4) stands out with an
average RSCA value of 0.81, indicating that
Indonesia has a strong comparative
advantage in this commodity. This is followed
by commodities 2, 3, and 6, which have
average RSCA values above zero, indicating
that Indonesia also has a comparative
advantage in these commodities.
The figure 18 below illustrates the

The average RSCA close to zero,
ranging between -0.04 to -0.25, indicates
instability in relative trade advantage.
Although the observed annual fluctuations
reflect variations in trade profitability, the
relatively stable median value (between -
0.23 to 0.18) suggests that most RSCA
values are concentrated around the middle
value. The consistent level of standard
deviation, ranging from 0.47 to 0.57,
indicates a moderate level of variation in
RSCA values, which may be influenced by
changes in economic condit ions or other
factors affecting relative trade advantage.
The skewness approaching zero (between -
0.17 to 0.27) indicates a distribution of data
that tends to be symmetrical, with slight
leftward skewness.

Product Mapping
The product mapping for Indonesia and
South Korea, as shown in the figure 19 and
20 below, provides a clear view of their
export structures across the four groups,
highlighting the strengths and weaknesses in
their trade dynamics over the period 2013 to
2022. This mapping reflects the changes in
comparative advantage and export
specialization between the two countries,
offering insights into their shifting trade
patterns during the specified years.

Figure 19. Results of Product Mapping in 2013


Figure 20. Results of Product Mapping in 2022

Based on the analysis of data from 2013
and 2022, there were no significant changes
observed in the trade performance between
Indonesia and South Korea. Group A did not
experience any changes and continued to record
a trade surplus while maintaining significant
comparative advantage. Additionally, f ew
commodities showed significant changes, except
for commodities (SITC 1) and (SITC 6) which
experienced changes. Manufactured goods
primarily classified based on materials (SITC 6)
increased, moving from Group D to Group B.
Furthermore, Beverages and tob acco (SITC 1)
experienced a decline from Group C to Group D.

the trade structure between the two countries
during that period. Some commodity sectors
saw an improvement in trade performance,
while others continued to face deficit
challenges. The increased comparative
advantage in certain sectors may indicate
opportunities for enhancing bilateral trade
cooperation in the future. The higher the
comparative advantage of a product, the
higher the likelihood that a country becomes
a net exporter. These findings strongly
support Ricardo's theory of comparative
advantage in (Widodo 2009): "a nation, like
an individual, benefits from trade by
exporting goods or services in which it has
the greatest comparative advantage in
productivity and importing goods or services
in which it has the smallest comparative
advantage.”

CONCLUSION
In this study, the analysis of trade dynamics
between Indonesia and South Korea during
the period of 2013 -2022 reveals several
significant findings.
1. There is a strong integration of industries,
particularly evident in the high level of
Intra-Industry Trade (IIT) index, with 7
out of 10 commodity groups having an
IIT value above 50 percent, indicating a
robust bilateral trade framework in
specific industrial sectors. Secondly,
2. The Trade Complementarity Index (TCI)
consistently above 80 for all
commodities indicates a high level of
trade structure suitability, facilitating
consistent and complementary trade
relations. Thirdly,
3. While the overall Trade Balance Index
(TBI) indicates a near -zero trade
balance, there are significant differences
among specific commodities, with 5
creating trade surpluses and 5
generating deficits, highlighting the
contributions of specific sectors to the
overall trade balance.
4. Fourthly, fluctuations in Revealed
Symmetric Comparative Advantage
Index (RSCA) reveal varying
comparative advantages between
Indonesia and South Korea, with
Indonesia showing limited comparative
advantage in most analyzed
commodities. Fifthly,
5. Product mapping classification results
demonstrate minimal changes over time,
indicating stability in the trade structure,
with only 2 commodities experiencing
notable shifts.
6. Statistical analysis of IIT, TBI, TCI, and
RSCA reflects bilateral trade dynamics,
with stable average IIT but significant
annual fluctuations, near -zero average

TBI but notable volatility, and high
average TCI suggesting strong trade
structure suitability but requiring
attention due to annual fluctuations and
high standard deviations. The near-zero
average RSCA indicates instability in
relative trade advantages, w ith annual
variations reflecting the dynamics of
trade gains.
Based on a comprehensive
understanding of the analysis results, it is
recommended to take strategic steps to
enhance competitiveness and trade
sustainability between Indonesia and South
Korea. Policy recommendations to
strengthen trade relations between
