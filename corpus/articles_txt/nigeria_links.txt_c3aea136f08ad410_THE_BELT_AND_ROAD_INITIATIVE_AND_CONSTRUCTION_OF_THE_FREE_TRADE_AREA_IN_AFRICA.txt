The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), one of the flagship projects under the Agenda 2063 of African Union (AU), aims to eliminate intra-African trade barriers and boost African trade through trade agreements, achieve regional economic convergence and accelerate Africa’s economic integration. The establishment of the AfCFTA marks a new stage in Africa’s economic integration and is expected to have a significant impact on the growth and development of member states of the AU and is expected to expand investment opportunities and create jobs.
The year 2023 marks the 10th anniversary of Chinese President Xi Jinping announcing the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the principle of “sincerity, real results, amity, and good faith” towards African countries. Over the past decade, China and Africa have not only deepened their cooperation in trade and economy, infrastructure construction, health and cultural exchanges, but also expanded new opportunities for cooperation in areas such as environmental protection, science and technology, digital economy and climate change. Under the impetus of the BRI, China-Africa trade has continued to grow, and investment and cooperation projects have spread across the African continent. The principle of “sincerity, real results, amity, and good faith” has further consolidated China-Africa friendly relations and made the two sides work more closely in global and regional affairs. With the official launch and in-depth promotion of the AfCFTA, the BRI is increasingly in line with the development strategy of the AfCFTA, which will lay a solid foundation for the construction of a closer China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era.
