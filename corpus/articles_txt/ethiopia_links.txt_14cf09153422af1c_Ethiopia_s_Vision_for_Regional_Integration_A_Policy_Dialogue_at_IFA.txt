On December 17, 2024, the Institute of Foreign Affairs (IFA) hosted a crucial policy dialogue titled “#Ethiopia’s #Regional Integration Efforts and #BRI’s Evolving Dynamics.”
The event featured a keynote address by Mr. Adam Tesfaye, chief of staff from #@MoFA who emphasized the importance of a united Africa where goods, services, ideas, and people flow freely across borders.
The dialogue also examined the #Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), initiated by #China in 2013, which seeks to enhance global trade through infrastructure development. #Ethiopia’s involvement presents both opportunities and challenges that necessitate careful #strategic #alignment.
The event concluded with a panel discussion featuring distinguished scholars. Dr. Abdi Zenebe, Deputy Executive Director of #IFA, emphasized the need for enhanced #interagency coordination, #green development initiatives, and #strategic partnerships.
Key presentations included insights from H.E Ambassador Teshome Toga & Amba, Negus Kebede from #MoFA, who discussed Ethiopia’s regional integration efforts and the transition to a #green economy. Scholars assessed the alignment of Ethiopia’s policies with #BRI programs, focusing on modernization in the #Horn of Africa.
