MODULE 1: INTRODUCTION
Timely and sufficient supply of planting material is one of the major bottlenecks for successful
watershed rehabilitation as biological measures ensure the sustainable stabilization of physical
conservation m easures. The problem is specifically acute for grasses, which are required in large
quantities and planted on all land -use types. At present, this limitation is resulting in delays of the
completion of watershed development activities in the majority of SL M watersheds under
rehabilitation.
In order to properly address the demand for planting material, th e establishment of nurseries is
mandatory. Nurseries are a key success factor for watershed development. A nursery site is a properly
managed site, designed to produce tree or grass splits g rown under favourable conditions until they
are ready for transplanting. Nu rseries vary in si ze, facilities (supplies, tools, equipment, etc.), types
and amount of seedlings they p roduce and longevity. For instance, individual or family-run nurseries
typically p roduced f rom 50 to se veral thousand seedlings /season. La rge woreda or g overnment
nurseries produce 1,000,000 seedlings/season or more.
As a rule of thumb for a micro -watershed having an area of 500 hectares, 0. 7 million tree seedlings,
one million grass splits/cuttings and 70 kg of leguminous shrubs are needed. So for an average critical
watershed with 10-15 micro-watersheds very high amounts of planting material are needed, and the
production of this material has t o be planned very properly at woreda, CWS and MWS level. This
should be done between six months to one year ahead of the time at which the planting material
isrequired.
In addition to their function of multiplying planting materials, nu rseries can also p rovide in come
generating opportunities for the ope rators and enhance the social capi tal, technical capacity and
leadership skills of communities. Nurseries serve as impor tant training ground for many smallholder
farmers. Exposure of farmers to central woreda nurseries helps smallholder farmers to de velop
capabilities and the co nfidence to improve and conserve their landholdings th rough small-scale tree
nursing.
This technical manual was prepared to p rovide guidance for regional experts, woreda experts and
development agents so that they properly plan and implement the multiplication of adequate quantity
and quality of planting materials.
1.1 Type of nurseries
Nurseries vary in their capacity of producing seedlings. It varies f rom a few d ozens of seedlings
grown by individual farmers to p roducing millions of seedlings per year by central Woreda nurseries.
Nurseries can be classified based on life span and ownership. Based on life span, nurseries can be
either permanent or temporary. Based on ownership nurseries can be private (individual), self-help
group or community, Institute and central (Woreda). In Ethiopia and in the context of SLMP planning
framework, nurseries are classified based on ownership.
1. 1.1 Central (Woreda) nursery
Central or Woreda nurseries are e stablished and ope rated by Woreda office of agriculture and are
established to provide quality seedlings and grass splits to communities and farmers. They are designed
to operate for a longer period of time .The production capacity of those nurseries i s dictated by
government targets and usually can reach millions of seedlings/splits.They may also serve as sources of
seeds and seedlings for smallholder nu rsery operators (individual and group nurseries). Government
(central) nurseries have access to tec hnical information and resources produced by research
institutions and different donors. Hence, they have better capacity to offer technical training for the
target community and catalyse group, Institute and individual nursery development. They are
excellent in strengthening the technical and leadership skills required by communities.

8
The seedling production process in central nurseries is not mar ket-driven and is rarely commercially -
oriented, though sometimes a nominal fee is charged to ensure seedlings are valued by the community.
Central nurseries operations depend on government budget allocations. Donor funded projects (e.g.,
SLMP) usually supports government nurseries by allocation of budget for purchasing of seeds,
equipment’s and other facilities.
Project supported government nurseries can be established below woreda level. The intended
lifespan of those nurseries is usually 5 -7 years, but may continue for longer periods depending on
lifespan of projects . Production capacity varies from 100,000 se edlings up to a million per year.The
objective of establishing nurseries below woreda level is to produce  a seedlings production system
that allow the project to control the quality and number of seedlings produced and to improve access
of seedling produc ed. The obvious problem with centralised nurseries which are locate d at woreda
level is seedling distribution and limited capacity to produce adequate seedlings. In many projects, the
average distance between the central nursery and project sites is twenty or more kilometres, and
sometimes much further. Even though, the problem can be alleviated by transporting seedlings to
villages, schools and other collection points, this is only possible if vehicles are available at planting
time. Even then, there can b e problems for Lorries and pick -up trucks attempting to use bad rural
roads during the rainy season.
1.1.2 Community/ Self-help group Nursery
Community/ Self-help established & owned by community groups or highly supported by the project
as a replica of ce ntral nurseries satisfying demand of the project that could supplement capacity of
central nurseries where planting sites are very far from central nurseries. T echnical and logistic
support is provided from the project/government and should be linked with central nurseries .
Establishment of those nurseries helps to minimize problems of loss of seedling due to transportation,
human resource shortage and may provide diversified seedling species based on demand of the
community.
Group/community nurseries are also need and trust based establishments whose processing and
procedural performance would be performed with the intensive support of concerned and/or
respective professionals. It is established to impart seedling propagation and nursery management
skills to target participants, for the specific purpose of providing tree seedlings or grass splits to meet
local needs, at the same time it serves as an income generation activity. Group size is usually 10 to 25
individuals. But, it is to be determined on the ba sis of the holding capacity of the land allotted for
nursery.
Predominantly, life span of self -help group nurseries is based on: first, if revolving fund group, for a
minimum of one year and maximum of approximately five to seven year s (upon evaluated
graduation). Even after five to seven years, other jobless youth or women will again be organized
anew.
At the local level, particularly in remote areas, group and individual nurseries are often the main
source of tree seedlings and thus key supporters of re forestation, tree planting and vegetative
stabilization activities. In many cases, group nurseries sell seedlings or grasses to project supported
government agencies implementing reforestation or biological conservation activities based on
contract.
Self-help nurseries approximately produce up to 100,000 seedlings. In O romia regional state Self -
help group n urseries have the capacity to produce up 2 million seedlings. Nursery sizes may vary
depending on their location. Small self-help group n urseries may be operated by as few as 2 to 3
neighbouring households, while the bigger nurseries are operated by groups specifically organized for
such responsibilities. Both men and women have roles to play in group nurseries, from decision -
making through work plan implementation. The smaller group nurseries tend to have a longer lifespan
because collaboration is often based on relationships of family, friends and trust. Larger group

9
nurseries tend to stop operating when objectives are met or external support is termi nated. In
exceptional cases, when some members are willing to continue with their own resource it may
continue to operate.
In g roup nurseries, members are required to nominate their management c ommittee keeping their
group formulated bye -law into consideration.  The number of management c ommittee members is
five (chairperson, secretary, cashbox holder and two observers).  In Oromia, standardized cashbox is
favoured by beneficiary farmers and very luckily served as an energizer.  The work subgroup is
expected to be categorized by the management committee.  The c ommittee directs them in planning,
scheduling and programing, as well.
1.1.3 Private/Individual nurseries
Private or Individual nurseries are also known as household nurseries or backyard nurseries an d are
generally established and managed by individual farmers and/or their families. These nurseries are
usually initiated to produce seedlings or grass splits for planting on operators' personal farms. The
house compound and farmlands are used as the plan ting sites. The size, production capacity and level
of sophistication varies widely; from a few seedlings grown bare rooted, to well -fenced nurseries of a
few hundred seeds, to a thousand seedlings grown in polyethylene bags.
Although private nurseries are generally established to meet a family's need for tree seedlings or grass
splits/cuttings, they may also generate income through seedling/grass splits sales. Even more than
group nurseries, some private nurseries evolve towards market-orientation. Some individual nurseries
become exclusively commercial enterprises and provide significant income to owner -operator (e.g.
Farmers raising Apple seedling in Chencha, SNNPR:  Farmers involved on multiplication and sale of
Desho Grass and Vetiver in SNNPR and Oro mia: farmers involved in raising and sale of Gesho in
Tigray). This is particularly true in areas with a strong market demand for tree seedlings and grass
splits. Networks of individual nurseries may form to respond to these market opportunities.
Due to their limited size and facilities, individual nurseries are generally not used for formal training.
However, they can provide effective farmer to -farmer training activities. These trainings are informal
and provide farmer nursery operators and visiting farmer’s ample opportunities to exchange ideas and
experiences. Discussions are usually focused on very practical and effective topics, procedures, and
technologies. Extension agents and technicians can also learn about small -scale nursery technologies
by visiting successful individual nurseries.
Private nurseries largely depend on family resources. However, Government/projects may provide
technical and material assistance to operators, particularly during nursery establishment. This
assistance usually focuses on providing good quality seed, training on tree propagation and nursery
management and assistance on equipment’s such as water cans, hoes, spades and rakes. Commercial-
oriented individual nurseries evolve as self -funded through seedling sales and the pro vision of
technical services. In SLMP context a minimum of 8000 seedlings per year is expected from private
owners; to be considered as a private nursery.
1.1.4 Institutional nurseries
Intuitional nurseries in Ethiopia are mainly school nurseries and nur series established at Farmers
training centers (FTCs), Churches and mosques. The capacity of those nurseries can va ry between
1000-5,000 seedlings per year. Integration of the nurseries with schools and Farmers training centers
can significantly contribute to teaching of students and farmers on seedling preparation and tree -
planting techniques. Kebele level institutions (Schools and Farmers training centers) can also play a
role in multiplying and supplying seedlings to watershed development. Also churches have experience
of producing, planting and protecting forests for natural regeneration of indigenous trees.

10
1.2 Nursery linkage
During their establishment phase and the first few years of operation, most group nurseries and many
individual nurseries rec eive financial and material support. This support is primarily provided by
central nurseries and Woreda office of agriculture. The funds for support of local nursery
development are usually provided by the projects and external donors. This support can fac ilitate
networking between the different nurseries, which can have a great impact on nursery performance.

1.2.1 Selecting a nursery type
It should be noted that there is rarely a single 'best' nursery type for any given situation; any number
of types often serve the need. However, to maximize the chance of success , the criteria presented
below should be considered before selecting a nursery type.

MODULE 2: NURSERY ESTABLISHMENT
2.1 Nursery site selection
Before establishing a new nursery, we have to know whether the existing nurseries are able to satisfy
the demand for seedlings in the locality. Nursery site is selected in an area wh ere there has not been
any nursery or an area where the existing one(s) are not able to satisfy the demands. The main criteria
for selecting suitable nursery site are discussed as follows:
2.1.1 Suitable altitude
Altitude (due to its associated rainfall a nd temperature changes) has the greatest effect on the growth
of trees shrubs and grasses . Similarly, altitude affects the growth of seedlings and grasses in the
nursery. The lower the altitude and the warmer the nursery site, the quicker the seedlings grow and the
sooner they are ready for planting.
It is not advisable to grow seedlings that will be used in a highland plantation at a low land nursery
site. Seedlings should adapt to the prevailing climate in the future plantation site and this happens best
if the nursery is at approximately the same altitude as the plantation site. A good compromise is to
establish the nursery in the nearest corner of the project site.
2.1.2Availability of land
It is important that at the site chosen for the nursery , there should be enough land to raise the number
of seedlings and grass splits and if possible room for expansion. The site should be big enough to
include 20 per c ent (20%) extra for losses and damage in addition to paths between the beds, soil
storage, thatched shelter and compost- making area. The size of the nursery depends on the number of
plants to be produced, the time they will remain in the nursery, as well as the quality and slope of the
site.
It is important to ascertain who owns the land and formalize the use of the land by obtaining a letter
from the owner, government or private, agreeing to its use as a tree nursery for a defined period of
time.
Finally, it is important that the nursery will not cause problems for others, for example from the
shadow a tree will cast or by decreasing crop yields through competition for water. It may be
necessary to consult communities in order to avoid conflicts.
2.1.3 Water supply
A reliable and adequate water supply is a requisite in nursery establishment. The n ursery site should
be located near a source of water either from a running stream or main pipe water supply to sustain
rapid and healthy growth of the seedlings. The ideal situation is where there is a perennial stream at a
higher level than the nursery, a nd fairly close to it, so that water can be diverted from the stream to
the. Alternatively, a water storage tank should be installed for sustainable water supply. On average
10 to 20 litre per square metre of seedling bed is needed per day.
2.1.4 Topography
Relatively flat land, ideally with a 2 -5% slope, is most suitable for a nursery site. This permits water
to run off so that water logging does not create a problem. Completely flat land should be avoided to
prevent from water logging during heavy rains. Otherwise good drainage system should be
constructed. Avoid very steep slopes, to prevent erosion. If flat land is not available, terraces must be
constructed. Average slopes should be terraced wide enough to accommodate a normal nursery bed of
a meter in width, plus paths on each side to allow access to the beds.

13
2.1.5 Accessibility to the plantation site
The seedling transport is usually done during the rainy season. So the nursery site should have an
access road and whenever the nursery is nearer to the plantation site the transport cost can be
minimized.
2.1.6. Infrastructure
A nursery should have an all -weather road that provides access right to the site. If possible, there
should be truck access into the nursery itself so that materials can be e fficiently delivered and
seedlings easily loaded onto trucks with minimal labour inputs. It is most desirable to have a good
road system that leads from the nursery to the plantation sites so that at planting time it is possible to
quickly and efficiently transport seedlings from the nursery.
2.1.7 Availability of suitable soil
In nursery where plants are to be raised in poly bags, large quantity of sandy loam or loam soil with
well drain property, preferably forest top soil will be required. But if we have only heavy soils like
clay, then sand mixture is also required.
For bare root nursery, a deep, good-structured, easily pulverized soil is desirable. Avoid shallow soils
with a hard sandstone band near the surface. A very sandy -structured soil should also be avoided
because of poor moisture retention characteristics and faster leaching of plant nutrients. Soil
containing too much clay has poor drainage characteristics and should not be considered in site
selection.
2.1.8 Sheltered location
A nursery site should not be exposed to desiccating winds. Such winds often blow along the bottoms
of narrow, deep valleys. Desiccating dry season winds that blow steadily from the east can easily
affect the unsheltered seedlings at the pricking out stage. In such places , there is also a danger of
flooding. On the other hand seedlings can be protected from strong winds by adjacent mountain
slopes and/or by natural vegetation or by the planting of shelterbelts and wind breaks. Since the most
desiccating highland wind blows from the east, sheltered nursery sites are often found on the western
sides of the mountains.
2.1.9 Availability of labour
A lot of labour is required for the construction of the nursery and later on periodically for tasks such
as soil transportation and pot filling. Most nurseries in Ethiopia use very labour -intensive production
methods with little reliance on chemicals or mechanical equipment. It is therefore essential that a
nursery be sited only where sufficient labour can be recruited. There is signi ficant seasonal variation
in labour requirements at a nursery, and there may be a conflict with peak seasons for farm work.
2.2 Layout and design of nurseries
After a suitable site for a nursery establishment is selected, planning the layout of the nursery is the
follow up tasks which assure the management and optimal use of the area.
There is no standard layout for the nursery since differences between sites (land availability,
sloppiness, access to water etc.) must be taken into account. An ideal form f or a nursery is from
square (by which the expensive boundary fencing is kept at a minimum) to slightly rectangular shape
(by which longer working lines are provided). Only seldom an ideal, level site can be found to meet
these conditions: enough space for ideal nursery form, good road connections from any direction,
water available in any corner. In practice the form of the nursery must be tailored into road access,
into water points, and into sloppiness of the site. Some general considerations to have in mind when
planning the overall nursery design and layout are discussed below.

14
2.2.1 Nursery production units
For management purposes, a large nursery must be divided in to suitable production units. The basic
units are bed, compartment and block. Producti on should be arranged in such a way that one bed is
sown at a certain time, one compartment is sown with a certain provenance and one block is sown
with certain species. While laying out the land, care should be taken not to bury the top soil (which is
important for seedling growth) and bring up the subsoil. This is especially important while raising
bare rooted seedlings. The major production units in the nursery are nursery beds, compartments and
blocks. Whenever designing blocks and beds, consider geomet ric shapes because it helps fast and
easy management (follow up and seedling inventory) and avoids unnecessary space wastage.
Nursery bed/ Seed beds
The basic management unit in the nursery is the seedling bed. The bed is the smallest working unit
and is s elected to hold a convenient number of seedlings. It is a place where seeds are sown or in
which the transplants of cuttings are raised. It is usually about 1.0 m wide because of the difficulty of
reaching into the centre. When beds are narrower than 1m, p aths between them take up too much
space. Beds having 1m wide is acceptable with two practical advantages. First, the calculation of bed
area and inventory of seedlings is simple. Second, the manual work over the bed -seed sowing,
transplanting, weeding and watering are easy. For this reason, the bed width should not exceed 1.0 m.
The standard length of a nursery bed is 10m. It is a compromise between two factors. The longer the
bed, the more optimal the use of nursery space will be. On the other hand, the longer the bed the more
cumbersome the watering becomes.
One square meter of seedling bed can accommodate 156 pots of a diameter of 8cm. Thus, a bed of
1x10 m can accommodate a maximum of 1560 seedlings.
The working path between the seedling beds varie s from a minimum of 0.50m to about 1.0. In flat or
gently sloping areas, a bed width of 0.5m can be used, but if the soil must be terraced for the seedling
beds, more space between the beds must be reserved, up to 1m or even more.
The seedling bed is prep ared by first digging a shallow excavation. The depth of the bed is one -third
the height of the pots. So, if the height of the pots is 15cm, the depth of the excavation is 5cm. A layer
of coarse sand or gravel can be spread on the bottom of the bed to provide good drainage. In this case,
the excavation should be dug slightly deeper. The earth that has been dug out of the bed may be left as
a small ridge along the outer row of the pots to protect them from excessive heat.
All beds should be raised above the ground to prevent damage from flooding and sedimentation. If
possible, the beds should run from north to south so that either side will receive equal exposure to
sunlight.
The beds can be framed by wood, brick, stone, bamboo or plain wire. Wood is usually the best, but it
is often too expensive. The frames should be constructed about 15 to 20cm high. Nursery bed could
be: raised, sunken or level.
Raised nursery beds: are made in high rain fall areas. Raised beds are made 10 -15cm above ground
level with su pport of bricks, stones or bamboo or bellies which prevent edges of the beds from
crumbling during rains or while giving irrigation to the beds. These beds tend to prevent water
logging. Even during heavy rains, the root zone is not flooded due to raised beds. Drainage in growing
areas is also easy. Raised beds are good for those seeds which do not require more moisture for
germination. Such beds are good for raising seedlings of teak.
Sunken seed beds: are made in dry areas. The objective of making sunken beds in dry areas is to
avoid flow of water outside the bed. Sunken beds are made by excavating the soil in the bed area.
These beds are usually 10cm to 30cm dipper than the normal ground level. It is better to connect such
sunken beds to a common drainag e line so that water does not stand during rains. Sunken beds are
made for raising the seedlings in the bed or for keeping the polythene bags in the bed. Generally, if the
seeds are to be sown in the bed, the depth is 10-15cm. However, if the polythene bags are to be kept in

15
the bed the depth is kept about 20 to 30cm depending upon the length of the polythene bags used.
Generally, the depth of bed should be 5cm less than the length of the polythene bag. When polythene
pots are used for raising the plants, it is advisable to put a polythene sheet equal to length, breadth and
height of the bed. This prevents water to go down in the soil. It also prevents the roots of the plant
from penetrating the ground.
Level seed beds : - are made in normal rainfall areas. These beds are easily irrigated by cans. The
surface of the nursery bed should be perfectly flat or should have a slight camber. In order to enable
good drainage in the beds, surface dressing is very important. If the soil is heavy, such dressings are
more necessary.
Compartments
The second management unit in the nursery is the compartment. A suitable number of seedling beds
are grouped into one compartment. Compartments are located at approximately 1m from surrounding
unproductive land such as roads, hedges and windbreaks as well as from neighbouring compartments.
A suitable number of seedling beds in one compartment are 20; the productive area is then 200m2 and
the maximum number of 8-cm pots is 31,200. However, the number of seedling beds in one
compartment can vary according to the degree of the slope.
Blocks
The third management unit is the block. Several compartments (for instance, 4 to 6) are grouped
together, framed by hedges and separated from each other with nursery roads or irrigation
canals.Whenever designing blocks and beds, consider ge ometric shapes because it helps for f ast and
easy management (follow up and seedling inventory) and avoids unnecessary space wastage. Beds can
be divided into two; beds for potted seedlings; and beds for bare rooted seedlings.
2.2.2 Infrastructure
The lists of infrastructure important for nursery development are as shown below:
Buildings
It is essential to have an office where records of seeds, sowing, etc., can be conveniently and
accurately maintained and filed. If there is no office with a table and chair it will be difficult to record
the basic information which is essential for future planning as well as documentation of past seedling
production. The nursery office also serves as protection from wind and ra in, t emporary store and
meeting and training place for nursery workers.
Roads
There are two types of roads in a nursery. A primary, all -weather road that is wide and suitable
enough for trucks and tractors that shuttle to the nursery. This road also shoul d traverse the entire
nursery at least once to allow for efficient transport of seedlings. If the space and terrain allow,
another all-weather road should be constructed as a perimeter and a third cross -road against the main
traverse. The width requirement for the primary nursery roads is 5m.Secondary access roads, 3m
wide, are needed to provide access to all blocks (and to separate them), buildings, the soil dump and
germination compartments. These secondary roads do not need to be all-weather roads.
Windbreaks
Tender seedlings must be sheltered efficiently against the dry season winds. During the first years of
nursery operation, temporary windbreaks around the compartments may be sufficient; however, the
best windbreak in the long run is a living one. Hedges between blocks serve partly as windbreaks. The
best windbreak is the one that does not stop the wind entirely, but slows speed by letting part of the air
penetrate the obstacle. A solid windbreak (wall) creates air turbulence behind the wall, and the
sheltering effect does not reach far.

16
Fencing and shelterbelts
A very effective tree for making live fence is Cupressus lusitanica. A good quality tree for effective
live fence is that which can be pruned the side branch and the tip and 3 meters high an d 2 metered
wide at the bottom which by frequent pruning will be attractive and also effective against animals.
To form an effective live fence Cupressus lusitanica takes 3-4 years. To establish a live fence there
should be a well prepared 2.5-3m wide land.
Steps for live fence establishment
1. Digging 1 meter wide place in the 2.5-3m area
2. Marking two lines 50cm apart i.e. from the 1m dug place 25cm from each side
3. In the marked line planting of strong and about 30cm high seedlings at an interval of 50 cm.
The plated trees on one line should be in zigzag with the other line
4. Proper watering and weeding
5. When the seedling reaches a height of 1.5m pruning the tip and side branch so that it will be
wider at the bottom and narrow at the top so that sunlight can easily reach the bottom parts.
6. In order to ensure that the branches are interwoven and maintain proper shape frequent
pruning is necessary
The outer side of the live fence should be planted with shrubs (serving as barriers against livestock)
while the inner one with trees. Tree/shrubs recommended for the outer and inner part are as follows:
Acacia holosericea, Eucalyptus Camsldunesis, Acacia. Senegal, Euc. Globulus, Ziziphus spina –
Christi, Euc. Citriodora, Parkinsonia acculata, Casuarina cunninghamiana, Prosop is Juliflora,
Casuarina equistifolia, Leucaena leucocephala Euphorbia tirucalli, Cupressus lusitanica, Grevillea
robusta
Soil dump
For a nursery with a capacity of 100,000 seedlings, a shed with 5 m x 3 m in area and 2 m height
should be sufficient. The de livery truck should have road access to the storage dump so that double
handling and moving by wheelbarrow are not required.
Seed-extraction area
Most nurseries collect and extract at least some of their own seed requirements. An area exposed to
plenty of sunshine is needed for efficient seed extraction in some species.
Compost area
In dry climates it is usual to prepare compost in pits. A convenient size is 1 -1.5 m deep, 1 m wide and
2 m long. The compost pit should have a roof to provide shed and protection from rain.

Nursery equipment’s and tools
Even if seedling production can begin with a minimum of infrastructure and tools, and the n ursery
appears to run well producing good seedlings for the first year of planting, a further plan for
additional equipment and material must be prepared as soon as possible. The orders for materials must
be placed well in advance, and the building of infr astructure (stores, shelters, office, housing, etc)
should start at an early stage. By careful planning the nursery will run smoothly later when it is in full
production.The minimum equipment needed for a labor intensive model nursery with the production
capacity of 0.6 to 1.0 million seedlings per annum are listed on Table 5.

MODULE 3: PLANNING OF PRODUCTION
3.1 Identification of demand
Planting material demand depends on the type (pot raised or bare rooted seedlings), species and
quantity of plantlets to be planted on a specific area of land. Hence, what and how much we have to
produce in our nursery depend on the suitability of species to the area and the density we want to
achieve.
Major intervention areas calling for biological measures in watershed development are:
1. Land area to be afforested, re-afforested, or  scattered Agroforestry system;
2. Gully and/or degraded land area intended to be rehabilitated with plantation;
3. Number of water harvesting structures to be associated with plantation;
4. Length of all SWC Physical structures intended to be supplemented with biological measures;
5. Number of seedling needed for replacement planting or beating up;
6. Also eventual demand of free market could be included
The following hypothetical example of a watershed illustrates on how to quantify demand of tree
seedlings, grass splits and forage seed per year for production or procurement.
Let as assume for watershed X, the following intervention are supposed
I) Total communal land degraded in the watershed is 300 hectares. In this area, 60 km of
Hillside terrace + trench is planned for implementation. Besides in 100 ha of the area, it is
planned to plant Grevillea. There is also 50 hectares of forest area which demands
enrichment planting.
II) Total Farmland in the watershed is 100 hectares. To address the land degradation issue on the
farmland, 10 km of grass hedge, 50 km of soil bund and 20 km of stone faced soil bund is
planned. Besides scattered trees are planned on the whole area.
III) There are 50 households in the watershed, for each household the plan is to develop a
woodlot.
IV) The watershed has 2 km o f active gully. 30 brush wood check dams and 20 sand bag check
dams are planned for physical treatment. The total area requiring revegetation is 3
hectares.
Table 6 below shows the planting material demand of the hypothetical watershed presented above. As
shown on the Table 6, the total demand of the watershed is 750,000 grass splits, 72.5 kg of forage
seed, 661,669 tree seedlings and 320,000 grass cuttings.

 Forage seed ref ers to sesbania, pigeon pea or t reelucern sown along Terraces in association
with grass splits. According to the CBWDG, soil bunds are planted with grasses in
association with leguminous shrubs. According to SLM P experience, direct sowing is the
cheapest way of establishing leguminous shrubs along terraces.
 Grass splits refers to splits of Desho/Vetiver/Mulatto/Phalaris and etc. planted on terraces
 Grass cuttings refers to cuttings of elephant grass /bana grass /green gold, planted in reshaped
gully walls and gully beds
 Tree seedlings refers to seedling of trees planted on open space between terraces/ degraded
areas
3.2 Identification of appropriate species
There are two factors to be considered when choosing appropriate species for planting: 1) site
characteristics and limitations which are also referred as agro -ecological suitability and 2) use or
objective of the plantation ( fuel wood, forage, land rehabilitation, stabilizing conservation
structures, environmental protection and etc.).
Availability of tree/grass species and demand of communities is also considered. Annex Table 2
and 5 shows list of tree and grass species suitable for different agro -ecologies, land uses and
purposes.
3.3 How to plan production of tree seedlings
Before we start to produce tree seedlings on nurseries, it is important to know the total demand of the
area planned for rehabilitation. As explained on sec tion 2.1, this is obtained from the annual plan of
different intervention areas. Once this is obtained, the total quantity is fixed considering allowances
and losses. After deciding the actual quantity planed and determining the species that fits the speci fic
objective within the agro-ecology, the next important issue is to identify the type seedling we need to
raise that should be categorized as containerized and non-containerized (bare-rooted) seedling.
It is very important as some species are better su ited to growth in pots and others can be conveniently
grown without container. However, many species can also be raised by either system. Considerate
decision to choose species to the appropriate method leads to efficient planning. The decision to make
choice of the type of seedling depends on:
 Susceptibility to hardship while lifting, transporting and planting;
 Susceptibility to soil-borne diseases while in nursery;
 Labour requirement versus realizing the objective;
 Successfulness after planting (survival rate);
 Space requirement in the nursery
 Growing time in the nursery;
 Cost efficiency
3.3.1 Determination of total quantity of seedling required
Annual need for tree seedlings can be calculated based on the planned area to be planted, and the
planting spacing or density also referred as stocking rate.
The spacing (planting density) which determines the number of trees to be planted per hectare is again
determined by the type of species, site characteristics and objective of plantation. The following is
used as a guide:
 Slow growing species require closer spacing where as fast growing species need wider
spacing.

21
 For fertile and favorable site, closer spacing is used and wider spacing for moisture deficit
area.
 Closer spacing is used for products like pulp , fencing, fodder and fuel wood and wider
spacing for products like timber.
 Very closer spacing is used for species planted with objective of soil and water conservation
and fodder production in order to produce larger biomass and ensure maximum ground
vegetation cover. In addition , if the main purpose is to produce biomass in a very shorter
period of time and in large quantities, high planting densities is mandatory.
The most common spacing in plantation forestry is 2.5 x 2.5 m, or 1,600 trees per ha.  I n rotations of
about 10 years, this density ensures an acceptable mean annual increment for eucalypts.  Another
common spacing, which is most frequent in Ethiopian fuel wood plantations, is 2 x 2 m,
corresponding to 2, 500 trees per ha.  This denser spacin g enables somewhat shorter rotation, but it
has also been found to be practical in eliminating some of the need for beating up.
However, in case of soil and water conservation there is a variation from that of plantation forestry
on the purpose of plant ing. It requires different considerations like stabilizing structures, degraded
land and gully rehabilitations which generally follow different principle for spacing. In this case,
the required quantity of seedling production can be calculated on the bases of different purposes
such as:
1. Land area to be afforested, re-afforested, or  scattered Agroforestry system;
2. Gully and/or degraded land area intended to be rehabilitated with plantation (Total
number is found by dividing the area to be planted with spacing of plantings) ;
3. For water harvesting structures associated with plantation; total number of seedlings
is found by multiplying number of water harvesting structures with number of
seedlings per structure;
4. For a ll SWC Physical structures intended to be supplemented with Biological
measures; number of seedlings is found dividing the length with spacing.
3.3.2 Determination of nursery space requirement
Once, the total quantity of seedling required is determined and known, the area of the nursery can b e
calculated, based on the maximum number of seedlings to be produced. When making calculations of
area required, a 20% allowance is made for losses.
The area needed for a nursery depends not only on the number of seedlings to be raised, but also on
the proportion of seedlings that are raised as potted plants and bare-root seedlings. The diameter of the
pot and the spacing between bare-root seedlings also has an effect on the area needed.
For example, if the pot diameter is 8 cm, then 156 pots per square meter can be accommodated in pot
beds. If the pot diameter is increased to 10 cm, then only 100pots per square meter can be
accommodated. The area required per pot increases proportional to the square of the radius of each
pot. Therefore pot -bed area needed increases rapidly with increasing pot diameter. The number of
filled tubes (n) per square meter can be calculated using the following formula:
With this information the pot-bed area (A) needed can be easily calculated;
Total pot-bed area needed (A) is equal to the total seedlings needed (N) divided by the number of
tubes (n) per m2.
n = (100/d) 2(where d = diameter of pot in centimetres).

22

12 69 145
Bare-root seedling calculations can be based on the recommended spacing ranging from 5 by 5 cm to
20 by 20 cm.

Spacing Seedlings/m2 m2 needed

5 by 10 200 50
10 by 10 100 100
10 by 20 50 200
20 by 20 25 400
Besides effective bed area, additional nursery space is needed for infrastructure that includes areas for
paths between beds, roads, channels for irrigation, water tank, soil dump, stores, fences and
windbreaks. If seed is collected by the project, an additional corner is needed for threshing and
cleaning the seed.
The ratio of total area required for the nursery (including roads, windbreaks, etc.) to the area for pot
beds is likely to be approximately 3:1. This ratio can be used for planning purposes.
For example; a nursery producing the following amount of seedlings;
200.000 potted seedlings in 8 cm pots 1282 m2
200.000 potted seedlings in 10 cm pots 2000 m2
100,000 potted seedlings in 12 cm pots 1449 m2
120,000 bare rooted seedlings at spacing 5 by 5 cm 300 m2
Total production area needed 5031 m2
Based on the 3:1 ratio the total nursery area needed can be estimated as;
5031 m2 production area + working area (5031/3) = 6708 m2
3.4 How to plan production of grass splits and cuttings
Though planting leguminous shrubs is an excellent means of re -vegetation and stabilization of
conservation structures, they are less effective than grass in stabilizing against erosion. Therefore, it is
recommended that areas to be planted with leguminous shrubs be planted with grasses. Grasses are
usually mixed with 10 -50% leguminous shrubs. Leguminous shrub fixes nitrogen from the
atmosphere and thus contributes to improving soil fertility. I n addition to the above benefits, most of
the shrub species provide higher protein when used as forage.
3.4.1 Determination of total quantity required
Tables6presented below shows a guide on how to calculate demand of grass splits and elephant
grass/bana grass cuttings.

3.4.2 Determination of space requirement for multiplication
The following examples presented below will help to calculate the space requirement for vegetative
multiplication of Vetiver, Desho grass and elephant/bana grass.
For Vetiver and Desho grass in:
a) Central nursery/group nursery
 If one starts with 285 clumps of vetiver or  desho grass in a
central/group  nursery;
 285 clumps (each clump contains on the average 20-50 splits) have
nearly 10,000 splits;
 This is usually planted at a distance of 0.40 cm x 0.40 cm in a nursery.
 This requires an area of 2000 m2. ;
 After 3-6 months (depending on management). Each split planted can
produce 20-50 new slips, corresponding to a total average of 350,000
splits.
 This will be enough to stabilize 70 km of soil bund or fanya-juu in a
watershed.
b) Individual nursery
 5 clumps of either of the grasses could be enough material for starting for one family.
 175 splits (each clump containing about 35 splits) can be planted at a distance of 40 cm x 40
cm from each other in a nursery of about 28 m²
 4-8 months later, each splits planted can produce in turn 35 new splits, corresponding to a
total of 6125 new splits.
 Transplanted every 20 cm on anti-erosive soil bunds, these 6125 splits can vegetate 1.2 km of
soil bund.
For Elephant grass:
 Elephant grass is propagated by stem cuttings or splits.
 Splits generally take more labour to prepare (uproot) and to plant but result in quicker
establishment.
 Using cuttings is more economical than root splits.
 Elephant grass is mainly used for gully re -vegetation, re -vegetation of degraded lands and
bund stabilization (dwarf elephant grass).
 If our intention is to re -vegetate a gully of 1 km length (0.7 -1 ha). This requires 56,000 -
80,000 cuttings (18,666 -26,666 canes).
 To multiply this in a nursery, a minimum of 500 m2 nursery area is required.
3.5 How to plan demand of seed required for nursery & direct sowing
The amount of seed we need to purchase depends on the purity of seeds and germination percent. For
example, if we want to produce 60,000 seedlings of a given s pecies, the amount of seed we want to
avail is calculated as follows:

24
3.5.1 Purity percent
In order to calculate the purity percent of a certain seed lot, a sample of 10 gram is taken and counted.
Assume that the number of pure undamaged seeds in 10 gram s of seed is 284. This implies that there
are 28,400seeds per kilogram. Then to arrive at the purity percent weight the pure seeds. Assume that
it weighed 8.6gm. The purity % = (8.6/10) =86%.
3.5.2 Germination percent
Information on germination rates for e ach seed lot is essential to determine appropriate sowing rates
and calculate the total amount of seed required for the planned production levels.
In order to determine the germination percent, count 200 seeds from the pure seeds (record
provenance, sowing date). Then count the number of seeds germinated (every week). Remove
counted ones. When conducting germination test is not possible, Annex table 1 can be used as a
reference.
For example if  32 seeds  are germinated after one week, 104 seeds after two we eks and 122 seeds
after three weeks, the germination percent is calculated as:
Once we know the purity and the germination percent, it is possible to know how much seed we need
to produce the required seedlings. If for instance, our target is 60,000 seedlings,
The seed demand is calculated as follows:
Given germination percent is 61%,
And the weight of these seeds is:
Assuming the number of undamaged seed per kilogram is 28,400 (see 3.5.1),
Since the purity is 86%, the total amount of seed we need is:
Kg
Since all germinated seeds does not reach planting site, consider 20% loss which gives us a total of
4.83244 kg. This is the amount of seed we have to order for purchase or collection.
3.6 Estimating proportion of direct sowing
Forage seed like sesbania, pigeon pea or treelucern are sown along Terraces and gully beds and walls
in association with grass splits and cuttings and alone on degraded Hill sides and grazing areas.
According to SLM experience, direct sowing is the cheapest way of establishing leguminous shrubs
on those land uses.
The proportion of direct sowing in watershed development could vary between 20-30 % depending on
the proportion of terraces constructed on farmlands and gullies planned for rehabilitation.

MODULE 4: NURSERY SOIL PREPARATION
4.1 Obtaining potting mixes
The growing media or “soils” that are used in pots (or tubes) are possibly the most important factor in
growing high -quality, healthy seedlings. Careful selection, mixing, treatment and handling of the
components of the potting soil should provide the best possible growing conditions for plants,
resulting in healthy seedlings that have a high chance of survival in the field.
The potting mix must provide water, nutrients, oxygen and physical support f or the seedlings as long
as they are in the nursery. A single source of soil is not usually able to provide all these requirements,
so it is necessary to mix several components together to produce the potting mix. We must rely on
mixing soil, sand and manu re/compost in such proportions that the basic requirements for healthy
plant growth are fulfilled.
4.2 Soil components
The basic soil component for pots is sandy loam or loamy sand. It should be found in sufficient
quantities either in the nursery or in th e vicinity of the nursery. Availability of soil is one of the
criteria for choosing the nursery site. The soil particles in sandy loams and loamy sands are ideal to
provide good soil aeration, root penetration and easy watering.Often the ideal mineral soil is not
found. The available topsoil inside the nursery or in the vicinity, is either too heavy (clay) or too light
(sandy). Neither of these options is good, but both of them are usable if their basic properties are
understood.
Clay soils have a tendency to become hard and compact. They absorb water too slowly and the
irrigation of pots becomes difficult. However, clay soils can be improved by adding sand or some
humus rich soil. The presence of clay soil helps the soil bound the roots & form soil cylinder
(improves adhesion). Nursery residues are added to mixture, they must be chopped into small pieces.
As such they decompose quicker, and this later facilitates mixing the compost into other nursery soil.
4.3 Organic matter
It is widely accepted that organ ic matter has several important benefits for producing a high quality
potting mixture, and thus helping to produce high -quality seedlings. The main benefits of organic
matter are the following:
 It binds together the mineral particles of soils into aggregat es. This improves soil structure
and therefore the supply of oxygen and water to the plants.
 It is a source of nutrients for plants. These nutrients are released slowly as the organic matter
gradually decomposes,
 It regulates the supply of nutrients by hol ding them in readily available forms and reducing
losses into drainage water through leaching.
 It helps to control root diseases through a general reduction in the level of pathogens by
antagonistic micro-organisms that decompose the organic matter.
 It may stimulate seed germination, root development and general plant growth through the
plant-hormone-like activity of some of its components.
4.4 Soil mixtures
A common problem is that soils are too “heavy” in texture; that is, they contain too much clay and
silt. These results in poor aeration and little pore space, both of which reduce root growth. The final
mixture should have a texture classified as “sandy loam” or “loamy sand”.
The proportions of soil, sand and compost/manure to be used will depend on the individual nursery
because the texture of the soil component used in each one varies. There can be substantial changes
even at one nursery if the origin of the mix components changes from year to year.
A mix containing soil, sand and compost in the ratio of 2:1:1 is recommended as adequate for the
healthy growth of the majority of species. Some nurseries had adopted ratios such as 3:1:1 and found

26
seedling quality improved due to the improved root growth in these lighter-textured mixes. If the high
cost precludes using sand in such a high proportion, then try to include as much compost as possible,
up to a maximum of 40%.
If possible, forest topsoil, which often already contains a high proportion of sand, should be used to
produce the final potting mix. Su ch topsoil often also contains useful organic matter and has a lower
pH than dam silt, but it may also contain a lot of weed seeds.Now, the different nursery soil
components are ready: local nursery soil as a basic soil, forest soil, some compost, some cat tle
manure. All the components have also been sieved to a uniform size that is easy to mix, pour and
press into seedling pots. How should the different components be mixed?
The determining factor in mixing is the structure of the basic mineral soil. If a g ood sandy loam or
loamy sand has been found, only some compost, cattle manure or forest soil is needed to improve the
basic material. The mi xing proportion of basic soil to humus soil is 80 -20. If the basic soil is clay,
some sand must be added to make the mixture lighter.  The mixing proportion of clay to sand to
humus is 50-40-10. In some areas only sandy topsoil is available for use as the basic material. In such
cases it is better to transport humus -rich soils -if available - than poorer clay materials. P referable
mixing proportion of sand to humus soil is 67 -33 (3 to 2) . Suitable mixing proportions are found by
test and experience. All soil particles must be sieved and thoroughly mixed before pot filling.
4.5 Determining soil volume
Potting soil is bulky material. Its availability must be secured well in advance by looking for a soil
source that is sufficient and by having enough transport capacity to carry the soil to the nursery. The
transport of nursery soil is the first activity in preparations for the coming nursery and planting
season. It should begin immediately upon completion of the main rains when the roads to the soil
source are passable.
For potted seedlings the amount of soil required is:
Where
 = 3.14
V= Volume (amount) of soil required
r = radius of container
L = length of container
N = no of seedling to be produced
Example. If we are planning to produce 500,000 seedlings in pot of size (5cm diameter and 15 cm
height), how much soil do we need?
For potted seedlings the amount of soil required is

To produce seedlings on bare root (seed beds) 1m3 of is enough for 10m2 of bed size (10*1m).
4.6 Preparation of polythene pots
4.6.1 Size of container (Pot)
The size of seedling that can be grown depends primarily on the size of container available. A general
guide is that seedling height should be not more than twice the length of the tube. This is dictated by
the fact that, for good survival, seedlings must have a good root/shoo t ratio. If large seedlings are
grown in small tubes they will invariably have a low root/shoot ratio and subsequently poor survival.
To decide on container size it is therefore essential to have information on the size of seedlings that
constitutes the m ost suitable target seedling for planting. From experience in other countries it is
recommended to have a seedling at least 20 cm tall for planting in relatively dry climates. Experience
suggests that tubes at least 15 cm long would be required. A 15 -cm long tube is suitable for growing
seedlings with a height of 15 - 30 cm. If larger seedlings are to be grown, then longer tubes are

27
required. If grass competition is likely, then larger pots, in which larger seedlings can be grown,
should be used. This is par ticularly relevant to eucalypts which are not tolerant of grass competition
during the first few years after planting.
It is a general rule that the dryer the climate, the larger the container required. The reliability of
rainfall in the post -planting seedling establishment period of about a month is also very important in
determining container size. The less reliable the rainfall, the larger the container required. From
experiences in Ethiopia, containers with 8-12 cm in diameter and 15 -20 cm length for a reas with
rainfall of 400-800 mm per year are suitable.
It is clear that larger tubes result in better survival because they allow for development of larger root
systems and greater moisture storage, but of course larger tubes are more costly. Larger tub es incur
greater cost for tubing, potting mix, watering, weeding, transporting to the planting site, etc. A
balance must be achieved between greater production and planting costs and increased survival when
using larger pots. It is suggested that the other , cheaper, nursery -management improvements
suggested in this manual be implemented first. Remember that if the tube diameter is doubled while
maintaining a constant length, the volume and weight of the tube increases four-fold.
A suitable pot size also de pends on the species grown. Larger pots, and also larger seedlings, are
needed for beating-up (replanting to replace dead seedlings in plantations) to enable them to catch up
to the seedlings that were planted earlier.
A 5-cm diameter tube can be from 10 to 20 cm long. A practicable length is 15 cm, as is commonly
used in highland nurseries. Problems with air pockets can easily develop with longer tubes unless
filling with the potting mix is done very carefully, providing just sufficient compacting to prev ent air
pockets. There are also difficulties with stability of long pots when standing them in pot beds, and this
can result in non-vertical tubes with uneven root development within the pot. For 8-cm diameter tubes
a length of 20 -25 cm is appropriate. In general terms, the ratio of tube length to diameter should be
about 3:1.
Tubing for containers must be ordered in adequate time so that it is in stock at the nursery in required
quantities before pot filling begins. Using tubing of 0.05 -mm gauge, 1 kg of plastic (polyethylene)
will produce about 1,000 tubes of 8 -cm lay-flat diameter and 15 cm length. One reel of tubing should
produce 4,500 pots, so that one carton which contains two reels should produce 9,000 pots. For 1
million seedlings, 1,000 kg of pla stic rolls would be required. For pots of 8 -cm diameter and 20 -cm
length, about 500 pots can be obtained from each kilo of plastic. Therefore, for these larger pots that
are usually used in lowland nurseries, you will need 2,000 kg of plastic roll for 1 mi llion seedlings.
When ordering plastic it is usual to specify the width of the tubing when it is laid flat. Thus if you
order 8-cm diameter lay-flat tubing it will produce filled pots with a diameter of 5 cm.
Currently the tubing is cut to the required le ngth of individual pots by laboriously cutting single
lengths by placing the endless tubing on a wooden board marked at regular intervals. In this way 20
pieces can be cut at a time thus greatly improving productivity. The diameter of the round -wood
determines the length of the pots obtained. If the diameter is 4.8 cm, tube length will be 15 cm, while
a diameter of 6.4 cm will provide 20-cm long tubes. The round wood is best turned in a lathe, but it is
also possible to use a debarked piece of branch of the required diameter. The efficiency and
convenience of the pot -cutting roll can be further improved by fitting a winding handle to the round -
wood.
Pot size can be selected from diameters between 4 and 10cm. Also the length can vary. The smallest
pots are u sually 10 cm long; the widest pots can be up to 25cm long. The general rule holds: the
bigger the pot and the earth ball, the better the success in planting. However, the pot soil that can be
obtained and transported becomes unbearable if the pot size is i ncreased. If the diameter is doubled
and the length of the pot remains the same, the volume of soil needed becomes four fold (Table

28
below). Therefore, the pot size must always be a compromise between secured planting and practical
limits in soil transport.
The pot size also depends on the tree species. Broad -leafed trees or fruit trees require larger pots than
eucalyptus.

4.6.2 The need for plastic tubes
Plastic tubing is usually the most important piece of imported material in the nursery. Plastic tubes are
needed early in the nursery p roduction preparations: at the start of pot filling. The amount to be
procured should be calculated carefully. For example a polythene tube with 8cm laid flat diameter we
can get an average of 500 pots (15cm height). Therefore a nursery planning to produce 500,000
seedlings using 8cm laid flat diameter needs about 10 quintals of polythene tube.
4.7 Potting methods
The plastic pots are filled with soil mixture either by hand or by using a funnel. The pots are filled
first from the bottom to a height of about 5cm. This bottom soil is compacted. The remainder of the
pot is filled loosely. Packing pots in stages is important to avoid air pockets inside the soil. After
filling, the pots are transferred to beds where they are packed tightly in an upright position to await
seed sowing or seedling transplanting.
4.7.1 Seedbeds
The soil used for seedbeds in nurseries is often the locally occurring topsoil. It is better; however, if a
separate mix can be used for seedbeds to cater for the special demands of germinati ng seeds. Seedbed
mix should be sieved through a 2 -mm mesh sieve to ensure larger particles do not interfere with
germination. It is even more important than for potting mixes that seedbed mixes should be well
drained, as disease is especially prevalent in germinating seeds.
Light-textured mixes also allow the roots to be removed more easily without damage at pricking -out
(transplanting) time. The proportions of soil and sand to use for a good seedbed mix depend on the
specific particle-size distribution at a given nursery. A mix of one part river sand and one part sandy
loam soil should usually be suitable. There is no need to add compost to seedbeds as the seedlings will
not grow there for such a sufficiently long time as to require large amounts of nutr ients. Indeed,
compost often increases the severity of disease in non-pasteurized mixes.
4.3.2 Sieving and mixing
The potting -mix components should all be sieved before mixing together so that no large clods,
stones, roots, etc., are present in the fina l mix. A mesh size of about 1 -cm is usually adequate, but 5 -

29
mm mesh is preferred and often recommended. The sieves in most nurseries are made with the same
wire mesh used to make beds, and they have proven quite satisfactory. For seedbed soil, a 2-mm mesh
sieve is better. For covering seed and for refilling holes during pricking -out, it is best to use fine 20
sand which is below 1 mm in diameter. If such fine sand is not available, then at least the sand should
be sieved through a 2-mm mesh.
After sieving, the dry components are thoroughly mixed to provide a uniform distribution of soil, sand
and compost. The different components should be measured by volume, for which a wheelbarrow is
convenient as a unit of measurement. To facilitate easier mixing, it is good to dump single barrow
loads of the various mix components in alternating sequence into a heap. This heap is then turned over
to make another adjacent heap. This process of repeated turning is continued three or four times,
backwards and forwards, to obtain a uniform mixture.
4.7.3 Filling pots
After the preparation of a suitable potting mix, and having cut polythene tubes to the required length,
you can begin pot filling. The soil mix should be moist but not saturated to facilitate rapid filling of
pots to the required density.
If open-ended tubes must be used, it is only necessary to compact 3-5 cm of soil in the bottom of the
tube. This can be conveniently done with a flat-ended round stick of about 4-cm diameter.
Alternatively, a tube is compacted by hand pressure at the top end only after filling and the tube is
then inverted when it is placed in the pot beds.
The rest of the tube should be filled with quality soil mix to the top of the polyethylene, with only
slight compacting so that air pockets do not develop in the tube. The development of air pockets is
especially likely with longer tubes and this is the main reason why tubes with a diameter of 5 cm
should be no longer than 20 cm.
The filled tubes can conveniently be stacked and carried t o pot beds in robust planting trays. The
tubes must remain in a vertical position all the time, in contrast to the compacted soil tubes which are
stacked horizontally for convenience of nursery workers. Pots should be placed into pot beds exactly
vertically to prevent roots growing unevenly within the pot. Pots should be packed tightly, but without
deformation. This will leave spaces for drainage of any excess water between pots.

MODULE 5: SEED PREPARATION
5.1 Seed supply, processing and storage
5.1.1 Seed
Successful raising and growing of trees depends on the right kind of seed, good quality, sufficient
amount and availability at the right time. Seed can be obtained from distributors or collected locally.
5.1.2 Seed supply
In any stand of trees of the same species, whether in natural forest or plantation, the individual trees
often appear different in many respects, for example, vigour, health, stem form, branch size, fruit,
fodder or resin production.
When we wish to produce more t rees of the same species, we aim to use plants that have the best
characteristics in respect of the product we want. To achieve this, we must collect seeds from trees
which show one or more of the desired characteristics.
Selecting good trees as a source o f the seed (mother trees), however, will not in itself ensure that we
reach the goal of growing more trees with the desired characteristics. The ways in which the seed are
collected and subsequently processed, transported, stored and pre -treated also have critical
consequences for seed quality and, eventually, the final results of the tree plantings.
Seed orchards can easily be established around nurseries and Farmer Training centres. These sites
serve both the demonstration, teaching and as sources of seed s of desired species. The huge gap
between demand and supply of seeds can be easily minimized locally if such approach is followed.
Moreover, strategies like organizing landless people in seed collection, processing and marketing will
enhance supply of local species. There are in many W oredas forest areas owned by either the state or
the community. These sources can be effectively utilized if such organized groups are engaged is the
seed production Endeavour. It serves two purposes: the first is creating li velihood opportunities and
the second one is reducing the grave shortage of forest tree seeds
Observable characteristics of a good seed source (site and mother tree)
The first step in good seed procurement practice is to obtain your seeds from well -identified locations
and to make good records of the sources. The next step is to examine the quality of the seed source.
There are a number of basic conditions that must be fulfilled if an area is to be considered as a seed
source:
 The conditions of the localit y of the seed source must match as closely as possible the
conditions of the locality where it is planned to plant the trees you will grow from the seeds;
 The trees must be sufficiently old and big so that the health, vigour, flowering and quality of
the product we are looking for can be satisfactorily evaluated;
 The trees must be healthy and vigorous. The appearance of the trees in respect of the end use
(i.e. timber, fuel, fodder, fruit, etc.) must not be inferior to trees of the same species found in oth er
areas in the neighborhood (see Fig 3 below);
Figure 3: Selection of superior phenotypic seed tree

31
 In years of good climatic conditions most of the trees in the area must flower and set fruit;
 If they do not, the genetic and physical quality of the seeds obtained is not likely to be
satisfactory. In the case of plantations, there must be confirmatory records of the health and
vigour of the trees. If there is no information about the origin of the trees in the plantation
from which you plan to collect seed, then only use the source temporarily until a better one
can be located;
 In the case of naturally occurring stands, the location must provide at least 30 healthy and
vigorous trees, or groups of trees, spaced at approximat ely 100m. Trees growing close
together are assumed to be related, therefore, it is better to collect seeds from trees that are far
apart which represent wider genetic variation;
 In plantations there must also be a minimum of 30 healthy and vigorous trees. However, there
is no requirement for a minimum spacing other than the spacing required for good crown
development, good flower and fruit production. In plantations, neighboring trees are assumed
not to be closely related provided the seed from where the tr ees originated were collected
properly;
 If collecting seeds from 30 trees, or groups of trees, does not provide a sufficient amount of
seed, and then do the following:
o In plantations, simply increase the area you collect from until the demand for seed is
met. As an alternative, other areas may be located. In natural stands, collect from
trees in between the 30 initially selected trees but make sure you collect from
specimens in all directions around the initial 30 trees.
 The source must be reasonably easy to reach with a veh icle. Only if there is no other choice
should an inaccessible location be chosen as a seed source; and
 It should be possible to protect the seed source from destruction or damage such as by
browsing, cutting and lopping by humans, or fire.
Seed collection techniques
There are various methods for collection of tree seed. In each case the choice of method depends on
many factors, for example type of fruit, kind of tree, stand and site characteristics, amounts to be
collected, available equipment, safety, weather and, of course, the skills of the staff available. Details
of techniques and methods will not be discussed here. But only some important points to remember
when planning and carrying out seed collections are mentioned below.
Four rules are important when locating seed trees and when collecting seed:
i) Any tree you collect from must be healthy and show vigorous growth;
ii) Avoid collecting the earliest maturing fruits or seeds or those that have fallen to the
ground. Such seeds are often d amaged by insects or are empty. If there is no alternative,
then check a representative sample of seeds to see if they are viable;
iii) In the case of fruits that have a soft moist pulp (pericarp), do not collect those that have
become brown or black, or where the pulp has dried out or become fermented; and
iv) Avoid collecting fruits or seeds that have come into contact with the soil as this will often
result in the seed being contaminated with various fungi (see Fig. 2 below)

32
Figure 4: seed collection in the crown (climbing)
Seed processing
The collected seeds need to be dried to the required moisture content prior to storage. Do not store wet
or fleshy seeds and fruits since they easily rot and get spoiled. Therefore, the collected seed s must be
spread over canvas or mats for drying in the sun and air. During the drying process, turning over of
the seeds until they are fairly dried is necessary. To separate some seeds from their fruits, threshing
and winnowing may be required. After the seeds are well sorted, they should be packed in sacks or
bags and stored in a dry place.
Seed processing may require also extraction from the fruits or pods and drying them before sawing. If
seeds are enclosed in a fleshy fruit, remove the flesh with knife, wash off the rest under water and sow
the seeds immediately. For seeds in a seed pod, such as Luceana leucocephala, let the pods split open
naturally by laying them in a semi -shade place. Similarly for other fruits with hard coat, drying them
in semi-shade or gentle cracking could be applied.
Storage of seed
The seed storage needs to be free from moisture, a well-ventilated and raised bed and free from pests.
In order to keep the seed cool, storage along a wall facing a south westerly direction should be
avoided since this wall tends to be warmer than the other walls during the afternoon. Also seed should
not be stored too high in the building because hot air will concentrate under the roof. The sack, jars, or
boxes with the seed must be placed in such way that air can circulate around each container. For this
purpose shelves can be placed in the store.  Some seeds can be dried to low moisture content of about
5% and be stored successfully at low temperatures. Others cannot survive drying below 20 -50%
moisture content. Therefore, seed storage requires the knowledge of the nature of the species. Several
species of leguminous and other plants have high longevity (surviving for long years), For example,
seeds of Acacia, Albizia, Cassia, Leucaena, Prosopis, Hibscus etc, can be successfully stored for more
than 20 years.
5.2 Preparing seed for sowing
5.2.1 Seed pre-sowing treatment
After collection, seeds from many forest trees are completely or partially dormant; they are not ready
for immediate germination. These seeds need pre-treatment before sowing. Dormancy has evolved in
trees to help their survival and spreading into new areas. A good example is Balanites aegyptica, a
scattered pioneer species occurring in semi -arid and arid low lands throughout the Sud ano-Sahelian
belt. If the seeds drop under the mother tree, they will hardly germinate. The fruit of Banalities must
first be eaten by animals such as goats before the seeds inside the fruits are ready to germinate. Seeds
that have passed through the intes tinal tract of ruminants (especially goats) particularly germinate
well.

33
There are 5 different categories of seed dormancy (Maydell 1986):
 Seed coat dormancy,
 Embryo dormancy,
 Immature embryo,
 Induced or secondary dormancy, and
 Double dormancy, combining two or more of the above strategies.
Seed coat dormancy is the most common in dry land species, and it occurs in many legumes (like
acacias). The hard seed coat prevents the uptake of moisture, and it must be softened or broken down
by pre-treatment.
Dormancy caused by hard seed coat can be overcome by several methods. In a large nursery the most
practical way is to immerse seeds in boiling water that is 4 to 6 times the volume of the seed lot. The
water and seeds are then allowed to cool for 24 hours. After this, they are ready for sowing. This is the
usual practice with Acacia decurrence. There are various treatments which can be applied to seed to
reduce seed dormancy so that germination becomes more rapid and uniform. This naturally helps to
simplify nursery management, and also makes it more efficient and, therefore, cheaper to raise
seedlings. The types of seed pre-treatment can include the following.
Scarification
The objective of the scarification method is to reduce the thickness of the seed coa t so that it becomes
more permeable to water. This can be achieved by nicking, filing, rubbing with sandpaper or rough
stones. This method is time consuming and so is usually only used with larger seeds and when the
seed source is scarce or valuable. If a cement mixer is available it is possible to scarify large quantities
of seed by tumbling the seed with gravel or sand. The nick in the seed coat should be made opposite
the point where the seed was attached to the pod; this point is often a tiny light-coloured spot at one
end of the seed. The nick should be no more than 1mm square to ensure that the embryo is not
damaged. Soaking the seed in cold water for 24 hours before sowing, but after scarification, should
further hasten germination.
An extreme type of scarification is practiced by removal of the whole seed shell; this is usual with the
seed of Olea europaea subsp. africana, and should also be tried with Zizyphus species. Cracking of
the seed shell must be done with great care so that the seed itself is not damaged in the process.
Soaking in water
Hot water : Seed-coat dormancy of many leguminous species can be successfully overcome by
treating with hot water. This is a quick and easy method and allows the treatment of a large number of
seeds economically. A typical treatment might be carried out as follows:
 Boil some water—about 10 times the volume of the seed to be treated;
 Remove water from heat and immediately place the seed in the water; and
 Allow the water to cool gradually with the seeds in it.
The seed should be sown immediately and not dried or stored. Sometimes, soaking for further 24
hours will improve germination rates and speed. The precise temperature of the hot water into which
seeds should be immersed varies with species, as does the most suitable period for soaking. Do not
allow the water to heat to boiling point as this is injurious to most species.
Cold water : Many seeds germinate readily after soaking for 24 hours in water at ambient
temperature. Prolonged soaking may benefit some species, but unless the water is changed daily there
is risk of injurious effect on the seed. The use of running water to leach out inhibitors from the seed is
also an effective pre-treatment for some species. A useful way to separate viable seed from non-viable
seed and chaff is to float the seed in cold water. Viable seed are heavy and tend to sink, while non -
viable seed are light and tend to float.

34
Chemical treatments
A wide range of chemicals have been used for seed pre-treatment, including acids, hydrogen peroxide,
potassium nitrate, silver nitrate, potassium permanganate and a variety of trace elements. The most
widely used of the chemical methods is the use of concentrated commercial sulphuric acid. The seed
is soaked in the acid for a period long enou gh to weaken and soften the seed coat but without
damaging the seed. A period of 10 minutes may be sufficient, but up to 1 hour may be necessary for
maximum germination in some species. After removal from the acid, the seed must be thoroughly
washed to ensure that all the acid is rinsed off the seeds.
The species which respond well to acid treatment are usually those which also respond well to
scarification or treatment with boiling water (e.g. hard -coated leguminous seed), and it is often
reported that equally good results can be achieved by any of these methods. Which method you chose,
therefore, may depend mainly on which method is most convenient. The danger posed by the use of
concentrated acid by unskilled workers is, however, a serious disadvantage. The dangers of acid to
safety of workers and equipment’s suggest it should not be used for routine pre-treatment of seeds.
5.2.2 Time of sowing
If seed can be stored for some time without undue loss of viability, then you can be flexible in
deciding convenient sowing dates. If, on the other hand, seed rapidly loses viability in storage (e.g.
Azadirachta indica) it should be sown as soon as possible after collection. If seed can be stored, then
the sowing date is primarily determined by the anticipated date of planting and the size of the target
seedling that is desired at that time. In the Ethiopian highlands the seedlings should be ready for
planting any time after the beginning of July, by which time the rainy season is usually established
and labour for planting has been organized.
The target seedling at planting time should be about 30 cm tall if 15-cm long tubes are used and about
40 cm tall with 20-cm long tubes. The sowing date can then be decided if we know how long it takes
to produce a seedling of s uch height. The time to grow the required seedling is subtracted from the
planting date and this provides the sowing date. In order to decide what will be the correct sowing
date you should allow sufficient time for the following: pre-treatment of seed before sowing, sowing,
germination, pricking-out, growing seedlings to the required size, hardening-off, and grading.
The time required for several of the above operations is very much dependent on the species grown.
This applies especially to the time requi red for germination and the time required to growing a given
species to the required size. Time required for hardening -off should be about a month, but this is an
operation which is frequently not allowed for in the calculations used to decide sowing dates . The
environmental conditions at a particular nursery also affect the growth rates of seedlings, the most
important being temperature, which is highly correlated with elevation. Other environmental factors
of some importance are wind, relative air humidit y and frosts or minimum temperatures. Frost in
particular may dictate that sowing time. Frost sensitive species are delayed until at least February, by
which time the probability of frost is reduced. The best guide to sowing dates should be based on the
experience obtained at each individual nursery from the results of previous years. The use of a
production calendar showing the dates of sowing, pricking -out, etc., is most useful to record current
operations and help to plan operations for the following year.
If a large amount of seed needs to be sown, it should not all be sown at the same time because there
will be a peak in germination and many seedlings attaining the same size. Unless there is abundant
suitable casual labour, it will be difficult to pric k-out all the seedlings at the correct time. It is,
therefore, advisable to sow large seed lots over a period of several weeks. This will also help to
produce more uniform plants at planting time because the seedlings produced from the earlier sowings
can be planted before those from later sowings.
If the sowing date is too early, large plants with a poor root/shoot ratio will be produced. This
situation can be partly salvaged by shoot pruning of excessively long seedlings. Most broad -leaved
species, including Acacia and Eucalyptus, can be shoot pruned once or even twice and this restores a

35
more favourable root/shoot ratio, which is helpful for obtaining good survival after planting. If sowing
is done too early, it will be necessary to root -prune repeatedly and this adds to the cost of raising
seedlings. Hardening-off should be started earlier than initially anticipated if it appears that otherwise
the seedlings will be too large at planting time. This should result in control of further height growth
while allowing some increase in diameter of the seedling stems, and so good quality seedlings can still
be produced.
If sowing is done too late, the seedlings will be too small at optimum planting time and it is likely that
there will be no time for hardening -off. This combination of small, unhardenedseedlings is likely to
result in poor survival after planting. From the above considerations it is evident that sowing too late
is likely to present worse problems than sowing slightly too early. Early sowing should help to
produce well -hardened seedlings, but nursery costs will be higher because of higher labor costs
incurred over a longer growing period. If there is insufficient labor to effectively root -prune, great
care should be taken with determination of sowing dates so that overgrown plants with poor root
systems are not produced as a result of sowing too early.
5.2.3 Sowing methods
When deciding on raising tree seedlings there are two basic options available. One consists of sowing
seed directly into the container in which the seedling will remain in the nursery. The alternative is to
sow seed at a relatively high density into seedbeds or seed trays where they germinate and are allowed
to grow for only a short time before being pricked -out (transplanted) indivi dually into new tubes.
Some species are better suited to grow in pots and others can be conveniently grown as bare -root
seedlings, while many species can be raised by either system.
Although direct sowing is usually more convenient, sometimes it is necess ary to use seedbeds or seed
trays and to prick -out the seedlings. A major advantage is that germination of seed can be
concentrated in a small area, rather than spread through the whole nursery. This allows specialized
techniques to be used under close supervision. In particular, improvements can be made to the sowing
medium and to watering, shade and protection from insects, diseases and rodents. Seedbeds or seed
trays are also recommended when:
 Viability is expected to be low (less than 40%);
 Germination is prolonged and erratic;
 Seed is very small, e.g. Eucalyptus;
 The seed is scarce or expensive; and
 Several plants germinate from one stone, e.g. Melia azedarach.
Sowing directly into pots
For seeds which are large enough to be handled individually, and wh ich usually have a good
germination rate, direct sowing of one or more seed into pots is often the best method. A particular
advantage of direct sowing is that root damage and root deformation, which can result from pricking -
out, are avoided. Genera that a re usually sown in this way include Acacia, Lucaena, Balanites and
Azadirachta. Pots should be thoroughly watered on the evening of the day before and lightly again
after sowing. After seed is sown, watering should only be done with a watering can that is fitted with
a rose that has small holes and, therefore, delivers a fine water spray which does not cause soil erosion
and possible seed displacement. This is especially important for smaller -seeded species where the
seed is close to the surface.
The forem en use coarse water roses because watering is faster, and if it is done with shades or
mulches these do help to reduce the erosive impact of coarse water sprays. After shades are removed,
however, it is essential to use fine water sprays for germinating se eds and small seedlings. The seed
should be sown in the centre of the tube at a depth equal to 2 -3 times its smallest dimension, but in
any case the top of the seed should be no more than 10 mm below the surface.
It is usually necessary to sow two or mor e seeds in each pot. The right number depends on the
germination rate expected. It is wasteful to sow too many seeds and this also results in greater

36
thinning costs at a later date. As a general rule, sow 1 -2 seeds per tube if field germination capacity
(FGC) is expected to be over 80%, 2 seeds if germination is 60 -80 %, and 3 seeds if germination is
40-60 %. Seed with less than 40% germination should be sown in seedbeds and pricked -out. If
germination capacity is over 80% half the pots should be sown with 1 seed, the other half with 2
seeds. The extra seedlings can then be used to prick -out into any empty tubes. Some species, such as
Rhamnus prinoides (ghesho), are difficult to prick-out and should, therefore, be directly sown.
After germination there will be 0, 1, 2, or more seedlings in each pot. When germination is almost
finished, prick-out plants from pots that have more than one seedling into pots without any germinant.
This may still leave some pots with more than one seedling. If the extra seedlings are not removed,
they must share the nutrients, moisture and light that are available for one pot and as a result inferior
plants will be produced. During germination, twice daily watering is usually required, but as soon as
roots penetrate a little into the soil it can be reduced to once per day.
Direct sowing is frequently also used for species with fine seed such as eucalyptus and Casuarina.
The technique consists of first loosening the surface soil in the tubes, which is hard because it was
previously compacted during pot filling. This loosening is done by careful digging to a limited depth
with a wooden dibble or similar stick. Next, a "pinch" of seed held between thumb and forefinger is
placed in the tube and the top stirred with a dibble or similar item. Sometimes a small amount of soil
is also added to the pot after sowing.
If non -compacted tubes are used there is no need to dig up the surface of the potting mix, which
creates an irregular surface not conducive to even germination. If the germinati on rate of the seed is
known it can be appropriately diluted with fine sand or, preferably, with sawdust (sieved through a 2 -
mm mesh sieve). A practicable method is to carry out germination tests with a small volume of seed,
and then to use the same volume for application of diluted seed to each pot. Simple arithmetic will
indicate the degree of dilution required to obtain an average of 2-3 seedlings per tube.
Sowing in seedbeds
For preparation of seedbeds the essential requirements are good drainage, light texture, and absence of
pests and pathogens. The sowing methods for seedbeds are similar to those used for seed trays, as
described above. However, the use of sup -irrigation is more difficult with seedbeds and is not
recommended. Also, because seedbeds are fixed, they are less flexible than seed trays which can
easily be moved to make work more convenient.
Sowing of small -seeded species should be done by broadcasting not sowing in lines which is more
wasteful of space and produces less uniform seedlings due to crowding along sowing lines. Larger -
seeded species (for which seedbeds are not usually employed) should be sown individually in lines
which are established running across the beds.

MODULE 6: SEEDLING PRODUCTION
Seedlings can be raised in containers (pots or tubes), or as bare -root seedlings grown directly in the
soil beds at the nursery site. Some species are better suited to grow in pots and others can be
conveniently grown as bare-root seedlings, while many species can be raised by e ither system. There
are many factors to consider when selecting the most appropriate system for raising seedlings of
different species. It is important to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the two (potted or
bare rooted) alternatives before deciding which to use.
6.1. Propagation
Trees are propagated either vegetative or from seeds. Seedlings can be collected from natural
regeneration or artificially produced in the nursery. Those types of trees that can be propagated from
coppices, root suckers etc. are the ones that can be reproduced naturally but producing seedlings from
seeds in the nursery requires proper management and tending operations.
6.1.1 Seed propagation
The aim of seed propagation is usually to produce more plants. There are other m ethods of seedling
productions such as the use of plant cuttings or root cuttings, but the use of seeds tends to be the most
common. Seed propagation is a technique used all over the world.
Many people buy seeds they want to propagate in the same manner that they buy other gardening
supplies. Some people collect the seeds from existing plants that they select for reproductions. The
condition of the seed is very important because unhealthy seeds can produce unhealthy plants or may
not grow at all. For this reason it is necessary to make sure the seeds obtained are not diseased or out-
dated. There are also other factors that can have a negative effect on viability of seeds. One example
is foreign origin seeds. Some seeds originated from one country may not b e able to grow in certain
other countries.
Another factor that plays a major role in seed propagation is the soil conditions. In order to be
successful, the seeds generally need to be placed in soils that are well aerated and have good moisture.
They need also to be placed at a depth that is conducive to their growth.
Despite all of the conditions, it is rare for seed propagation to have a 100 % success rate. In addition,
there are some plants that can only be reproduced by seed and, on the contrary, th ere are some plants
that cannot be reproduced by this method. Generally , seedlings can be grown in nurseries in 3
different ways
 From seed in plastic pots or as bare rooted;
 From cuttings, usually as bare rooted, or can be propagated; and
 Through direct sowing
Potted seedlings
During the past 20 years, the manual production of potted stock has been well-adapted in every region
of Ethiopia. Potted seedlings have clear advantages.
Advantages
 The chain of seedling production is simple to teach to casual labo ur. Many stages of the work
can be paid on a piece-rate basis and nursery management becomes simple;
 Potted seedlings can endure longer transport perio ds than bare rooted seedlings; t he roots are
not exposed to air drying during lifting, transporting and planting;
 Under Ethiopian climatic conditions and with difficult planting sites, the survival of potted
seedlings is better than with bare rooted stock;
 The time in the nursery is usually less than for bare-root stock;
 They require less space in the nursery than bare-root seedlings of the same size;

38
 The availability of good soil at the nursery site is not an essential requirement as potting mix
ingredients can be imported into the nursery;
 Soil-borne diseases are likely to spread more slowly than in bare-root seedlings;
 A longer planting period is possible than with bare-root seedlings; and
 Satisfactory results are possible with a relatively untrained planting labour force.
Disadvantages
 A great deal of soil is needed to fill the tubes and also a significant amount of soil must be
transported with the pots;
 They require regular root-pruning in the nursery;
 They are heavy to transport and, consequently, reliable and timely transport to the
reforestation site during the planting season is necessary;
 They are more complicated to raise seedlings especially if seeded in germination beds before
pricking-out into tubes;
 The lack of availability of plastic tubes may be a bottleneck. Containers must be purchased;
this will incur some cost and requires appreciable forw ard planning if they need to come from
overseas;
 They are more expensive to produce than bare-root seedlings; and
 Foliage and shoot diseases are likely to be more severe due to closer spacing of seedlings
resulting in higher air humidity.
The advantages, however, outweigh the disadvantages, and the final result is vigorous saplings in the
field that grow into fully stocked stand.
Bare rooted stock
Bare rooted stock is not common in tropical countries. This method is better suited to temperate zones
where seedlings have winter dormancy. During dormancy periods, seedlings can be transported easily,
and they can also be stored temporarily at the planting site to wait for planting. In tropical climates,
even the transport of bare rooted seedlings, let alone th e storage, is difficult because of their non -
dormant nature. Bare rooted stock, however, is cheaper to produce than potted stock. The method of
bare rooted seedlings has not yet been fully exploited, and it is possible that it will have a future in the
planting programs in the moist western regions of Ethiopia.
Advantages
 They are normally less complicated to grow in the nursery;
 They are not so heavy; therefore more seedlings can be loaded on a vehicle for transport to
the plantation sites;
 Each planter can carry more seedlings to the planting site;
 They are well suited to mechanization, which is an advantage if labour costs are high;
 They are well suited to large centralized nurseries for economical seedling production; and
 They are cheaper to produce than potted seedlings.
Disadvantages
 They usually have a lower survival rate than potted seedlings when planted on unfavourable
sites;
 The roots are susceptible to air drying during lifting, transporting and planting and therefore
require more care and supervision during these operations;
 They require more space in the nursery than potted seedlings;
 They need a little more time in the nursery;
 They are more complicated to store at the planting site if, for any reason, planting cannot be
done immediately;
 The nursery must have good soil conditions. It is especially important that the soil texture be
light and that drainage is good;

39
 Planting time is more restricted than for potted seedlings; and
 Root diseases are more likely to become a problem because pathogen po pulations can build
up during successive years of using the same soil.
Experience world-wide, indicates that in a semi -arid environment (i.e. with unreliable rainfall below
700 mm per year) survival and establishment is usually improved if containerized ( not bare-rooted)
seedlings are used. This is especially so if the bare -rooted seedlings are planted on poor soils where
watering after planting is not practicable.
Bare-root seedlings, stumps and wildings
Bare-root, or open -root, seedlings are cheaper to produce and plant than stock grown in containers,
but they also have numerous disadvantages. The main requirements for successfully using bare -root
seedlings are favourable climate and soils, and the availability of reliable transport and labour for
planting. These limitations make the use of bare -root stock of limited applicability. A few highland
nurseries have grown Eucalyptus globulus and Acacia saligna as bare -root stock for use by
individuals who are able to provide watering after planting. Some speci es like Azadirachta indica
(neem) are often produced successfully as bare -root plants even in dry climates. Many aspects of
growing bare-root plants are similar to production of container stock, but there are also some major
differences.
Bare-root seedlings are grown directly in the soil present at the nursery site. Therefore, this soil must
be of a suitable sandy loam texture and the site must be very well drained. If repeated crops of
seedlings are envisaged, it will be necessary to add some compost, man ure or chemical fertilizer
annually to replace the nutrients removed with the seedlings. The soil must be cultivated to a depth of
30 cm and weeds should be eliminated.
Plant density and area required :Plants should be grown in rows 20 -25 cm apart, and spa cing
between seedlings should be 5 -10 cm. The area required for bare -root seedlings is, therefore, much
greater than that required for tubed seedlings. There should be 50 -100 bare -root plants per square
meter, compared to 100 per square meter with 10-cm diameter tubes.
Sowing and pricking -out:Species with large seeds can be sown directly into beds, but for smaller -
seeded species pricking-out (transplanting) is preferred. If direct sowing is used, it is important to thin
seedlings to the required spacing of 5-10 cm between plants at an early age so that there is no undue
competition.
If pricking-out is done, it should use similar methods to those described for tubed seedlings.
As there is more room in the open -root bed, it is possible to make larger holes f or receiving the roots
of the seedlings; therefore the roots can be slightly larger than those used in tubes. Seedlings with
roots 5-10 cm long and shoots 3—5 cm tall are suitable for pricking out to produce bare-root stock.
Root-pruning:This is an essential operation which must be repeated several times during the growing
period. Root-pruning can be done by inserting a spade at an angle of about 45 degrees and a distance
of approximately 10 cm from the stem of the seedling and lifting slightly after inserting the spade into
the soil. This must be done from both sides of the seedling to effectively cut or break roots which
have become too long. In addition, insert the spade vertically between seedlings to cut roots that are
growing along the direction of the row. This root-pruning should be repeated at intervals of about six
weeks.
Lifting and packing:A spade or flat-pronged fork is inserted vertically about 10 cm from the seedling
and pushed deep enough to permit lifting the plant with the majority of its r oot system intact. The soil
is removed by carefully shaking the seedling, and any long roots are pruned with a sharp knife. After
grading, which should include an assessment of the root system to ensure it is well developed and in
balance with the size of the shoot, plants are packed. It is essential that the roots are not allowed to

40
become dry at any time, so work should be under shade as far as possible. Use of well -watered sacks,
grasses, sawdust, etc helps to keep the roots moist and healthy.
After thi s, wrap the roots well in plastic bags to further reduce evaporation. Time taken before
seedlings are planted should be as short as possible to minimize desiccation of seedlings. Unless
seedlings are of very high quality, watering in any dry spell after pl anting may be essential to obtain
satisfactory survival and establishment.
Preparation of grass seedlings from seed
Grass seedlings are raised in a nursery the same way as bare rooted tree seedlings are raised. The
seedlings are produced in raised seedbeds of 10m x 10m. The beds should be fine and firm to prevent
burial/loss of seeds due to big clods and soil movement. In order to make fine seed beds, the clods
should be thoroughly eliminated during seedbed preparation. The seedbeds prepared in dry weather
conditions could easily be destabilized and the seeds could be buried because of the movement of dry
soil.
To avoid the possibility of burying the seeds, the seedbeds prepared in dry weather should be watered
one day before planting. This activity stabil izes the seedbeds and avoids the burying of seeds due to
soil movement. The seed is then broadcast on the seedbed the same way described for the
establishment of grass strips by broadcasting. The seedling should be properly watered and weeded
while in the nursery. It nearly takes three months before the seedlings are ready for field planting. The
seedlings should be carefully uprooted and handled during planting. Only those seedlings that can be
planted on the same day should be uprooted in one day. The upr ooted seedlings should be covered
with mulches or stored under shade before planting.
6.2 Vegetative propagation
Vegetative propagation is the production of new plants directly from vegetative parts of existing ones,
not from seeds. There are numerous meth ods of vegetative propagation including cuttings, layering ,
division and grafting. The techniques involved in vegetative propagation are usually more technical
than propagations using seeds.
Vegetative, or asexual, propagation is used to produce a plant i dentical in genotype with the source
(mother) plant. This is in contrast to propagation from seed where every individual has a different
genotype and may, therefore, have properties quite different from the mother plant. Vegetative
reproduction is the production of new plants directly from vegetative parts of existing plants.There are
four broad categories of methods which can be used in vegetative reproduction:
Cuttings and layers
This is a method in which new roots and shoots are developed on sections of shoot, root or leaves
taken from the mother plant.
Grafting and budding
This is a method in which the root system of one plant is joined with the shoot of another plant to
form a single composite plant, which in effect has two genotypes.
Division and separation
This is a method in which naturally formed special vegetative structures such as rhizomes, runners,
suckers, tubers, bulbs, corms, or bulbils, are used to produce new plants.
Micro propagation
This method (also known as "tissue culture" or "in -vitro culture") is a relatively new technique in
which new plants are produced from very small structures (embryos, shoot tips, meristems) in aseptic
cultures. The method requires considerable technical expertise and equipment but has great potential

41
to prod uce very large numbers of identical seedlings. It is now used in several counties for
establishment of extensive commercial forest plantations with genera such as Eucalyptus, Pinus and
Populus. Associated with micro propagation are techniques of genetic en gineering which enable
further improvements in producing genotypes which have desired ecological and commercial
properties. Such technologies have become an important aspect of modern plant propagation and
breeding and are included in the term "biotechnology".
Reasons for using vegetative propagation
Seed is not always available, germination of some seeds is difficult, or successful nursery techniques
for a given species (seed) have not been developed;
 An individual mature plant may exhibit very desirable features (e.g. fast growth rate, disease
resistance, drought or salinity tolerance, abundant fruit etc) which are genetically determined;
 Multiplication of such individuals, maintaining the exact genotype of the mother plant, is
possible only with vegetative reproduction. These genetically identical individuals form a "clone".
Cloning thus provides for multiplication of specific selected genotypes;
 The members of the clone should all exhibit the desirable features of the mother plant if they are
grown in a similar environment. This represents a much faster method of genetic improvement
than is possible through conventional breeding programs based on sexual reproduction and
growing successive generations from seed;
 Fruit trees will have the superior quality and quantity of fruit that is evident in the mother tree;
 The age at which fruit trees start to bear fruit is reduced. In general, vegetative reproduction
results in earlier maturity;
 It helps to combine the advantageous qualities of two plants by graftin g or budding. For
example, this enables the shoot to be from a tree which produces a high yield of quality fruit while
the root system comes from a tree that is vigorous and disease resistant. This is the reason why the
majority of fruit trees in temperate countries are reproduced by vegetative methods;
 In contrast, the majorities of fruit trees in tropical countries are still of seedling origin, and
hence often have reduced quality and quantity of fruit;
 Artificial hybrids between two species may have good commercial properties but their seed is
often sterile. Vegetative propagation may offer the only practicable method for multiplication of
such hybrids; and
 If micro-propagation is used, a large supply of planting material can be produced in a short time
from very little mother plant tissue.
There are also disadvantages which may be associated with vegetative reproduction:
 Disease transmission is often associated with vegetative methods. This is especially relevant for
viral pathogens which are transmitted through sap. Viruses are relatively rare in forest trees but are
quite common in fruit trees. This problem of pathogen transmission, especially with grafting or
budding, can be reduced by ensuring that only specially selected pathogen -free mother trees a re
used.
 Genetic uniformity within monoclonal plantations can lead to uniform susceptibility to insects,
diseases or other environmental hazards. Such a monoculture can be particularly vulnerable to the
introduction of a new pest or pathogen into the local ity, and it might result in extensive losses of
plants.
 The technical skill and equipment required to effectively implement vegetative propagation is
often greater than that required for propagation from seed.
Cuttings (Vegetative propagation)
Cuttings are sections of stems, roots, branches, leaves or twigs gathered from suitable mother trees or
shrubs. They are placed with part of their length in a suitable rooting medium to induce the formation
of new roots at the basal end and the development of leaves and shoots on the upper portion. A cutting
thus grows into a new individual plant which is a clone of the mother plant.

42
Cuttings are the most important means of propagating ornamental trees and shrubs, deciduous as well
as evergreen species. For species that can be propagated easily by cuttings, this method has numerous
advantages. Many new plants can be produced in a limited space from a few mother plants. The
method is inexpensive, rapid and simple and does not require the special techniques required fo r
grafting, budding or micro propagation. There is no problem of incompatibility with rootstock or of
poor graft unions. Greater uniformity is obtained by absence of the variation which sometimes
appears as a result of the variable seedling rootstocks of g rafted plants. Among the grasses, elephant
grass is propagated by cuttings.
There are several types of cuttings, which are classified according to the part of the plant fro m which
the parts were obtained. These are:  stem cuttings, stem cuttings are further subdivided into hardwood,
semi-hardwood, softwood and herbaceous, root cuttings and leaf cuttings.
Cuttings are grown in special beds called propagation beds. Propagation beds for cuttings have to
provide excellent environmental conditions that are not only favourable for the formation of new
roots, but also for all other life processes within the newly developing plant. The most important
environmental factors for successfully growing (striking) cuttings are proper soil aeration (good
oxygen supply), adequate moisture content of the rooting medium, as well as a high humidity of the
atmosphere, good light conditions and a favourable soil and air temperature. After root growth is
initiated, it is also important that there are sufficient nutrients availabl e to enable continued root and
shoot growth.
6.3. Direct sowing
Direct seeding establishes trees, shrubs, and under storey plants by sowing seed directly onto the site
to be re-vegetated. Whether it is sowing by machine or by hand, a good site preparation and effective
weed control are essential for the success.
6.3.1 Advantages
The advantages of direct seeding over seedling planting are many:
 Direct seeding is much cheaper (10 - 20% or less of the cost of planting tube stock), and requires
minimal labour.
 Existing farm equipment can be used.
 Higher plant density after germination provides better shelter to new seedlings and reduces weed
competition. It also allows natural selection to sort out the stronger from the weaker plants without
creating gaps to be replanted.
 Plants are able to “self -select” suitable establishment sites within the re -vegetation area,
particularly if a mixture of species is sown.
 The plants are usually healthier and have stronger, deeper root systems because they are not
transplanted and there is no disturbance to root growth. This enables plants to be more tolerant of
stressful conditions such as pest attack and drought.
 Final plant cover is random, and looks more natural than planting.
 Little maintenance is required after plants are established, apart from ongoing weed control for at
least the first season.
6.3.2 Disadvantages
The disadvantages of direct seeding are:
 Direct seeding is limited to plants that grow readily from seed;
 A large amount of seed is required. Hence, if only mi nimal seed is available for a particular
species, it may be better to raise seedlings for that species in a nursery;
 Plants germinating under field conditions are extremely vulnerable. Frosts, spring droughts, or
flooding of the sowed area can dramatically reduce seedling establishment; and
 The initial density of plants is harder to control. This may create undesirable spacing for quality
timber production, but can be overcome by “spot” sowing.

43
6.3.3 Uses for direct seeding
Direct seeding is suited to re-vegetate large areas for:
 Conservation structures on farmlands such as soil bunds, gully and fanyaa-juu;
 Rehabilitation of gullies and degraded areas; and
6.4. Production of grass splits and cuttings
6.4.1 Production of elephant grass and bana grass
Elephant grass can be reproduced by seed; however , seed yield of elephant grass is usually very
low,less than 1-2 kg/ha pure germinating seed. Because of low genetic stability and viability, elephant
grass is normally propagated from stem cuttings or root splits. Root splits generally take more labour
to prepare (uproot) and to plant but result in quicker establishment. Splits are planted like normal
seedlings. Using cuttings is the cheapest method of establishing elephant/bana grasses
When using cuttings, two n odes should be covered with soil and one node left exposed. Cuttings are
planted at an angle of 30-450. Cuttings can also be planted horizontally into a furrow, to a depth of 15-
20 cm. One hectare of elephant grass can provide propagating material enough f or 15 -25
hectares.Normally splits/cuttings are planted in rows or trenches 0.25 -0.5 m apart. Distance between
rows is 0.4-1 m.
6.4.2 Production of Vetiver
Vetiver rarely produces seed. Hence, the only reproduction method is through asexual means. Several
vegetative propagation methods are available throughout the world:a) using tillers: a shoots growing
from the base of the stem of the plant, b) using a c lum: bunch of tillers and c) using plantlet :
differentiated tiny plant developed through tissue culture technique.
Tillers are shoots growing from the base of the stem of the plant. It is the most popular part of the
plant used in propagation . Propagation in our country is commonly made using tillers. Tillers are
available in large quantity, convenient a nd are economical.Production of bare rooted seedling is the
most common multiplication method that is widely practiced in our country. The most important steps
are as follows:
 Prepare the land intended for multiplication: Water the plot the thoroughly bef ore planting, Prepare
open furrows, add compost or chemical fertilizer at the bottom before planting
 Prepare the planting material. After Collecting the clump form dependable sources (fully matured, 4
months old clump), divide the clumps in to smaller til lers, when dividing into tillers, it would be
advisable to separate where they tear best to avoid damages. Then t rim the shoots and roots to the
length of 20 and 10 cm receptively and soak the tillers in water for one day. Next bind the tillers
together in to bundle, cover them with jute sacks and spray water every morning to moisten it for
about 5-7 days until they develop roots.
 Planting. Plant two to three tillers per station along plating furrows.  Tillers should be placed in
double rows at 40 cm spacing between the plant and between rows.
Assuming a spacing of 40x40cm betwe en plant and rows respectively, In 0.16 m2 area, we will have
four stations and in 1 hectare there will be 62500 station or clumps. Each clump, if managed well, can
produce 40 -50 (Av erage 45) tillers after 4 -5 months . Hence, 62500 clumps  has 2,812,500 tillers.
This is enough for nearly 281 km of soil bund or Fanya-Juu.
6.4.3 Production of Desho grass
Desho grass can set seed but is usually established by splits. Propagating by splits have high survival
rates and establishes better than grasses which are seeded. The production of desho grass is similar
to desho grass. Splits are usually planted at a distance of 0.40 cm x 0.40 cm in a nursery .After 3-6
months (depending on management), one split planted can produce 20-50 splits.

44
6.5 Quality seedlings
Once a nursery is established, there are many management considerations relevant to the effective and
economical production of quality seedlings. Nursery management can be viewed as the day-today
activities which are performed within an annual time frame to produce maximum number of quality
seedlings in the most economical way. In order to effectively manage a nursery, the nursery manager
must have a clear idea of what type of planting stock the nursery should produce at the end.
The kind of high -quality drought -resistant seedlings that should be produced at the end can be
conveniently termed as "target seedlings". Such target seedlings have qualities that give them a high
probability of survival after planting and good growth rates after establishment.
The desirable characteristics of drought-resistant target seedlings can be specified as follows:
1. Seedling height is approximately twice the height of the container;
2. The root -collar (or stem diameter at soil level) should be thick in relation to the height
resulting in a sturdy seedling;
3. The root system should be well developed with an abundance of fine fibrous roots penetrating
the whole volume of the container. This will help to produce see dlings with a good root/shoot
ratio;
4. There should be minimal development of roots beyond the container, and a vigorous taproot
should not be allowed to grow below the container.
5. The seedlings should be adequately hardened-off so that by the time they are p lanted out they
will be adapted to conditions of full sunshine and moisture stress as well as low humidity and
increased wind;
6. The appropriate microbial symbionts should be present on the root system. This implies the
following for three different taxa of plant species:
a) Most legumes: should have macroscopically visible nodules formed by symbiosis with
Rhizobium bacteria, thus allowing nitrogen fixation. The presence of appropriate
mycorrhizae will further improve nutrient absorption and drought resistance.
b) Casuarina: should have macroscopically visible nodules formed by the Actinomycete
known as Frankia. This will allow symbiotic nitrogen fixation which would otherwise
does not occur. Again, the presence of mycorrhizae is beneficial to further stimulate
growth and drought resistance.
7. The seedlings should have desirable physiological characteristics, including the following:
a) High root-growth potential after planting;
b) Adequate starch and other food reserves in both stem and roots;
c) An adequate nutrient so there is no deficiency in either macro - or micronutrients, nor
an imbalance in their proportions;
d) Resistance to water logging. This can be important if heavy rains follow planting,
causing planting pits to become saturated. Larger plants are more tolerant of wat er
logging;
8. The root system should not have spiralling roots or other deformities which can lead to
problems after several years.
As far as possible, the target seedlings should possess all the above seven characteristics of a quality
seedling. To achieve this is the primary task of nursery management. Good supervision is essential to
the successful management of a nursery and requires good communication at all levels. Good
supervision costs little more than poor supervision but can have a profound influence on the quality of
the seedlings produced.

45
MODULE 7: NURSERY TENDING AND PROTECTION
7.1 Tending operation
Appropriate care of seedlings in the nursery is crucial for seedlingsurvival and growth after
outplanting. Important maintenance activities forse edlings in the nursery include mulching, shading,
watering, pricking-out, thinning, root pruning, weeding and hardening off.The major techniques are
describes as follows:
7.1.1. Mulching
Mulching is a protective covering of seeds by grass or locally avai lable materials to prevent the
evaporation of moisture, the freezing of roots, and the growth of weeds. Immediately after sowing,
mulching of the seedbed is done to protect the seeds from being washed away during watering and to
reduce evaporation and cons erve moisture.  Grass mulch or locally available materials are used as a
blanket for the germinating seeds. Fresh straw and grass used for covering sown pots may introduce
weed seeds, which will germinate under the favourable moisture conditions. Therefore , efforts should
be made to minimize the introduction of weed seed with the mulching material.
7.1.2 Shading
Seedlings in the early stage of their development, particularly from sowing to immediately after
picking out are sensitive to full sunlight, high temperatures, heavy rains and strong winds. Therefore,
they should be protected by shading, which is constructed from local materials i.e. branches, grasses,
etc. When seedlings are more resistant, shading is reduced gradually from all day to around mid - day,
and later to none at all. Shades could be constructed in removable forms for ease of management.
Shades reduce the day -time temperature and the rate of evaporation from soil and plants beneath
them. The humidity around the plants is also increased.
Shades should be 1.3 m wide to provide some overlap at the edge of the beds so that the "edge effect"
is minimized. The use of shading is often poorly managed; shades are often too dense (allowing about
5-10% of sunlight to penetrate), left on for too long, or left on at the wrong time.
Shading can be low or high. Low shades are most common in highland nurseries. They are temporary,
made of local material, cheap to erect, but they require plenty of manual labor support for low shades
can be made of bamboo poles. The cover is spread on the supports only 30 to 50cm above the ground.
Low shades are adjustable: as the seedlings grow bigger the shades are lifted by changing the supports
in to longer ones. Low shades have a disadvantage in that the shading mats or screens have to be
removed to water or weed the pots. Water applied on top of the mats or screens may seep down to the
seedlings as heavy drops that do not water the pots evenly and may even compact the soil.
High shades are elevated enough so that a labourer can move freely below them. High shades are
usually constructed as a permanent installation. They are built of poles or wooden posts about 2m
apart and connected at the top by longitudinal beams and cross beams. When seedlings are shaded,
shading mats or screens are placed on top of the scaffolding. High shades are not commonly used in
Ethiopia.
Shading mats, both for low and high shades can be locally made from bamboo slats. Local shading
mats can be prepared by the nursery staff during the silen t nursery season. Bamboo is cut into pieces
of about 1.20 m in length since the shading mat should be slightly wider than the standard nursery
bed. The bamboo poles are split lengthwise into slats of 15 to 20mm wide.
The slats are then connected with wire or string, and some space is left between each slat. The width
of the slats and the space left between determines the degree of shading the mats provide. A mat made
of 20mm wide slats with spacing between 20mm permits 50% light to pass through. If the str etches
between the slats are reduced to 10mm, shading rises to 67%. Handmade shading mats should not
exceed a length of 5m since longer mats are heavy and inconvenient to handle. Shading mats of a
suitable length can be spread easily and quickly rolled up when required.

46
Shade makes conditions more uniform throughout the 24 hours of the day. It also reduces light
reaching the plants and thus can decrease photosynthesis to unacceptably low levels if the shade is too
dense. If shades are left on too long or a re too dense this encourages the growth of tall, thin, weak
(etiolated) plants which may even have lost their healthy green colour and become yellowish
(chlorotic). The plants will also have low food reserves, which results in slower root regeneration after
planting. Such plants, which have been growing under comparatively cool, humid conditions and low
light intensity in the nursery, are subject to severe shock when they are planted out, especially if
subjected to hot or dry conditions. Their chances of survival will be much reduced.
Besides the adverse effects of shade on seedling quality mentioned above, shade also has a large
influence on disease development. Most fungal diseases thrive in conditions of high shade intensity,
which result in high air hum idity and longer periods of surface wetness of plant tissues. Excessive
shade, therefore, tends to encourage many diseases. Heavy textured potting mixes are especially
conducive to root rot, and high levels of shade further increase the severity of disease.
The adverse effects of excessive shade can often be clearly seen in nurseries because the healthiest
seedlings are evident at the edges of pot beds where they receive relatively more light than the central
part of the bed (the edge effect). There is oft en a consistent gradient from thicker -stemmed, taller,
healthy green seedlings at the edges of pot beds to thinner, shorter, chlorotic seedlings at the centre of
the bed. In many instances this is the result of excessive shade application. The central seed lings also
have a poorer root system, which is an inevitable result of high shading intensity. Consequently the
root/shoot ratio will be low and field survival can be expected to be lower than for seedlings raised
with plenty of sunshine. In spite of the above negative consequences of shading, there are situations in
the nursery when the use of shade is appropriate.
7.1.3 Watering
An ample supply of water is essential for a well-operating nursery. The water must be of good quality.
It should be clean, the pH value should range from neutral or slightly acidic (5.5 to 6.5) and there
should not be too much slat in it. Newly sown seed must not be allowed to dry out at any time as this
would kill many germinating seeds, especially when the radicles are just sta rting to emerge. To
maintain moist conditions it is usually necessary to water at least twice a day. If fine sand, which dries
out quickly, is used to cover the seed, more frequent watering might be required. If sown seed are not
shaded they will also require more frequent watering, and weather factors will obviously have a major
effect on rate of drying of seedbeds. Larger seed, which are sown deeper, will be less liable to rapid
drying than smaller seeds which are sown with only a thin covering of sand. T he seed germination
medium should not be too wet as this causes problems with aeration and damping-off. The experience
of the foreman and a well -drained germination mix are essential to ensure that there is adequate but
not excessive moisture during germination.
The watering of germinating seed and young seedlings must be done with a watering can which has a
hose with very fine holes so that it produces a fine water spray which does not disturb the germinating
seeds and their short, delicate root systems. W hen such fine hoses for watering cans are often not
available, the usual practice is to water with shades in place to break the force of an erosive coarse
water spray.
This is moderately effective in reducing erosion caused by the water spray. It is also difficult to
visually assess the relative dryness of soil when shades are in place, and uniform watering of the
whole bed is, therefore, more difficult. Shades also cause a degree of unevenness in watering because
they tend to concentrate water along drip lines created by the grass stalks. It is therefore important that
all nurseries have sufficient fine hoses to enable watering of young seedlings without shades in place.
The best fine spray is achieved by a watering can which has the rose with fine holes pointing upwards,
so that a very gentle spray that settles with minimum velocity is produced.
As seedlings grow progressively larger in the presence of adequate sunlight, they rapidly develop
roots into the lower portions of the potting mix, after which wa tering can be decreased to once per

47
day. Seedlings with 2 -3-m long shoots should have a sufficiently wel l-developed root system to
require watering only once a day. Even if the surface of the tube appears dry, lifting the tube will
indicate that there is m oisture available in the root zone of even quite small seedlings. Excessive
watering is often indicated by abundant growth of algae at the top and sides of tubes, which develop a
green colour as a result. Watering should be done late in the afternoon or ea rly in the morning to
minimize evaporation losses and to prevent leaf scalding, which can occur if seedlings are watered in
strong sunlight. If fungal diseases are a problem, it is best to water in the morning as any excess
moisture will be quickly evapora ted. If watering is done late in the afternoon, high moisture levels
conducive to disease are likely to be maintained for more time during the night thus leading to
increased disease severity.
When seedlings are growing well, it is essential that watering is sufficient to wet the potting mix in
the whole length of the tube. This may require several watering, allowing a few minutes for the water
to infiltrate the potting mix before watering again. If only the top of the tube is moistened there will
be very little root growth in the lower levels of the soil mix as they are likely to be too dry. This is
particularly relevant when using the longer (20 -cm) tubes. However, even with 15 -cm long tubes it is
common to find tubes with larger seedlings, which after ro utine watering, do only have the top 5 cm
of soil moistened. Frequent light watering (insufficient watering) not only restricts root development
but is also a waste of water because a high proportion of water lost by evaporation from the soil
surface. This also causes more rapid salt accumulation as salts are left at the upper part of the root
zone after water evaporated.
Thus, it is more economical and conducive for a better root development within the whole volume of
the tube if watering is thorough but less frequent. The foreman should lift a number of tubes at
random to examine how far the water infiltrated and make sure watering is continued until the whole
tube depth moistened. Watering is essential immediately after root -pruning to help the seedling
overcome the shock of losing part of its root system and to encourage growth of new fibrous roots.
Unless there is watering immediately after root -pruning, it is obvious seedlings tend to wilt quickly.
Thus, watering of seedlings before final dispatch to p lanting sites should be very thorough to ensure
that the seedling has the maximum available moisture reserves within its tube. Such moisture reserve
can be critical for survival if dry weather follows after planting in the field.
7.1.4 Pricking-out
If seeds have not been sown directly into pots, pricking-out (also known as transplanting) must always
be done. The aim of pricking -out is to establish a single vigorous seedling, centrally placed in each
pot, with minimal disturbance to continued growth of the s eedling. When pricking -out, one of the
most critical things is to use a size of seedling that is most likely to survive. If a seedling is too large,
it is difficult to lift it out with the majority of its roots intact, or to place this large root system in the
new pot without distortion to the roots. If a seedling is too small, it is very delicate and may have an
inadequate length of root.
In practice the hole made for receiving a new seedling should be about 5 cm deep and 1 -1.5 cm in
diameter. The correct size of seedling for transplanting should, therefore, be judged primarily by the
length of the roots, which should be about 5 cm long, rather than by the height of the shoot. Usually
the shoots of seedlings suitable for pricking -out have 2 -4 leaves beside s the cotyledons. If the roots
are approximately 5 -cm long, many potential problems associated with pricking -out can be avoided.
These include:
 A seedling with 5-cm long roots can be easily lifted with minimal loss of roots;
 Such a small root system does not require any root-pruning before it can be placed in the new
tube; and
 Such a small root system can be easily placed into its new position with little chance of root
deformation and distortion. Avoiding root deformation is very important as it can cause
permanently deformed root systems, which can in turn lead to death of the plant several years
after planting. This potential for root deformation is a major disadvantage of the pricking -out
method of growing seedlings.

48
It is an advantage if the seedlings t o be used for pricking -out are relatively hard. This is primarily
achieved by ensuring that they receive as much sunlight as they can tolerate, starting immediately
after germination. This helps to produce relatively robust seedlings with thicker stems tha t are less
easily damaged by handling with fingers. Most importantly, such seedlings with previous exposure to
high levels of sunlight have more vigorous roots and some ability to limit excessive water loss from
the shoot by transpiration. They, therefore, have a better chance of surviving the shock of pricking-out
than thin, weak seedlings such as those produced under dense shading.
Pricking-out is a delicate operation which should be done with great care, preferably by workers with
previous experience. I t is best if the whole transplanting operation can be done under shade, which
can be provided by having a moveable shade to protect both seedlings and workers. If this is not
possible, pricking-out should be restricted to the coolest times of the day, such as early morning and
late afternoon. Cloudy days with little wind are especially suitable for pricking -out, and on such days
this operation can be done throughout the whole day. Encourage workers doing the pricking -out to
discard any seedlings which do no t have a relatively well -developed root system when judged in
relation to the shoot. Some seedlings are genetically predisposed to having relatively poor roots and
the sooner such plants are eliminated from routine operations is the better. Even if they su rvive in the
nursery for several months, they have a low chance of survival after planting.
If the good techniques described above are followed, it should be possible to achieve over 80%
survival. Some nurseries do in fact achieve such good results, but m any experience significant losses
after pricking -out and typically have survival below 50%. The most common causes of mortality
following pricking-out are:
 Drying out of the roots in the time between lifting and replanting;
 Leaving air pockets around the r oots instead of ensuring that the roots are in close contact
with the soil;
 Waiting until seedlings are too large before transplanting. Then it is difficult to remove
sufficient roots to maintain a satisfactory root/shoot ratio;
 Pulling seedlings out of the soil without the use of a dibble stick to help remove roots intact;
 If seedlings are pulled out, it is common for this to result in the seedlings having only a
taproot and no lateral roots. In addition, the force required to pull the seedling frequently
causes mechanical stem damage, which in turn predisposes the plant to disease;
 Making a planting hole that is too shallow so the seedling is not planted deep enough. If roots
are exposed to air, they dry out rapidly and the seedling dies. Shallow holes also promote root
deformation;
 Making a planting hole that is too deep, resulting in the plant stem being partly buried, with
consequent greater chance of stem disease, especially if soils become too wet;
 Existence of extremely hot, sunny or windy weather c ondition especially if shading is
ineffective;
 Too little or too much watering. Excessive watering is especially a problem in heavy -textured
soils where root -rot disease is also likely to become important. Too little watering is more
likely when the potting mix is very well drained due to a sandy texture;
 Leaving dense shades in place for too long; and
 Since the growth of seedlings varies with altitude and rainfall, each nursery must determine -
species by species the time needed between sowing and seedlings reaching planting size.
7.1.5 Weeding
Competition from weeds for nutrients, light and moisture depresses seedling growth and can, if not
controlled, lead to seedling deaths. The competition for nutrients is especially critical in nurseries as
potting mixes contain only limited nutrients and symptoms of deficiency are common. Competition
for light is only important if weeds are allowed to grow unchecked and become large. Likewise,
competition for moisture increases as weeds increase in size, so the aim sho uld be to eliminate weeds
while they are still small. Weeds can also encourage some pests and diseases.

49
Weeds propagate either by seeds or by underground rhizomes and stems. Special attention must be
given to weeds with underground propagation. These are more difficult to eradicate, and they should
be removed with their rhizomes as soon as they appear. Construction of a wind breaks around the
nursery and hedges around the compartments decreases weed infestation by wind. Cutting adjacent
grassland before t he grasses flower decreases the spread of grass seed. Rhizome -infested nursery
compartments must be cleaned annually to remove all rhizomes before the nursery beds are laid out.
Compost and manure should be allowed to decompose well over a long period. An inside compost
temperature of about 70 degrees Celsius kills most of the weed seeds.
In Ethiopia labour is still cheap and hand weeding is usually still the most appropriate way to control
weeds. Various chemicals (herbicides)) can be used to spray weeds and kill them (e.g. glyphosate,
trade name "Roundup") but they are expensive and require exact methods of application. There is
always the possibility of spray drifting onto tree seedlings and causing damage. There is also a risk to
health of workers if safety precautions are not strictly followed.
If application of herbicides is contemplated, then the following considerations must be taken into
account:
 Likelihood of damage to tree seedlings from the herbicide formulation;
 Correct concentrations and dosage rates;
 Timing of herbicide application;
 Prevailing weather conditions; and
 A safe method of application to ensure the workers’ health is not affected.
Despite these limitations for using chemical weed killers, they are useful for control of weeds which
produce rhizomes or underground stems and which are therefore difficult to eliminate by simply
digging the plant out. Where such weeds occur within seedbeds or pot beds, they can be sprayed with
Roundup when the beds are empty. Spot spraying of individual weeds is all that is required. If this is
done, it obviates the need for digging up whole pot beds annually to control weeds. If weeds growing
up from the base of pot beds are a problem, then placing a strong sheet of black plastic under the pots
is also an option. This plastic sheeting has the dual benefit of preventing taproot growth below the
tubes and therefore reduces root-pruning costs.
If it is anticipated that there will be a large number of weeds in the germination or potting mix, it is
advisable to pre -germinate them. This can be achieved by watering pots and seedbeds for several
weeks before sowing. The weeds can then be killed by stopping watering and letting them die from
drought. Alternatively, they can be sprayed with herbicide or removed by hand before sowing when
they can still be relatively easy to remove.
It is best to remove weeds while they are still small because this minimizes their adverse effects on
tree seedlings due to competition, and it is also easier and cheaper to remove wee ds while they are
still small. If weeds are allowed to grow large they develop large roots which are difficult to remove
and also more likely to result in root disturbance of the tree seedlings. The potting mix should be
moist when weeding to enable easier removal of roots. A pointed stick, dibble, flattened piece of wire
or similar tool can help to remove weeds with their roots so that they do not grow again.
If there is crusting of the soil surface in pots, this is a good time to combine cultivation of t he surface
with removal of weeds. Weeding must be done repeatedly - at intervals of about two weeks when
seedlings are small, but at longer intervals as the seedlings become larger, weeds tend to be
suppressed and fewer weeds are germinating. Frequent insp ection by the foreman will indicate when
and where weeding is required, and this can vary widely between nurseries and seasons.
7.1.6 Thinning the stand
Once seedlings are several centimeters tall, there should only be a single seedling per tube to
minimize between-seedling competition. While weeding, it is also a convenient time to thin the tree

50
seedlings if this has not been previously done. Only a single, healthy, centrally placed seedling should
be left in direct-sown pots, which initially often have several seedlings.
7.1.7 Root pruning
A good root system, with a well-developed mass of fine feeder roots, is an essential feature of quality
"target seedlings” we want to grow. It should be emphasized that a good root system of the right size
is the singl e most important factor in determining a good survival rate of the seedling at the
reforestation site.
Root-pruning of tubed seedlings is an essential operation that should be an integral part of good
nursery management. The purpose of root-pruning is to:
 Prevent the development of a taproot system outside the tubes;
 Encourage the growth of a compact, fibrous root system within the tube with many active
rootlets that are able to absorb water and nutrients;
 Maintain a favourable root/shoot ratio (the higher the better); and
 Produce sturdy seedlings that have a thick stem diameter relative to their height.
After germination, many species in nurseries quickly develop a taproot that grows vertically
downwards within the tube. Acacia and other drought -resistant species such as Leucaena are
particularly able to develop a taproot very quickly. If tubed seedlings are not root -pruned, the roots
will extend into the soil below the tubes constituting the base of the pot bed. This extended root
system supports fast d evelopment of a succulent, soft, shoot system. The result of this is that a
substantial portion of the root system will remain in the nursery bed after removing seedlings at
planting time. The roots remaining within the tube are often only a short section of woody taproot that
has few lateral roots. Such un -pruned seedlings have a low root/shoot ratio. The relatively few roots
remaining within the tube are then insufficient to supply this once vigorous seedling with enough
water to prevent wilting, and possibly death, after planting.
Often the problem with unprunned seedlings is not apparent while seedlings are still in the nursery. In
fact, to the casual observer, a tall and "soft" seedling resulting from inadequate root pruning may look
better than a smal ler, quality, seedling that has been consistently root pruned. Regular root -pruning
should prevent the growth of a taproot below the bottom of the tube. It also results in the formation of
a more branched root system, with many small active rootlets within the tube. Whenever a seedling is
root-pruned there is a physiological response by the plant to regenerate new lateral rootlets above the
point where the roots were cut (i.e. within the tube). Root -pruning, therefore, increases the root/shoot
ratio, and in particular the proportion of fine roots compared to woody roots. Root -pruning also helps
to limit height growth of seedlings but encourages diameter growth of the stem, so producing more
sturdy seedlings, which is an important desirable character of target seedlings.
Seedlings should be root-pruned for the first time when the taproot has emerged from the base of the
tube and is no more than 1 mm thick. The time required for the seedling to grow to this point varies
greatly depending on the species, and may be as soon as 6 weeks after germination. The foreman must
periodically lift tubes at random to determine the extent of root growth and then begin root -pruning
accordingly. After the initial root -pruning, another taproot will develop with time, so repeate d root-
pruning is necessary at intervals of 2-4 weeks, depending on species. The final root-pruning should be
made about 2 weeks before the anticipated planting date, which should allow further new rootlets to
regenerate before planting. A thick, strong, t aproot several millimetres in diameter should never be
allowed to develop below the tube.
Repeated root-pruning is a labour -intensive task, and this is one reason why insufficient pruning is
done in many nurseries. As mentioned previously, the correct sow ing date is critical to minimize the
number of root-pruning that will be needed. Sowing too early will, of course, increase the number of
root-pruning required.

51
Root-pruning, if done at the correct stage of seedling growth, often results in subsequent slight wilting
of the seedlings. Hence, in order to avoid this problem, it should be done on cloudy days or late in the
afternoon. It is also best if the potting mix is moist at the time of pruning but not so moist that soil loss
from tubes occurs when liftin g the seedlings. After pruning, the seedlings should be thoroughly
watered to help them recover after the shock of losing part of the root system. If for some reason root-
pruning has been unduly delayed, there might be severe wilting and it may be necessar y to shade the
seedlings to help them recover.
7.1.7 Hardening-off
In a well -managed nursery, seedlings grow under favourable conditions and with continuous care.
They are sheltered from excess sun and dry season winds, they are regularly watered, and the y are
even fertilized according to their needs. By contrast, the plants are often subjected to extremely
difficult conditions when they are planted out. The most likely situation is that seedlings will
experience severe moisture stress and increased heat stress after planting. This can be caused by a lack
of rainfall after planting, as well as increased wind, sunshine and lower relative humidity in
plantations. Management of the seedlings in the nursery must be designed to accustom them to, and
be able to t olerate, these difficult conditions before they are planted. This is done by the process
known as "hardening-off". Hardening-off is the process of gradually increasing the moisture and heat
stress to which seedlings are subjected. The aim is eventually to create in the artificially controlled
environment of the nursery conditions similar to those that will be experienced by the seedlings in the
natural environment of the plantation.
Hardening-off should start at least four weeks before planting is anticipa ted, which in most of
Ethiopia starts in July. Therefore, hardening-off should start in early June at the latest, and if possible
in mid -May. After starting hardening there should not be any significant increase in height of
seedlings, but their diameter should continue to increase. At the completion of hardening the seedlings
should have well-lignified tissues; the leaves should have a thick cuticle and be hard and leathery; the
stem should be brown, not green, and as thick as possible; and there should be a much-branched fine
root system within the tube with no evidence of recent taproot growth below the tube. The essential
actions needed to induce hardening-off in seedlings are described below.
Removal of shade
In previous sections it has been suggested that shading should only be required during germination
and after pricking -out. The majority of the seedlings' life in the nursery should therefore be under
conditions of full sunshine. If for any reason, however, seedlings are still shaded when planting t ime
is approaching, urgent action must be taken to reduce the shading in gradual steps. This gradual
removal of shade is critical because if seedlings go from 90% shade to sudden full sunshine there is
insufficient time for them to adapt to the sudden seve re conditions, resulting in appreciable mortality.
For at least the last month in the nursery seedlings must be exposed to full sunshine, even in the
lowlands.
Root-pruning
Even if there has been little root-pruning in the early stages of the seedlings' growth, it is essential that
root-pruning is carried out during the weeks of hardening -off. If a taproot grows below the tube, a
seedling continues rapid growth and produces "soft" shoots, which make it impossible to adequately
harden-off. Thus, final root-pruning should be made about two weeks before planting is anticipated.
Reduction of watering
The watering frequency must be gradually reduced so that physiological changes can occur in the
seedlings in response to the imposed water stress. After watering, the foreman must observe the
seedlings closely for the first signs of wilting before watering again. This cycle of watering and then
waiting until seedlings start to wilt is repeated, waiting a little longer before re -watering with each
successive cycle. It is important to not wait too long before watering again as seedling death may
occur if wilting is allowed to continue for too long. This requirement to apply sufficient moisture
stress to induce hardening without also causing significant mortality is a delicate balance, and requires
good judgment from an experienced foreman. In this manner, seedlings gradually develop appropriate

52
morphological and physiological characteristics and become accustomed to water stress. The
development of a thicker leaf cutic le, which reduces water loss from wilted leaves, is one very
important consequence of hardening-off.
7.2 Protection: pests and diseases
A nursery place is a place which can be a source for numerous categories of destructive agents. Seed,
germinating seed, and seedlings (up to the time of dispatch) might be used as a food source by many
biological agents. In the process of using the seedlings for food, considerable damage can be inflicted.
Loss in vigour and mortality of seedlings are possible. There is als o distinct possibility that some
harmful agents such as fungi and insects can be dispersed with the nursery seedlings to new locations.
This is a major reason why many countries now have a policy of producing pest - and pathogen-free
seedlings so that undesirable biological agents are not dispersed along with the seedling.
The major categories of biological agents which might damage seedlings in nurseries are the
following:
 Insects,
 Pathogens: These are microscopic organisms that include fungi, bacteria, vi ruses and
nematodes, and
 Animals: These include mice, rats and squirrels.
There might also be damage from birds, snails and slugs but these appear to be of very minor
importance. Large domestic and farm animals can, of course, devastate a nursery but adequate fencing
should exclude them.
7.2.1 Insects
There are many insects that are potential pests in nurseries, but relatively few appear to be of
economic importance to seedling production. In the majority of nurseries insects are a nuisance but
they do not regularly cause major plant losses. The nursery foreman should, however, be constantly
vigilant to detect any pest/disease problem at an early stage so that preparations can be made for
control if this should become necessary. There are several insects, w hich may at times become a
significant problem in some nurseries, and these are considered below.
Grasshoppers and crickets
These insects are common in low numbers in many nurseries and do cause some damage by chewing
leaves and shoots, especially of tend er young seedlings. Grasshoppers vary in size from 1 cm to over
8 cm and the damage they cause individually varies accordingly. The presence of grasshoppers is
encouraged by other vegetation which provides shelter and food.
The presence of dead vegetation , especially branches and long grass, can also provide a suitable
habitat for grasshoppers. The dense grass shades typical in nurseries also encourage grasshopper
attack on the seedlings being shaded. Simple measures to limit grasshopper damage should, the refore,
include keeping the area around pot beds clean and minimizing shading of seedlings. If insect
numbers and damage are high, it may be necessary to spray with an insecticide such as Fenitrothion.
Crickets can be a nuisance in some instances. These in sects tend to hide between and below the tubes
during the day and come out to feed at night. If insecticide needs to be used for severe infestations,
Fenitrothion applied late in the afternoon should be effective.
Cutworms and other caterpillars
Cutworms are the larvae of a moth (Agrotis) which lays its eggs on the stem or soil surface and when
the small caterpillars (larvae) hatch from the eggs they initially feed and live on the leaves, which may
become skeletonized. As the caterpillars become older they spend the day in the soil and only emerge
at night to feed. They then frequently cut the stem of small seedlings slightly above soil level, thus
giving them their name " cutworm". These insects are frequent in many nurseries and show a distinct
preference for eucalyptus. The larvae can be found by careful examination of the soil beneath

53
seedlings which have been cut. The larvae are hairless, grey or brown, 1 -2 cm long, and curl up
immediately when touched.
If control is required this can be done with an in secticide such as Dursban or Trichlorophon when the
larvae are still small and have not reached the stage of entering the soil during the day. After the
larvae grow larger and enter the soil they are less easily controlled by a contact insecticide and,
therefore, a systemic insecticide such as Rogor should be used. All caterpillars are the larvae of
various moths and butterflies, and many of these different species of caterpillar may occasionally
cause damage in nurseries. Control can be achieved by picking the caterpillars off by hand, but if the
infestation is severe, spraying with a contact insecticide such as Fenitrothion may be required.
Termites and ants
Both these insects form colonies with a single queen and numerous workers. Termites (also known as
white ants) can cause severe damage to saplings and larger trees by attacking the woody roots. They
may be present in nurseries but do not appear to attack seedlings, probably because the roots of
seedlings are not sufficiently woody to provide suitable f ood for them. If grass is used to cover
germinating seed, termites sometimes consume part of the grass and build tunnels into the grass
covering. This can result in disturbance of seed, which will be reflected in poorer germination. In
some instances the t ermites build such extensive tunnels within pots that subsequent soil collapse
follows, exposing roots of seedlings.
Ants are not usually a problem, but instances have occurred where they collect small seeds after
sowing. Such ants are known as harvester ants. Ants may also increase the spread of insects such as
scales and mealy bugs to adjacent seedlings within the nursery. The most efficient way to control
termites and ants is to locate the nest of the colony and destroy it, including the queen. Insectic ide
such as Dursban can be applied to the soil forming the base of pot beds if it is not possible to locate
the colony and destroy it. A termiticide called Marshall SusCon is very effective and has relatively
low toxicity to humans.
Pesticides such as DDT , Dieldrin, Chlordane and Aldrin (known collectively as chlorinated
hydrocarbon compounds) are very effective against termites but they are also very toxic to humans
and animals and they are very persistent in the environment. Their use is, therefore, not
recommended. Relatively high concentrations of pesticide can be used when spraying soil because
there is no problem with phytotoxicity if the spraying is done before tubes are placed in the pot beds.
7.2.2 Pathogens
Pathogens include microscopic organisms such as fungi, bacteria, viruses, nematodes and
mycoplasmas. These organisms are too small to be seen with the naked eye and must be viewed with
a microscope if they are to be studied and identified. In forest nurseries worldwide by far the most
important group of pathogens are the fungi. Fungi comprise many different genera and there are
thousands of different species that can cause disease of plants. Fungi are plants that lack chlorophyll
so they must obtain their food from dead organic matter (saprophyt es) or living plants (pathogens).
Most fungi are composed of fine threads (hyphae) that grow within soil and also within and over the
surface of plants in the case of pathogens. Fungi reproduce by means of tiny spores which can be
disseminated with air, water, seed, compost or soil depending on the species of fungus involved.
For a disease to develop in plants three basic requirements must be fulfilled:
1) The plant must be susceptible to infection;
2) A pathogen must be present; and
3) The environment must be favourable for infection and colonization of the host plant by the
pathogen.
Disease only develops if all three of these conditions are fulfilled. If even one of the conditions is
unfulfilled there will be no disease. In practice it is usual to find that the above prerequisites for
disease are partially fulfilled, leading to varying degrees of disease severity. For example, a plant
might be slightly susceptible, the population of pathogens is low, and the environment is only

54
marginally conducive to infection; this would result in such a low level of disease that it might not
even be noticed in a nursery. By contrast, a highly susceptible host plant, high pathogen population
and favourable environment for infection could result in epidemic losses. In practice, a ll gradations
between negligible and severe disease are likely to occur at different times in different species and
locations.
In general, fungal diseases are favoured by moist and warm conditions such as are typical in high -
rainfall tropical areas. This applies especially to diseases of leaves and stems. It is usual to have
relatively little plant disease in dry climates for most of the year. In the artificial environment of a
nursery there is a high density of genetically similar, closely spaced plants, and watering and shading
can create an environment which is relatively favourable for disease. Also, in a nursery that has
existed for some years, there is likely to be a build -up of pathogen populations with time so that
disease problems also increase.
Disease can occur in any part of a plant, including germinating seed, roots, leaves, stems, flowers and
fruit. One system of disease classification is based on the plant organs affected and the type of
symptoms that are evident. Thus, we have diseases such as "root rot" or "leaf spot", each of which can
be caused by numerous different pathogens. Another system of disease classification is based on the
identity of the pathogen; this requires expert knowledge and laboratory facilities.
Damping-off
Damping-off is the single most important disease in nurseries. Foremen should become familiar with
the symptoms of damping -off and its control. Currently, it is usual for foremen to blame "frost" or
poor-quality seed for problems, which are in fact due to fungi. Dampi ng-off is a disease of
germinating seed and young seedlings, and is normally most prevalent during the first two or three
weeks after germination. It is usual to distinguish two types of damping-off disease:
Pre-emergence damping-off:In this disease the se ed either rots before it germinates or the pathogen
kills the root and shoot (hypocotyl) once it has emerged from the seed but before it has broken
through the soil surface. This disease often goes undetected and it is very easy to be misled and
wrongly conclude that the seed is not viable. Pre-emergence damping-off can be especially common if
seed is sown too deep in cold, wet soil that is poorly aerated.
Post-emergence damping-off: Post-emergence damping-off is characterized by infection and rotting
of the stem of young seedlings close to ground level. Typically there is discoloration and reduction in
the diameter of the stem at the infection site, which is best observed by gently removing the seedlings
root from the soil by carefully washing with water. The discoloration (usually brownish and
contrasting with the white colour of healthy stems) and diameter shrinkage are due to cell death
following invasion by fungal hyphae. This type of infection often causes the small seedlings to fall
over because there is little strength left in the rotted stem section, insufficient even to support a tiny
shoot that may only have two cotyledons.
Damping-off can affect most species of plant, but small -seeded species, which initially have very
delicate stems, are most li kely to become affected. Eucalyptus and Cupressus are often severely
affected. Moderate and severe losses occur in nurseries as a result of damping -off. Damping-off can
be caused by any of over 30 different fungi, but the three genera Rhizoctonia, Pythium and
Phytophthora are of particular importance. The most likely source of the damping-off fungi is the soil
that is used to prepare the germination mix. However, they can also originate from the irrigation
water, compost, seed, dust, soil splash, and some are able to cause infection from airborne spores.
In highland nurseries there is also frequent damping -off caused by a fungus known as grey mould
[Botrytis cineria). If this pathogen is causing the problem, the infection point on the stem is often
slightly above ground level and results in moist lesions (infected areas of plant tissue) which quickly
develop a mass of grayish spores. These spores are easily dispersed in even the slightest air currents
and this can very rapidly lead to widespread infection of other seedlings.

55
A feature of damping-off disease is that it tends to occur in spreading patches. This is because from an
initial infection the fungal hyphae are able to spread out and infect adjacent seedlings without having
to first produce spores. The rate of spread of such patches can be very rapid so that in a few days
extensive mortality can occur in seed trays and seedbeds. If seed is sown directly in tubes, this tends
to restrict most damping-off from spreading beyond individual tubes and this is a distinct advantage of
direct sowing. There is, however, an exception to this limited spreading between tubes if the damping-
off is caused by Botrytis (and to a lesser extent by Fusarium and other fungi with airborne or splash -
dispersed spores). This is b ecause Botrytis rapidly produces large numbers of airborne spores which
can easily pass over the polythene tubing, which is an effective barrier to hyphal growth.
In the simplest terms, damping -off is a disease that is particularly likely in wet, humid, s haded
environments. In general, the following cultural and environmental factors tend to increase the
severity of damping-off:
 Sowing seed too deeply:- Sowing depth should be no more than 2 -3 times the diameter of the
seed;
 Sowing seed too densely:- This tends to create crowded growing conditions, which favour the
creation of a humid microclimate around seedlings, which in turn favours infection;
 Direct contact and hyphal growth:- Also, crowded seedlings make it easy for the pathogen to
spread rapidly to adjacent plants by direct contact and hyphal growth;
 Poor sterilization:- Using a germination mix that has not been sterilized or pasteurized;
 Poor soil mix:- A germination mix that is of heavy texture (i.e. containing too much clay and
silt and not enough sand) which results in poor aeration and slow drainage of excess water;
 Excessive watering resulting in prolonged wetness:- The potting mix should always be moist,
but not excessively wet, during germination;
 Poor ventilation around seedlings :- resulting in high air humidity and continued wetness of
the soil surface and root collar;
 Excessive shading: - tends to maintain wet conditions and high humidity. Lack of sunshine
also makes the plant physiologically weak and so more susceptible to infection. Lack of light
also lengthens the period in which seedlings are in the soft, succulent, growth stage during
which they are most susceptible to damping-off;
 Alkaline soil (pH over 7);
 High nitrogen content in germination mix; Manure that is not well decomposed; and too much
compost in the germination mix;
 Too many weeds:- help to maintain a humid microclimate; and
 High salinity in the germination mix or irrigation water.
Control of damping -off: The above conditions favouring development of damping -off should be
minimized in every nursery. The specific changes that can economically be made will depend on the
circumstances prevailing at each nursery. A major improvement in control of damping -off is usual if
it is possible to sterilize or pasteurize soil. The use of solarisation to heat soil is relatively simple and
is recommended especially if seed trays are used for germination. Care must be taken to prevent re -
infestation of treated soil with pathogens, which can easily occur if strict hygiene is not practiced.
In most nurseries it should be relatively easy to ensure that the following simple measures are taken to
minimize damping-off:
 Use well-drained germination mix of light texture (i.e. with a high proportion of sand);
 Sowing density should give a spacing of 1-2 cm between seedlings;
 Watering frequency should be carefully controlled to avoid excess wetness; and
 Shading should be reduced as soon as possible.
The following practices can further help to reduce damping-off disease:
 After sowing seeds, cover them wit h fine sand. Sand contains few pathogens and helps to
maintain good drainage and aeration. It also enables rapid emergence of the hypocotyls
(shoot), and thereby reduces the time available for development of pre-emergent damping-off;

56
 If watering is done la te in the afternoon, high air humidity and a wet soil surface might
prevail throughout the night and favour damping -off. Watering should be done in the
mornings and early enough in the afternoon to allow drainage and evaporation of excess
water before the onset of evening;
 The seed -bed germination mix should be replaced periodically to prevent build -up of
pathogen populations in successive years. Careful observation of the incidence of damping -
off in the previous year will indicate when replacement is required; and
 During pricking-out, seedlings should be held by a leaf and not the stem. The stem is very
delicate and if slightly damaged through touching with the fingers is more liable to infection
from damping-off fungi.
If adequate control of damping -off i s not achieved by implementing cultural methods as suggested
above, it might be necessary to use chemical fungicides. Fungicides are expensive and need to be used
with care to prevent health hazards to workers. It is, therefore, not recommended to rely on fungicides
for control of damping-off but rather to concentrate on improving cultural methods. Damping -off can
develop very quickly and high losses can occur within a few days. As a last resort, spraying with a
fungicide should help to slow down the develo pment of damping-off. However, once disease is well
established in a favourable environment, even repeated spraying may not effectively control it. The
most suitable fungicide to use depends on knowing the species of fungus involved. Fungicides such as
Captan, Dexon, PCNB, Dithane M -45, or Benlate could be used on a trial basis to see if they control
the disease. With time, each nursery should accumulate information about which fungicides are
effective in its specific circumstances. If experience from previous years indicates persistent damping-
off, treating the seed with fungicide before sowing should be considered. A suitable fungicide for seed
dressing is Thiram.
It is also possible to apply a fungicide drench to the soil before sowing. Prophylactic spra ying with
fungicides before damping-off develops is possible but should only be considered for valuable seed or
where all other attempts at control have failed.
7.2.3 Higher animals
Besides straying domestic stock such as goats, sheep, donkeys and cattle, which may enter nurseries if
fencing used is inadequate. Rats, mice and squirrels are a problem in some nurseries. Rats, mice and
squirrels (all rodents) might eat stored seed if it is not placed in vermin-proof containers such as metal
tins. Seed stored in plastic bags or plastic jars can be eaten because the rodents have sharp teeth that
allow them to gnaw through soft materials. Alternatively, the store itself can be made rodent proof.
Those nurseries which provide a suitable habitat for rodents close to seedling beds are most likely to
suffer significant damage. Such habitats include, particularly, stone walls close to seedbeds and pot
beds, as well as long grass and heaps of rubbish. Reductions in rodent populations can be achieved by
keeping grass sh ort, removing rubbish to heaps some distance from the seedling areas (and
composting all organic materials), and not building stone walls close to seedling -production areas.
Food scraps should not be left lying around to discourage rodents.
More direct co ntrol methods can include the setting of traps and laying of poison baits such as
coumarine or warfarin. The baits must be sheltered to protect them from rain. Rodent poisons are
toxic to humans as well as domestic animals, so precautions are required to l imit access only to
rodents. A cat can be useful to help in control of rats and mice. A covering of wire mesh supported on
a suitable frame should prevent rodent damage, but this is an expensive solution and would only be
feasible for protecting small numb ers of valuable seedlings. Birds are not usually important in
damaging seed or seedlings. Indeed, birds are frequently seen feeding on insects on seedling foliage
and, therefore, they have a beneficial effect and should be encouraged.

57
MODULE 8: SEEDLING TRANSPORTATION AND
HANDLING
8.1 Grading, packing and transportation
8.1.1 Grading
In any nursery there are always some poor -quality seedlings which would have a low chance of
survival if planted out. Such seedlings should not be planted at all as this is a waste of money and will
incur the further cost of replacement planting (beating -up). The process of separating poor -quality
seedlings from those of reasonable and high quality is known as "grading" or "culling". It is usual to
expect 10-20% of the seedlings produced to fall short of minimum quality standards and these should
be culled. The reasons for poor quality include both genetic and nursery-management factors.
In many nurseries there is often very little culling, and in many instances virtually all l iving seedlings
are dispatched for planting. This is a major reason for the frequent poor survival in plantations. The
solution is to plan excess production sufficient to allow for a culling of 20% of seedlings. If pits have
been dug, there is a strong temptation to plant them even if only inferior seedlings are available.
The best-quality seedlings should be used on the most difficult sites, areas with difficult access, and
areas which are of particular importance. Seedlings of slightly poorer quality can be planted on more
favourable or less important sites. If supplementary watering after planting is possible (e.g. private
plantings around homes, schools, churches), then you may still use lower-quality seedlings and obtain
good survival.
In order to be pr acticable, the culling must be based on shoot characteristics that can be very rapidly
assessed by the relatively untrained labour force working in nurseries. From experience in many
countries, seedling height, collar diameter and general appearance of seedlings have been found useful
criteria on which to base culling.
Seedling height
The seedling should be about twice the height of the tube. The tubes in the majority of nurseries are
15-cm long, so the seedlings should be about 30 -cm tall. Excessively tall (over 40 cm) and short (less
than 15 cm) seedlings should be culled.
Collar diameter
The collar diameter (stem diameter at soil level) should be as large as possible; and the thin, etiolated
plants should be discarded. The collar diameter should be at lea st 2 mm, and with good nursery
management it should be possible to adopt 3 mm as the minimum acceptable standard.
General appearance
Seedlings should have a balanced and symmetrical growth of normal healthy green leaves without
yellowing or other discolora tion. There should be no evidence of insect pests, disease, or obvious
mechanical damage.
Single seedling per tube
At an early stage in growth seedlings should have been reduced to one per tube. If, for whatever
reason, this has not been done, then such tubes should be thinned to one seedling at this stage. This, of
course, assumes that the tube contains one seedling which meets the above three culling criteria.
8.2 Packing and transporting seedlings for planting out
Preparing seedlings for planting requires packing, which if not done carefully can result in appreciable
deterioration of seedling quality, with consequent reduction in survival. The other principal reasons
for poor survival rate are that seedlings are mishandled during transport, loading and u nloading
operations. One must not expect a high survival rate from seedlings that are broken or damaged
mechanically. In many places seedlings have been treated like any other commodity especially while
being transported and unloaded by dump trucks. Maximum care must be taken for the seedlings when
they are transported from nursery to planting sites. The best quality seedlings could be damaged if
they are handled carelessly.

58
On the other hand it is also common to transport seedlings on donkey back or carried by people. Since
people cannot afford carrying many seedlings with pots; because of the weight of the soil, they
remove the plastic pots with the soil in order to carry as many seedlings as they can. This can
tremendously affect the survival rate of seed lings. Therefore, proper care must be taken during
transporting the seedlings as safe as possible to the planting site. To achieve acceptable results the
following should be done:
 Only send those seedlings to the field which have passed the grading standards; and
 Water the seedlings thoroughly the day before lifting the tubes.
Ensure that the whole depth of the tube has been moistened by lifting random seedlings and
examining them to ensure that the wetting front has passed all the way to the bottom of the tube. This
usually requires repeated watering with a little time difference between each to allow infiltration. For
instance, for dry 20 -cm long tubes it will require 3 -4 successive watering to wet the whole tube.
Moisture stored within the tube is a majo r reason why tubed seedlings have an advantage over open -
rooted seedlings and this advantage is largely lost if tubes are not thoroughly watered before dispatch.
This moisture reserve will help the seedling to better tolerate dry periods if there should be several
days without rain following planting. The following critical issues must be considered during lifting
and transport:
 When lifting seedlings they should always be handled by holding the tube and not by pulling
on the stem as this can easily damage the shoot, and also lead to subsequent pathogenic
infections.
 Transport seedlings in a vertical position by placing them closely stacked in boxes. This
minimizes shoot damage and soil loss from both the bottom and top of open-ended tubes.
 Placing trays fu ll of seedlings horizontally into trucks can result in significant soil loss from
tubes, often exposing roots to air drying, as well as mechanical damage to shoots. Metal
platforms on vehicles can become very hot and kill roots that come into contact with them.
Pouring water over the platform or spreading a layer of straw, grass, soil or similar material
on it helps to reduce this problem.
 If there are sufficient numbers of boxes, they are loaded onto trucks with minimal further loss
of soil during transpor tation and unloading. To increase the carrying capacity of trucks,
shelving is required so that several layers of boxes can be accommodated, one above the
other, and so make transportation more economical.
 The seedlings should be covered so that they are n ot exposed to sun and wind during the trip
from nursery to plantation. There should be some space between the seedlings and the cover
to minimize mechanical damage. Covering is especially important if the distance from
nursery to plantation is appreciable as desiccation of seedlings depends largely on the length
of time they are exposed. If covers are not available, the effects of desiccation can be reduced
by transporting on rainy or cloudy days.
 Potted plants can be transported safe if they are stacked on the floor of trucks or other
vehicles in an upright position. This consumes a lot of space and requires quite frequent travel
to and from the planting site. Instead, the seedlings can be laid one on top of the other, the
shoots of two rows facing each oth er. In this manner the seedlings can be transported when
the distance is reasonably short but should be unloaded and stacked in an upright position and
the planting needs to start soon.
 Bare-rooted seedlings can be laid down on wet banana or false banana (enset) leaves, sacks or
other materials with the roots puddle with soil and water. The bundles of seedlings can be
stacked upright on the vehicle floor. In this way, quite a large number of seedlings can be
transported at a time. Where the planting site i s far away and vehicles are not available, the
bundles can be transported by donkeys, horses or mules.
 Normally, plants arrive one day ahead of planting. Where shade and watering facilities are
available, planting stock can be brought in several days befo re planting is to take place. As

59
soon as the plants arrive at the planting site, they must be watered and stored in cool, moist
and shaded place until they are planted.
 Only dispatch the number of seedlings from the nursery that can be planted in one day.
 The seedlings should be planted as soon as possible, preferably within hours of arriving at the
plantation site. After carefully unloading the seedlings, they should be placed in a shaded,
sheltered, position which is the coolest available. If there is an y delay in planting, it is
essential that the moisture content of tubes be constantly monitored, and if they become dry
supplementary watering is carried out. If seedlings are planted with low tube-moisture content
this will have a detrimental effect on su rvival if good rains do not immediately follow
planting. It is common in Ethiopia to observe several days of dry weather after planting. Thus,
it is essential that each seedling has adequate water stored in the potting mix at planting time.
The general lac k of boxes is a significant problem for efficient transport of seedlings. Firstly, it
necessitates repeated handling of seedlings, which is not only labour intensive but increases the
probability of additional soil loss from tubes with each handling. To re duce this soil loss from tubes,
nursery managers tend to transport seedlings that are not adequately watered because relatively dry
soil is less likely to be lost from tubes. Thus the lack of boxes is indirectly responsible not only for
loss of soil but also for planting seedlings with a relatively dry potting mix. The situation can only be
improved if money is made avail able for purchase of sufficient numbers of suitable boxes.

MODULE 9: SUPPORTING NURSERIES TO PRODUCE
PLANNED TARGETS
The type of suppor t needed for all type of nurseries is in be related production , technology, inputs,
credit, infrastructure and marketing. The support can be classified under soft and hard. Soft support s
are relates to information, training and advice while hard support on the other hand relates to inputs
such as tree seed, wate, tools and fencing.
9.1 Supporting central nurseries to produce planned targets
9.1.1 Training
A good nursery operation relies on continuity of staffs that are professional, careful and honest.
Although the casuals or technical workers do most of the work described here, everyone in the
nursery ought to have as much knowledge about nursery management and operations. Understanding
even in a simplified way the processes in a germinating seed, a rooti ng cutting or a growing seedling,
and the importance of high humidity, watering, shading, etc. will help prevent many errors in daily
work. Only when all workers feel that they are part of the nursery operation, when they understand the
part they play and when they feel proud of it, can work efficiently and productively.
Staff training can take the form of scheduled courses or of regular (weekly, monthly) staff meetings
covering a particular topic. This can be reinforced by repeating explanations of techni ques during
work.
9.1.2 Introduction of new technologies
A mixture of new, adopted and indigenous technologies should be employed in central nurseries.
Central nurseries should h ave regular and ea sy access to new and appropriate technologies. Experts
and A dvisors at Federal, Regional and Zonal level should play a leading role in introducing new
technologies to central nurseries.
9.2. Backing self-help group nurseries in production and marketing
There is ample experience from SLM in which self -help group n urseries are successfully
producing and delivering quality seedlings to a project. It only requires good training, provision of
essential equipment and supervision of the production system.
This arrangement has benefits of enabling the woredas to adequately provide planting materials.
Besides, farmers will develop skills and knowledge about managing seedlings and generate income.
9.2.1 Training
Training should be provided to group members focusing on technical skills required of nursery
work as well as basi c business and management skills. Farm er -to farmer training and exchange
visit is a powerful tool to create awareness and enhance capacity.
9.2.2 Equipment and nursery space
Kebele administration is expected to offer a nursery space to self -help groups (minimum 0.5 ha).
The land should have access to perennial water supply.  Besides, the following material support
should be provided by the woreda office of agriculture to user groups engaged on multiplication of
planting materials: whee l barrow, watering ca n, spade, r ake, root pruning scissors, seedling tray,
pickaxe, and sand sieve, Polythene tube, watering canes, bucket and rakes. Table 12 below shows,
the list of equipment’s required for establishing a group nursery with production capacity of
50,000 seedlings.

F Seedling purchase cost No 50,000 0.5 25,000
Total 31,630
9.2.3 Provision of initial stocks of grasses and seeds
At the time of establishment, the woreda office of agriculture in collab oration with  SLM
coordination,  should facilitate the support on the provision of  different species of seed (up to 6
kg) and different species of  initial grass stocks  (500 -1000 clumps). Once group nurseries are
established, they will be responsible for fulfilling their seed and grass stock demand.
9.2.4 Bylaw development and legalization
Regional and Zonal experts/Advisors and Woreda TC members are expected to assist self-help groups
to develop bylaw and get registered as Small and Medium scale enterpri se. Although small and
medium enterprises are not promoted in SLMP, the establishment of group nurseries is suitable for
this type of organization. Small enterprises have a capital of 50,000 – 500,000 ETB and between 6 to
30 workers.  Due to Cooperatives Promotion Agency’s:
 long processing of the legalization
 Weak follow-up and professional backstopping due to excessive workload,
 Very limited practice-oriented training and focusing on theory
 Cumbersome and tedious bye -law document and use of so many led gers at a time in
which the documentation is also poor
In contrary, medium and small enterprises Promotion Agency more preferred due to:
 Fast processing of the legalization and immediate certification
 Relatively better follow-up
 More of practice-oriented than focusing on theories
 Use of customized, short and easily understandable bye-law formulation
 Focusing on a number of small groups that will be amalgamated in the future than
aiming on one or two non-manageable groups.
Hence, the use of this mandated and more effective agency would seem more preferable.
9.2.5. Agreements between Woreda and self-help group nurseries
The purchase of planting materials from self-help groups is one option of fulfilling demand. Efforts
should be made to encourage user group s to produce planting materials for the market in large
quantities. Woreda office of agriculture can make contracts with user groups who have space and
capacity for multiplication of various planting materials.  The contract fixes the types of plant material
to be provided, time of delivery, delivery place and the guaranteed price for specified quality
standards.

62
A model agreement currently being used in SLM - Oromia is attached (Annex 7). The following
essential elements are include in the agreement:
 The agreement is  renewed per every planting season,
 The agreement has legal binding articles that would enable to plant standardized seedlings in
time,
 Woreda-level professionals are  obliged to give intensive support to producers for quality
production,
 At start-up 20% of the total amount, upon finishing 50% of the work 30%, and finally, upon
completion and delivery of the product the remaining 50% would be paid.
9.3 Backing individual nurseries in production and marketing
Individual nurseries largely depend on family resources. However, Government/projects may provide
technical and material assistance to operators, particularly during nursery establishment. This
assistance usually focuses on providing good quality seed, training on basics of seedling production
and nursery management and assistance on equipment’s such as water cans, hoes, spades and rakes.
Commercial-oriented individual nurseries evolve as self -funded through seedling sales and the
provision of technical services. Closely follow up and supervision is also provided.
9.3.1 Training
A training programme may not be designed separately for private nursery owners; we mostly
include them in the list of trainees at the time we program for any other training. Leading farmers
who established the ir own private nurseries are usually invited in the regular Training and Visit
Program (Farmer-to-farmer Experience Exchange Visit).
Training support for private nursery owners should focus on technical aspects and entrepreneurial
skill, namely: seed col lection, seed purchase, germination, and seedling husbandry.  Besides, it is
necessary to equip them with entrepreneurial skill (Business planning, bookkeeping, contract
negotiation, development of business plan, market assessment and etc.).
9.3.2 Equipment
Water can, hoes, spades and rakes would be bestowed on the basis of leading farmers’ surpassed
performance.  It is advisable to give them on farmers’ days.  Or, in case, if scarcity of such hand tools
prevails, they must be kept in FTCs to use them turn by turn.
9.3.3 Provision of initial stocks of grasses and seeds
The office of agriculture of the woreda in collaboration with SLMP, should provide initial stocks of
grasses (up to 50 clumps) and starter seeds of different species (1 -2 kg), and distribute them to
contracting farmers. If the species to be produced are indigenous ones, it could be up to the individual
farmer or the group to collect healthy seeds in their vicinity. The quality of the seeds collected can be
checked by woreda experts.
9.3.4 Agreements between Woreda and individual nurseries
As done for Self-help group, a contractual agreement can also be entered with private producers
which can be handled in the following ways:
 Contract agreement  where payments are paid by phase by phase (when site clearance
and sowing of seeds is completed, the second payment where seedlings have well
germinated, and finally when the agreed number of quality seedlings is delivered)
 The second arrangement can be done where payments are effected when agreed
number of quality seedlings is delivered

MODULE 10: HOW TO MANAGE A NURSERY
After a nursery is established, there are many management considerations relevant to the effective and
economical production of quality seedlings Nursery management can be viewed as the day -today
activities which are performed within an annual time frame to produce maximal numbers of quality
seedlings in the most economical manner. To effectively manage a nursery, the nursery manager must
have a clear idea of on the most important elements of nursery management. These are mainly,
planning of activities, record keeping, regular inventories and quality control.
10.1 Planning activities
Careful planning, organization, implementation and control are required to avoid mismana gement
with resulting poor quality of planting stock. In order to simplify activities, a plan of activities,
covering at least one productive season in the nursery should be made. This will help to plan and
implement activities that require more labour or special equipment. Some labour intensive activities
like sowing, transplanting, root -pruning and lifting must be done in a limited time, and these periods
are usually of critical importance. Other labour intensive activities like pot filling, weeding and
shading must be carried out more or less continuously during the production season. These continuous
seven-days-a-week activities should be well supervised as they are essential if quality target seedlings
are to be produced.
Nursery management can be simp lified if a detailed plan is prepared before the start of the nursery
season. The nursery management plan includes all important nursery activities.  It should cover one
full cycle of the nursery year, starting with an empty nursery at the end of the main rains and
extending until the next rains when the seedlings are transported to the planting site.
Following the nursery management plan it is possible to smoothly implement those nursery activities
that require most labour or special equipment. Certain l abour - work such as transplanting and lifting
must be done during a limited period of time, and these phases are usually critical; success of the
whole planting year depends upon them. Another type of labour -intensive activities is the phase
during which pots are filled.  This activity can be done over a longer period, and should be planned to
start well in advance to avoid bottlenecks (the soil coming late, a shortage in the plastic tube supply,
etc).
Some activities, like the watering of the seedbeds, m ust be done continuously, regularly and over a
certain period of time. For such work, the management plan must reserve a reliable team of permanent
or semi -permanent nursery workers who can be employed seven days a week for the period in
question. The annual nursery management plan is based on the following factors: number and type of
seedlings to be raised, applicable work norms andtiming of activities.
The number and type of seedlings to be raised is decided when the nursery was set up.  However, the
annual amount of seedlings, species by species, is decided every year. Juniperus procera, for example
– needs a full year in the nursery before reaching transplanting stage. Nursery work norms, together
with the seedling production level, help to establish the need for casual labour.  The applicable work
standards are based on experience from the nursery itself, or from similar nurseries elsewhere in the
country.
In calculating the need for casual labour a provision must be made for weekends as well as for official
and church holidays. The people who live in the Ethiopian highland can be counted to work only for
20 to 25 days per month. Therefore, an average need for 600 man -days for sowing would translate
into a requirement of 30 people for a sowing period of one month (20 working days).

64
10.2 Recording in nursery operations
Records are important elements in nursery operations. They are critical especially for newly appointed
staff member who likes to learn about the local nursery management and practices. In contrast,
inadequate record keeping can result in loss of valuable information, information which could
improve methods of production. Nursery records can be conveniently divided into three categories as:
seedling production, costs, and daily diary.
In th e interest of standardization, and to ensure that all relevant information is recorded, nursery
registers should be produced and used by anyone running or starting a nursery. The register provides
an adequate annual record of production procedures and, wit h time, a history of each particular bed.
This means that each bed in the nursery, whether it is a seedbed or a pot bed, must be allocated a
particular number which it retains permanently thereafter. There should be a label indicating the
unique number of each and every seedbed and pot bed in the nursery.
The nursery register is d ivided into five major sections: Seed source , Sowing, Pricking-out (or
transplanting), General remarks, and Dispatch location.
Seed source
This section deals with details of seed -collection and should include a unique batch number which is
applicable to only one specific collection. From this batch number alone it should always be possible
to retrieve the other collection details. If local seed collections are made, then a local s eed register
should also be started, and particulars of each collection recorded . If seed is received from external
sources, it should already have its own unique batch number. However, if for some reason it does not,
it should immediately be given a numbe r from the local register, and all relevant collection details
recorded.
Sowing
This section deals with recording basic information about sowing and should include dates, rates, pre -
sowing treatment, date germination started, date germination was completed , actual germination rate
(percent) and actual number of germinant. This section provides valuable information of particular
use in organizing future sowings, and is well worth the little extra effort required to acquire it. The
total labour expended on sowing should be recorded in man-days.
Pricking-out
This section is to record the essential details of pricking-out, including dates when the work was done,
the seedbed number of the transplanted seedlings, size of pots used, and potting mix used. The
survival rate of the seedlings should be recorded when no further mortality is likely to occur. The total
labour expended on pricking-out should be recorded in man-days.
General remarks
This section is included to encourage nursery foremen to closely monitor the quality of the plants they
are growing. The specific dates of root -pruning(s) should be recorded here without fail. Notes on
watering, shading, pests and diseases, weeding, fertilizers, etc., should also be included here.
Dispatch
This section provide s information about when, and how many seedlings are sent to be planted in
various locations. It is very important to enable a specific plantation to be traced right back to the
nursery and seed collection from which it originated. This facility is an esse ntial prerequisite for
effective forest management.
The data recorded in this section of the nursery register allow for examination of nursery - and seed-
origin factors which may have contributed to poor survival or growth after planting. Alternatively,
Section 5 may also hold the key reasons as to why a plantation in a certain site was particularly
successful.

65
Such success may in fact be traceable to either good -quality nursery stock or seed of superior genetic
quality. A sufficiently detailed Section 5 m ight be the only available way to identify that desirable
superior genetic source or nursery. After it is identified, this of course creates the opportunity to
disseminate more widely the methods of the identified superior nursery or genetic source.
10.2.1 Keeping records
Good record keeping in the nursery helps to run the nursery well. References to documented records
are important for the current nursery management staff and especially important for any newly
appointed staff that can learn about nursery n eeds and practices by studying the records. Inadequate
record keeping, results in the loss of valuable information about new methods, sources of seed,
suitable planting times and different problems in the nursery.
The main purpose of recording nursery data , activities and experiences is to make planning and
management for the coming years easier. With proper record, upcoming activities can be better
planned. Potential bottlenecks that are apt to occur every year can be better met; deadlines and
production targets for seedling production can be more easily attained. There are 3 types of technical
records that should be kept for the nursery. These are: a daily journal, registers, and inventories.
In addition to these, a financial record is compulsory. All rele vant information in line with daily
operations should be recorded in a journal. The time of sowing of the different species in individual
compartments should be indicated, as well as the time of transplanting and any other treatments given
to the seedlings. The time and the labour used for different nursery operations should also be recorded
daily. Notes about nursery efficiency, the final number of seedlings produced per square meter, etc.,
are useful. A record of water consumption and irrigation practices should also be made. All this
information is essential for a continued successful nursery operation, and together with financial
records, gives the basic data for calculating seedling production costs.
Labels are important for nursery records, to avoidin g mix -ups with species, provenance’s, sowing
dates and other data. The labels should be used from the moment the seeds have been collected until
the seedlings are released to the field. Labels should, at the least, show the seed batch number and the
botanical name of the seedlings. All countries in the world use Latin botanical names for trees. The
use of a Latin name is safe vis-a-vis use of a local name, which likely creates confusion.
10.3 Regular inventories
A thorough nursery inventory should be taken annually to record the seed stock, consumable materials
like plastic tube and fertilizer, tools and expendable equipment’s. The annual inventory is best done
between the dispatch of plants from the previous nursery season and the beginning of the new nurs ery
season. Local materials like watering cans and hoses, wheel barrows, etc., can be procured before the
high nursery season. Purchase orders for imported materials such as plastic tube should also be
prepared at this time since the arrival of such items normally takes up to one year from the date of
ordering.
Seedling production is monitored with monthly inventories. The nursery manager must know at every
moment how many healthy seedlings he has in his nursery to compare against the annual production
target and against the safety margin of seedlings needed to reach this target. It is a normal biological
fact that some seedlings will die before the planting season and another amount may be too weak for
transporting.
The greatest problem occurs with a sudd en dieback of seedlings. If the dieback is not recorded in
time, the achievement of the annual production target may be at risk. By taking regular seedling
inventories, the problem of sudden diebacks can be overcome. If the number of losses is closely
monitored and those pots removed from beds, there remains a possibility to produce additional, fast -
growing seedlings for the coming planting season. Fast growing and simple to raise Sesbania
bispinosa seedlings can be substituted for dead acacias or eucalyptu s. If the latter half of the nursery
season is already at hand, it may be feasible, in case of sudden losses of seedlings, to make enquires at
neighbouring nurseries where it might be possible to obtain the missing seedlings.

66
The first seedling inventory is done immediately after sowing by counting and measuring the number
of beds, the dimensions of the beds (length x width), andthe number of pots per square meter
The next inventory should be taken a week or two after the pricking out. A simple way to do t his is to
take a random sample of 100 pots from every bed. In each sample the number of empty pots and pots
with viable seedlings is recorded, and the survival percent calculated;
Survival %= 100 x no. of viable seedlings
Total number of pots
Such a survival count should be carried out once a month up to the time of lifting.
10.4. Quality control
Besides quantity, the quality of seedlings should be continuously monitored. Empty pots and sick as
well as weak seedlings should be recorded and remove d from production beds.  Seedlings with
diseases must be taken away from the nursery or destroyed by burning or burying with notes taken.
Weak but healthy seedlings can be grown further for possible use in the beating up.
At the time of lifting, seedlings should meet the following requirements: the root - to-shoot ratio
should be in balance, the size should be correct, the seedlings should have no damage and the
seedlings should have a healthy colour.
All seedlings that do not fulfil these requirements, eve n one of them, must be discarded from the
transport. The optimum seedling size for planting is between 15 and 40cm, depending on pot size and
species. The larger the pot, the bigger the seedling can be at planting. If the seedling happens to be
over-sized before the planting, the stem of the seedling has become slender and its ability to endure
transport is low. The root -to-shoot ratio is too small, and such seedlings should not be accepted for
standard planting.
The use of large seedlings favours survival since these can withstand weed competition better than
smaller seedlings. The planting shock, however, is greater for big seedlings, and there will not
necessarily be any advantage in their growth pattern after the first growing season. It is evident that
height alone does not suffice for grading plants. An additional characteristic is the root collar diameter
which correlates highly with seedling survival. The thicker the root collar, the better the survival.
10.5 Transporting of seedlings for field planting
10.5.1 Organization of the work chain
The organization of seedling transport is the last link in the seedling production chain and recording
for the batch. It is the final step between the proper nursery season and the planting season. The
success of plantation establishment is greatly dependent on the efficient lifting, loading and unloading
of seedlings. The handling and transport of seedlings is the easiest if wooden or plastic crates
designed for that purpose are used. Seedling crates are built to standardized dimensions: length 33 cm,
width 17cm and height 25 cm. The weight of one create with seedlings should not be more than about
15kg. The crate capacity depends on the pot size.
An adequately trained and equipped labor force must be available i n advance at both ends of the
transport chain. This is especially important in the field. A truckload of 5,000 to 6,000 plants should
be planted out within 2 hours of their offloading. If a tractor and trailer is used for seedling
transportations, the tran sport efficiency is greatly improved if 2 or 3 trailers can alternate with the
tractor.

67
If transport from the main nursery to the planting site exceeds one hour, strategically located
temporary nurseries, less than 2 to 3km from the planting sites, should be available to facilitate the
chain of transport and planting. Proper attention, however, must be given to the decision to use
temporary nurseries since they always involve a risk of losing some seedlings due to double transport
and often unavoidable water supply problems.
10.5.2 Transport capacity
Seedlings are usually transported from the nursery with trucks and tractors. If the seedling crates are
well designed and well -constructed, they can be loaded in piles one on top of the other. In addition,
plastic bags can be used for short distances. The method of using crates or plastic bags requires a
special device on the truck or tractor platform. Two or more, often 3 loading decks must be
constructed above each other. A truck with three loading decks has a platform area of about 24m 2.
The maximum transport capacity of such a truck can be calculated by loading the seedlings without
crates or plastic bags, vertically in the three decks. The pot size will determine the number of
seedlings per truck load.
A c ommon way of loading seedlings is the so -called “sardine -method”. The seedlings are loaded
horizontally on the truck or tractor -trailer deck above each other, like sardines. This method users the
deck volume most efficiently, but it is detrimental to the s eedlings. The other possibility of
transporting seedlings – over short distance – is to use pack animals or porters. Generally, however,
manual transport and handling of seedlings should be limited to carrying pots from the beds to the
truck and from the t ruck to the planting site. Normal seedling crates can be used; on steep slopes the
seedlings may be carried in back packs.
It is preferable to move seedlings on cloudy or rainy days to prevent desiccation during transport.
When moving seedlings to tempora ry nurseries before the planting season, transport should be done
early in the morning or late in the afternoon.

Annex 3. List of grass species and legumes, suitable environment, propagation methods and their uses
No Name of planting
material Suitable areas Propagation  and Establishment Planting location and use
1 Elephant grass
(Pennisetum
purpureum)
Altitude: Below 2100 masl. At higher
altitudes (above 2100 m), growth is
slowed by lower temperature.
Rainfall. Requires >1000 mm, although it
is extremely drought tolerant because of
its deep root system; It grass can survive
6-8 months of drought. However, in the
establishment phase it needs sufficient
moisture.
Either splits (root splits) or stem cuttings are used for propagation.
Usually by stem cuttings buried in furrows, 2 nodes in soil and one
exposed. One ha of grass provides planting material for 15–20 ha.
Cuttings/splits are planted 0.25- 0.5 m apart. Distance between rows is
0.4-1 m. Close spacing is required for soil conservation contour
hedgerows and for high rainfall environments. More open spacing is used
in drier environments. Needs moisture during planting and establishment.
Elephant grass can survive 6-8 months of drought once established.
It is mainly planted along gully walls and in degraded
grazing areas. Its main use is conservation (Stabilization
of degraded areas) and Fodder.
2 Bana grass
(Pennisetum
purpureum
xP.typhoides)
Same as elephant grass It is propagated by cutting from matured canes or by root splits.
Cuttings/splits are planted 0.25- 0.5 m apart. . Distance between rows is
0.4-1 m. Once established, it is drought tolerant and hardy.
Planted on lower part of gully walls, along soil bunds or
fanya-juu and on range lands. Its main use is
conservation (Stabilization of degraded areas) and
Fodder.
3 Green Gold
(Pennisetum spp.)
Same as elephant grass It is propagated by cutting from matured canes or by root splits.
Cuttings/splits are planted 0.25- 0.5 m apart. .
It is mainly planted on lower parts of the gully and Gully
beds. It needs moist condition for best performance but
will also do under somewhat drier condition. It can stand
water logging.
Its main use is conservation (Stabilization of degraded
areas) and Fodder.
4 Vetiver (Vetiveria
zizanioidesis)
Altitude: Can be grown successfully from
sea level up to 3000 m.a.s.l.
Rain fall:Vetiver has been found to thrive
under rainfall ranging from 300 mm to
6000 mm per annum. It can survive total
drought. It tolerates flood and
submergence and can survive complete
submergence in water for up to three
months. Vetiver ionly s sensitive to shade
and this will slow growth, especially in
young plants.
Vetiver rarely produces seed and is multiplied vegetatively using tillers
(shoots growing from the base of the stem of the plant) or using a clump
(bunch of tillers). 3-4 tillers are per station along the structure or the
contour at an interval of 10 cm.
Vetiver is planted along the contour, soil bunds, Fanya-
juu, across water ways, on boundary of water harvesting
structures, gully buds, gully offset and e.tc. Its main use
is conservation (Stabilization of degraded areas) and
Fodder.
6 Desho grass
(Pennisetum
pedecillatum)
Altitude:Desho grass can grow at 1500-
2800 m.a.s.l and its best performs at an
altitude of 1700-2800 masl
Desho grass can be established by seed and splits (tillered cuttings). One
clump can splitted  to 20 to 30 seedlings (splits). Propagating by splits
have high survival rates and establishes better than grasses which are
seeded. It is established easily with little soil moisture.
Splits of desho grass (Pennisetum pedecillatum) are
planted in lines, using a hand hoe, after good seedbed
preparation Spacing between grass splits is 10 x 10 cm.
It is mainly planted along soil bunds and Fanya-juu and
grazing areas. It is also planted on boundary of water
harvesting structures. For degraded grazing land, the
recommended spacing is 50 cm by 50 cm intervals.
Its main use is conservation (Stabilization of degraded
areas) and Fodder.

7 Chemo grass
(Brachiaria
humidicola)
Altitude:1000-2400 m.a.s.l
Rainfall:In its native place, annual
rainfall varies from 600–2800 mm, but
less vigorous in environments with
<1600 mm annual rainfall and more than
6 months dry season. Grows best in full
sunlight but has moderate shade-
tolerance. Chemo grass is better adapted
to longer dry season.
It is usually established vegetatively,   It establishes reliably and spreads
rapidly from stem cuttings planted at 1 m -2 m spacing.
It is also propagated by seed. Seed may be dormant for 6 months after
harvest and so should be stored or acid-scarified before planting. Seed is
broadcast at 2–8 kg/ha (depending on germination percentage). Seed will
decline in quality rapidly if stored inappropriately and poor seed quality
has been the cause of many planting failures.
It must be stored in low temperature and low humidity conditions to
prevent seed quality decline, which can be severe.
There is very limited flowering and seed production at low latitudes.
It is best suited to  degraded and
termite infested areas. However, it is not suitable to
stabilize soil bunds in crop fields because of its invasive
feature.
Its main use is conservation (Stabilization of degraded
areas) and Fodder. Readily eaten by cattle when kept
short
and leafy. Palatability can be low if grown on acid
infertile soils.
8 Rhodes grass
(Chloris gayana)
Altitude: 600-2200 m.a.sl
Rainfall: 650-1200 mm
Chloris gayana can be vegetatively propagated or established from seeds.
For vegetative propagation, larger clumps can be cut into pieces and
planted at 1 m distance from each other. When propagated by seed, seed
rate is 5-7 kg/ha.
It is planted or sown on degraded grazing areas and gully
beds. Rhodes grass readily establishes and provides
cover within 3 months of sowing. Its creeping habit
provides good soil stabilization and,  is commonly used
for the revegetation of degraded and areas disturbed
soils. It has vigorous root system and is drought tolerant.
Besides, Rhodes grass is used for forage. It is a forage of
high quality.
9 Phalaris (Phalaris
aquatic)
Altitude: 1200-3000 m.a.s.l
Rainfall:It requires 500 mm annual
rainfall with good distribution from
autumn to spring for optimal growth.
However, it can grow in places where
annual rainfall is as low as 300 mm
provided the soil has good moisture
holding capacity.
It propagated by vegetative means (splits) and seed. It good for gully bed, soil bund stabilization, Trench
bund stabilization bank stabilization and excellent for
rehabilitation of water ways.
10 Vetch (Vicia
dasycarpa L.)
Altitude: 1500-3000 m.a.s.l
Rainfall: It can grow on wide rainfall
range, However, it can grow in places
where annual rainfall is as low as 400
mm.
It is propagated by seed at the rate of: 20 kg/ha (pure stand); 12 kg/ha
(under sown); 5-12 kg/ha (pioneer component of pasture mix); 12-20
kg/ha (sown with oats).Companion species: Oats (Avena sativa).
It is mainly grown on farmland for cover cropping and
green manuring. It is also a valuable source of animal
feed.
11 Brachiaria spp.
Hybrids (Cultivar
Mulato )
Altitude: Does not occur naturally. It is
an Artificial hybrids and is suited to low
altitudes from sea level up to 1,800
m.a.s.l.
Rainfall: Adapted to annual rainfall of
1000-3500 mm. 1,000 - 3,500 mm/year,
including areas with a dry season of 5 - 6
months. Experience  shows that these
hybrids may be useful in areas with
annual rainfall as low as 700 mm.
Cv. Mulato can be planted from seed planted into a well-prepared seedbed
at 4–6 kg/ha seed. Can be planted vegetatively from stolon
cuttings. Establishes rapidly, achieving 85% ground cover at 2 months
after seeding. Can be lightly grazed after 3–4 months.
It is initially established by Seed, subsequently vegetative.
It can be grown in hilly and terraced areas which are
characterized by high acidity and high aluminium
contented Mulato is reported to be highly palatable to
grazing ruminants.
It extremely productive and has high nutritive value.

lablab)
Rainfall requirement: 500-1500
Altitudes: From sea level to elevations of
up to 2,000 masl in tropical environments
It is propagated by seed Seeds are sown drilled at 1-2cm depth after rough
seedbed preparation, with seed rate 6 kg/ha in mixture with grass and 15-
20
kg/ha as sole legume.
Good as cover crop and for improved fallows, ley
cropping, green manuring with fodder crops (sorghum,
millet) and few grass. Good as grazed fodder crop.
As good as, and even better than, cowpea (Vigna
sinensis) for green manuring and as a pioneer pasture
legume
13 Panicum or Guinea
grass (Panicum
maximum)
Altitude: 0-2500 meters above sea level
Rainfall: 800-1000 mm
It is propagated by seed. Seed is drilled or broadcasted at 2-3 kg/ha and
should be planted at no more than 1 cm deep. It can  also be established
from rooted tillers (or cuttings with thick stemmed varieties) planted on
the contour every 0.5-0.6 m in rows 1.25-1.5 m apart, or as close as 40 cm
in a triangular pattern if a faster cover is required.
Guinea grass grow vigorously and are ideal for their soil-
binding properties. The deep, dense and fibrous root
system allows guinea grass to survive quite long drought
periods They are also good sources of fodder for
livestock. It can planted  along the contour lines or on
soil bunds, fanya-juu and pasture areas
14 Star grass
(Cynodon
plectostachyus)
Altitude: 800-2000 m.a.s.l
Rainfall: 500-1500 m.a.s.l
Star grass is propagated by planting freshly harvested stem cuttings (1
cutting/m²) at the beginning of the rainy season on a firm seed bed.
Star grass can be sown to protect soils against superficial
erosion and in pasture areas
15 Desmanthus
virgatus
Altitude: sea level to 1,900 m
Rainfall:  550-1,000 mm
It is propagated by seed. Fresh seed is extremely hard and should be
scarified. Sow 2 kg/ha of scarified seed at a depth of 0.5-2.0 cm into moist
soil with at least 50-60 cm depth of good moist soil to ensure
establishment.
Use for alley cropping and green manuring and re-
vegetation of grazing areas
16 Guatemala grass
(Tripsacum
andersonii)
Altitude: sea level up to 1800 m
Rainfall: Requires reliable rain or soil
moisture .
Guatemala grass is usually propagated from stem cuttings or rooted culms
at the beginning of the rainy season. Stem cuttings with 3 nodes or rooted
culms or rhizomes (800–3,000 kg/ha) at spacings of 0.5 m x 1 m. Can be
cut 4–6 months after planting.
Guatemala grass is used for hedges or for contour
stripping of crops planted on steep slopes. Guatemala
grass is a good soil binder and organic matter builder. In
the highlands of East and Central Africa, it is used to
combat soil erosion and increase the stability of contour
bunds. Guatemala grass is more effective when
combined with companion trees such
as Sesbania, Gravillea or Desmodium.
17 Greenleaf
desmodium
(Desmodium
intortum)
Altitude: It does better at altitudes
between 500 and 2500 m in the tropics.
Rainfall:  It can be grown in areas where
annual rainfall is above 900 mm and up
to 3000 mm.
Propagation: Greenleaf desmodium is propagated by seed. Once
established, It is also possible to propagate Greenleaf desmodium by
rooted cuttings. Once established, Greenleaf desmodium grows
vigorously and spreads rapidly because of its solons.  It has very small
seeds and requires a well prepared seedbed for establishment.
Being an N-fixing legume, green leaf desmodium can
improve soil fertility. It can be used as ground cover as it
needs only 4 months to cover the soil.
