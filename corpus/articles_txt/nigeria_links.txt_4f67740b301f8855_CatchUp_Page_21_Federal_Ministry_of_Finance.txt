The Federal Government has officially debunked reports suggesting that the President Bola Ahmed Tinubu-led Administration plans to raise Nigeria’s Value-Added Tax (VAT) from 7.5% to 10%.
In a statement issued earlier this morning, the Honourable Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy Mr Wale Edun clarified that there is no such proposal under consideration, emphasising President Tinubu’s commitment to fiscal stability.
HM Edun highlighted that the current VAT rate remains unchanged, and that the Federal Government is focused on strengthening the economy through sustainable policies aimed at reducing inflationary pressures without burdening citizens. He also stressed that recent fiscal measures, such as suspensions on import duties for key goods, are part of President Tinubu’s efforts to alleviate economic hardship.
The Federal Ministry of Finance remains committed to transparent communication on all tax and economic policy matters, ensuring that citizens are well-informed and not misled by unfounded reports.
The Minister assured the public that any future tax reforms would be announced through official government channels to avoid misinformation.

*1. FOOD INFLATION SEEN REVERSING ON FUEL PRICE HIKE
Business Day, Page 1-31*
In July 2024, food inflation declined to 39.53 percent from 40.87 percent in June. It was a relief for many families who were spending most of their incomes on food. However, the excitement may be temporary given the recent increase in petrol price, according to data analysed by BusinessDay. Data shows that each time the price of premium motor spirit (PMS) or petrol increases, food inflation moves in the same direction.
Food inflation rose from 24.8 percent in May to 25.25 percent in June 2023 when petrol price increased from N200 to N525 per litre after President Tinubu ended the country’s gasoline subsidies on May 29. When the pump petrol price further increased to an average of N617 per litre in July 2023, food inflation rose to 29.3 percent in August 2023 from 26.9 percent in July 2023.
*2. HOW NIGERIA CAN BOOST REVENUES WITHOUT RAISING TAXES
Business Day, Page 1*
Nigeria has one or two lessons to draw from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on how a nation raises its revenue base without necessarily increasing taxes. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is one of the lowest tax nations in the world. It does not impose income tax on citizens, but they only need to pay 5 percent value added tax (VAT) for goods purchased or services rendered, according to the UAE government official website.
The UAE’s corporate tax is nine percent, which it only started implementing in June 2023. This is against 32 percent corporate tax in Portugal, 30 percent in Germany, and 30 percent for Nigeria (large companies), Statista said. Yet, the UAE’s revenue stood at 463.9 billion dirhams ($126.3 billion) in 2021, up 26 percent from 2020, WAM. Its revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $42.45 billion, an 8 percent increase from the further quarter of 2022.

The Nation, Page 15*
Nigeria’s apex capital market regulator, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said that it would commence stringent reviews of activities in the digital assets segment of the capital market to protect investors and forestall the use of the segment for illegal inflows. Director General, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Dr. Emomotimi Agama, said the Commission is committed to protecting investors including those in the crypto space and therefore enjoined participants in the market to play by the rules.
He warned that the regulator would deploy the full weight of the law against individuals and entities that engage in activities that are contrary to laid down regulations in the capital market. “We are certainly going to commence enforcement actions on anyone who wants to operate in this market and does not have the intention of being regulated. This also applies to those in the crypto space.

The Nation, Page 15*

*10. N50 TRANSFER LEVY MAY GROUND FINTECH, ECONOMISTS WARN
The Punch, Page 27*
The Federal Government’s recent move to deduct a N50 Electronic Money Transfer Levy from customers’ transactions has sparked criticism from economists, who warn that the move may discourage digital transactions and harm the economy. The levy, which is set to take effect soon, will apply to every inflow of N10,000 and above received by customers of fintech companies, including OPay and Moniepoint.
According to Former Chief Economist at Zenith Bank, Marcel Okeke, that the move was ill-timed and could have far-reaching negative consequences for the economy, particularly in the fintech sector, which has been growing rapidly in recent years. Okeke argued that the government’s desire to boost revenue through this measure may have unintended consequences, potentially harming the economy and stifling innovation in the fintech sector.

*12. VAT INCREASE’LL DEEPEN ECONOMIC WOES, ATIKU WARNS FG
Daily Sun, Page 6*
Former vice president and 2023 presidential candidate of the peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has warned that the plan by the Federal Government to increase the Value Added Tax (VAT) from 7.5 per cent to 10 percent would worsen the cost of living in the country. Atiku, in a statement, yesterday, alleged that President Bola Tinubu and his wife have resorted to overburdening impoverished citizens while ignoring their own extravagant excesses.
According to him, the endless rise in taxes and interest rates under the present administration is weakening businesses across the country, leading to job losses and increasing the sufferings of the people. He said: “President Bola Tinubu, alongside his coterie of advisers, has resolved to raise the VAT rate from 7.5 percent to 10 percent, even as the NNPCL has announced a soaring PMS price increase at the pump. This move unveils a new era of regressive and punitive policies, and its impact is destined to deepen the domestic cost-of-living crisis and exacerbate Nigeria’s already fragile economic growth.
*13. FG IMPOSES ELECTRONIC LEVY ON OPAY, MONIEPOINT USERS, OTHERS
Daily Trust, Page 23*
The paper reported that the Customers of financial technology (fintech) companies including Opay, Moniepoint and Kuda are grumbling over the implementation of the Electronic Money Transfer Levy (EMTL) on their transactions.
The implementation which takes effect today (Monday) imposes N50 on transfer from N10,000 on fintech account holders as obtained with Deposit Money Banks (DMBs). EMTL, introduced under the Finance Act 2020, places a singular and one-off levy of ₦50 on the recipient of any electronic receipt or transfer of ₦10,000 or above.
DMB account holders have been paying this transfer levy on transfer receipts above N10,000; forcing some of them to register with any of the fintechs with the hope of bypassing the charges.
However, it appears there is no escape route as the federal government has widened its dragnet in its bid to rake in more revenue.
*14. BANKS COLLUDING WITH STATES TO BYPASS FISCAL LAW — FRC
Daily Trust, Page 23*
The Fiscal Responsibility Commission (FRC) has decried the rampant collusion between banks and state governments in violating the provisions of the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Speaking at the National Summit of Fiscal Responsibility in Abuja, the Chairman of FRC, Barrister Victor Muruako, noted that banks had been aiding state governments in circumventing the law, particularly with respect to borrowing.
Muruako cited Section 44.1 of the Fiscal Responsibility Act which mandates that any government or its agencies intending to borrow funds must present a detailed cost-benefit analysis of the proposed borrowing. He said, “We are witnessing a troubling decline in accountability. In one instance, a state government’s secretary simply signed a declaration claiming compliance with the Act, which then allowed the government to proceed with borrowing.
*15. EQUITY MARKET OPENS WEEK WITH N84BN LOSS
Daily Trust, Page 23*

Daily Trust, Page 24*

The issuance of the LTC to UTM FLNG by the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) last Friday came as a major fulfilment of the assurance by President Bola Tinubu in July, 2023, to give all necessary support to the Nigerian company to ensure the actualisation of the landmark gas project.
Tinubu had during an audience with the management of the company and its foreign partners at the State House, Abuja, pledged to remove all impediments to the timely completion of the facility.

Daily Trust, Page 24, Leadership, Page 23*
The Papers reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission has said that it will deploy the full weight of the law against individuals and entities that engage in activities that are contrary to laid down regulations in the capital market. The Director General of the SEC, Dr. Emomotimi Agama in an interview, said the Commission is committed to protecting investors including those in the crypto space and therefore enjoined participants in the market to play by the rules.
“We are certainly going to commence enforcement actions on anyone who wants to operate in this market and does not have the intention of being regulated. This also applies to those in the crypto space. We are sending this signal to all those that want to play by the books that they are welcome to our space. But for those that do not want to play by the books, of course we definitely will not allow them operate within our space,” Agama said. The DG disclosed that the Commission decided to take the recent step of issuing Approval-in-Principle to two crypto exchanges because it observed that Nigerian youths were becoming increasingly interested in the digital space and so it was important to provide regulation, clarity and indeed the protection of investors which is its primary responsibility.
*18. INVESTORS’ RETURN DEPRECIATE BY N1.12TN IN TWO MONTHS
This Day, Page 26*
The Paper reported Nigerian equities market depreciated by N1.12 trillion between July and August 2024, as investors’ profit-taking persisted in some blue-chip companies listed on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX). The downward trend in the two months under review is coming on the backdrop of a hike in the Monetary Policy Rate, leading investors to divest into lucrative high yield Treasury Bills (T-Bills).
An investigation by paper revealed that the market capitalisation in July 2024 dropped by N1.09 trillion or -1.92 per cent to close at N55.514 trillion from N56.602 trillion it opened for trading, while in August 2024, it dropped further by N36.04 billion or 0.06 per cent to close at N55.478 trillion from N55.514 trillion.

Since the removal of fuel subsidies on May 29, 2023, fuel prices have surged by approximately 193 per cent, causing a ripple effects across various sectors.
Manufacturers are particularly affected as the rising costs of fuel and raw materials have led to increased production expenses. Reports indicate that tax revenue from manufacturers plummeted by over 70 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, highlighting the financial strain on the industry.

The Federal Government has taken a significant step towards enhancing the effectiveness of its whistleblowing policy by developing a draft bill to provide legal backing and protection for whistleblowers. This move aims to address the challenges hindering the policy’s implementation and encourage more individuals to report corruption and misconduct in the conduct of government businesses.
Speaking at a one-day sensitization workshop on the implementation of the whistleblowing policy in Nigeria, the Honourable Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Mr. Wale Edun emphasized the government’s commitment to transparency, accountability, and integrity in governance.
He noted that the policy has already shown promise, with significant recoveries made since its inception in 2016.
HM Edun informed that the draft bill being prepared, which is expected to be presented to the National Assembly, seeks to provide a robust legal framework for the protection of whistleblowers and ensure that reports are handled with confidentiality and prompt action.
He said that the President Bola Ahmed Tinubu-led Administration is committed to ensuring that the policy is pursued with strict compliance with the rule of law to achieve transparency and accountability in governance.
The whistleblowing policy, according to him, has recovered funds totalling N83,019,178,375.86; $609,083,391.91;
5,494,743.71 Euros between 2017 and 2023.
However, the government acknowledges that more needs to be done to encourage Nigerians to own the fight against corruption and report financial misappropriation, Edun said
Earlier in his welcome remarks, the Permanent Secretary Special Duties, Federal Ministry of Finance Mr Okokon Ekanem Udo stated that the Whistleblowing policy, since its inception in December 2016, has proven to be one of the veritable tools in uncovering corrupt practices within the public and private sectors. It is aimed at empowering citizens to report to the relevant authorities about identified misappropriation of public funds and other fraudulent activities, thereby contributing immensely towards institutionalisation of transparency and accountability in governance.
However, like other policies of government, Udo said, the implementation of the policy has encountered some challenges. At the initial stage, there was wide-spread enthusiasm on the part of Nigerians about the introduction of the policy. The momentum and popularity that heralded its introduction need to be reinforced and sustained he said.
He informed that the sensitization workshop is designed not only to deepen our understanding of Whistleblowing policy in Nigeria but also to foster cooperation among the key stakeholders, which include the implementing team, the Civil Society Organisations, as well as members of the media.
In her closing remarks, the Permanent Secretary Federal Ministry of Finance, Mrs Lydia Shehu Jafiya, said that it is imperative to focus on strengthening the protection of whistleblowers and safeguard their identities. This, she said, will encourage more individuals to come forward and contribute to the fight against corruption and misconduct.
The Permanent Secretary, who was represented by the Ministry’s Director of Human Resources Mr Olusola Dada
also observed the need for improving Reporting Mechanism so as to make reporting channels more accessible, user-friendly, and effective. It is essential that these mechanisms not only facilitate the reporting of concerns but also ensure that those concerns are addressed promptly and transparently., she said
Mrs Jafiya emphasized that the journey towards an effective Whistleblowing regime is a collaborative effort. Each of us has a role to play in nurturing an environment where integrity and accountability thrive. Let us take the knowledge and enthusiasm generated today and translate it into concrete actions that drive positive change, Jafiya stressed
With the re-invigoration of the Whistleblowing
policy, the government aims to ensure transparency and accountability in the management of public finances and preserve the country’s assets.
The draft bill is a significant step towards achieving this goal and demonstrates the government’s commitment to fighting corruption and promoting good governance.
The one day sensitization workshop is themed: Issues, Challenges and Way Forward

The Honourable Minister’s presentation highlighted the administration’s dedication to tackling this critical issue through innovative initiatives like the Secretariat for Financing Safe Schools and the Home-Grown School Feeding Program.
As the government continues to prioritize education, Nigeria’s future generations can expect improved access to quality learning, setting the stage for a brighter, and more prosperous tomorrow.
