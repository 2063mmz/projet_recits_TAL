A statement issued by Ethiopia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, 3 December 2025, came at a pivotal moment for Nile Basin diplomacy — just days before critical meetings in Burundi that are widely expected to have a decisive impact on the future of the Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA) and the long-anticipated Nile River Basin Commission (NRBC). These institutions — designed to establish equitable, basin-wide water governance — remain unsigned by Egypt, whose refusal has stalled their operationalization for over a decade.
In its statement, Ethiopia condemns the “repeated statements by Egyptian officials categorically rejecting dialogue”, calling them symptoms of Cairo’s inability “to come to terms with the realities of the 21st century.” It further argues that certain Egyptian authorities remain “steeped in a colonial-era mentality”, clinging to the notion that they hold a monopoly over the Nile. The reference is to the 1929 and 1959 colonial treaties, which granted Egypt and Sudan the lion’s share of Nile waters without the consent of upstream states, including Ethiopia which contributes about 86% of the waters of the Nile basin. Ethiopia’s statement sharply denounces what it calls Egypt’s strategy of “invoking colonial-era treaties and hanging on supposed ‘historical rights.”
The timing of the press statement is significant for two reasons: first, the Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA) establishes the principle of equitable and reasonable utilizationand rejects “historic rights”as the basis for allocation. Second, the NRBC, once activated, would become the central basin-wide institution governing joint water management, data sharing, and dispute prevention.Egypt has refused to sign the CFA precisely because it eliminates its historic veto over upstream development. Ethiopia’s statement underscores, “Fair, reasonable and equitable utilization is a cardinal principle of international law applicable in this context.
Ethiopia has no obligation to seek permission from anyone to use natural resources found within its borders.” With Burundi hosting decisive discussions this week, the question of whether more riparian states may move forward without Egypt is at the forefront of diplomatic calculations. The statement also responds — implicitly but clearly — to recent Egyptian claims about the purpose and scale of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). Just weeks earlier, Egypt asserted that the GERD reservoir is “much larger than needed for electricity generation” and accused Ethiopia of seeking “political dominance over the Nile River.” It warned that Egypt would “not tolerate any attempt by Ethiopia to control the river.”
These statements mirror the posture Ethiopia describes as “hostile rhetoric” and “an overt rejection of dialogue.” The MFA statement refutes such allegations by situating GERD within a broader African vision of energy and development: “Ethiopia’s developmental aspirations and projects such as the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) are embodiments of Africa’s self-reliance and progress.” Moreover, Ethiopia stresses that it has repeatedly committed to cooperation: “What the world needs, what Africa needs, is more cooperation and dialogue — not confrontation and conflict.” Far from seeking dominance, Ethiopia argues that it is exercising a sovereign right shared by all upstream states under modern international water law.
“Ethiopia stands firm in assertion of its right to utilize the Abbay River to meet the needs of present and future generations and its openness for win-win solutions based on principles of fairness and equity,” the statement read. The statement clearly presents Egypt’s long-standing pattern of obstruction stating, “Egypt pretended to engage in negotiations while it obstructed progress through its intransigence and insistent on its monopolistic claims. The policy of pretending to negotiate while refusing to engage in any meaningful dialogue has now been made public and direct.”
This reflects the decade-long negotiation cycles on GERD — from the DCIP process, the 2015 Declaration of Principles, through the U.S.-hosted talks, the AU-led process, and subsequent failed rounds. Throughout the negotiations process, Ethiopia’s arguments have been grounded on the principle of Limited Territorial Sovereignty, which emphasizes the equitable and reasonable utilization of water with no significant harm. The statement situates Ethiopia’s stance within its historical role: “Ethiopia has a long and proud history of espousing Pan-Africanism and supporting anti-colonial struggles throughout the continent. Ethiopia has no room to accommodate vestiges of colonialism that Cairo is finding difficult to eschew.” By invoking Pan-African solidarity, Ethiopia implicitly frames the CFA/NRBC reform effort as part of a continent-wide shift away from colonial water governance.
With Burundi set to host decisive consultations at the end of this week that may finally determine the operationalization of the CFA and NRBC, the region stands at a watershed moment. Ethiopia’s position is unequivocal: “Ethiopia stands firm in assertion of its right to utilize the Abbay River to meet the needs of present and future generation and remains open to win-win solutions based on principles of fairness and equity.” As the basin awaits the outcome of the Burundi meetings, the political divide is clear: historic rights vs. equitable rights, colonial treaties vs. modern international law, zero-sum perceptions vs. cooperative development. The choices made this week could reshape Nile Basin governance for decades.
