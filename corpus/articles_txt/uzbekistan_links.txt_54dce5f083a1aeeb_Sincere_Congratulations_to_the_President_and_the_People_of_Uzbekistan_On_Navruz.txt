I cordially congratulate Your Excellency, Your esteemed family members and the friendly people of Your country on the advent of the Navruz holiday, which brings joy to hearts, the rebirth of nature and the home country, marks the beginning of the new 1401 Hijri year.
Navruz is a symbol and embodiment of a civilization based on the values of piety, love for family and peacefulness. Dear Prophet of Islam (may Allah bless and greet him, his descendants and great companions) said: «When you see a spring, recall a Judgement Day».
To contemplate the greatness of creation and pay attention to the changes in nature is an impetus to the awakening of the soul, a means of remembering Allah, a path to progress and the elevation of humanity. The great poet Saadi Shirazi in his lines urged to appreciate the beauty of spring and nature, which are a reminder of the creative power of the Almighty.
I hope that in the new Hijra century, the movement towards higher divine and human values will accelerate, as well as this century will bring more joyful and pure days, such as Navruz, for all people living in Your country and more lasting peace and unity for all the peoples of the region. The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that strengthening this cultural solidarity will bring peace and tranquility to the region and the world, and thus sincerely extends the hand of friendship to all countries.
I ask Almighty Allah to grant You, Your Excellency, a sound health and success, as well as happiness and prosperity to the people of the friendly and fraternal Republic of Uzbekistan.
Ebrahim Raisi,
The President of the Islamic Republic of Iran
