Mr Putin, my dear friend, welcome to China
for the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. Participation
in each other’s major international events is a good long-term tradition for our countries.
Mr President, it is your third visit to the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, which demonstrates Russia’s
support for this initiative.
During my
visit
, at your invitation, to Russia in March – this was my first visit after the re-election – we set a landmark for the development of bilateral relations and held a meaningful exchange of views on a number of current international and regional issues.
I am pleased to note that the governments, ministries and agencies, as well as regions of China and Russia have been working hard to implement the important agreements we have reached.
Mutual trust in our political relations is steadily growing. Close and effective strategic collaboration is being maintained. Bilateral trade has
achieved historic records and is approaching the target of $200 billion we have
set.
Mr President, during the ten years since 2013, the two of us have held 42 meetings and established good business-like relations
and a strong personal friendship.
Next year marks the 75
anniversary
of diplomatic relations between China
and Russia.
The Chinese side is ready, together
with Russia, with keen understanding of the trajectory of history and following
the currents of world development, to invariably rely on the fundamental
interests of the peoples of the two countries, to continuously enrich bilateral
cooperation with the content necessary for the sake of the two countries’ development
and prosperity in this new era; exercise a sense of responsibility as great
powers, contribute to international justice and impartiality, and promote the common development of the whole world.
Thank you.
President of Russia
Vladimir Putin:
Xi Jinping, dear friend,

I am happy we are having this new meeting. Allow me once again, this
time personally, to congratulate you and all our Chinese friends on the 74
anniversary of the establishment of the People’s Republic of China.
Next year will be an anniversary year for both your country and the diplomatic relations between our countries. On October 2, 1949, the next day
after the establishment of the PRC, the USSR was the first to recognise new
China.
As you have just said, your state visit to Russia took place in March,
the first foreign visit after your re-election. We understand that this is a special sign indicating the level and nature of relations between the People’s
Republic of China and Russia.
One and a half years after my last
visit
, all of us, our large
delegation, are in Beijing again. We can see that the city is developing and prospering,
and we are very glad for our Chinese friends.
Your idea of promoting wide-ranging cooperation between the countries of the historical Silk Road, which was put forward ten years ago, has gained
momentum.
As I just said in my remarks at the forum, each country leader, when
planning something in the area of economy or development, seeks to implement
the plans that have been devised. Yet, we are never 100-percent sure how this
will turn out. But our Chinese friends, China under your leadership, and you
personally are highly successful in your endeavours. We are very glad for you
and for all those involved in this wide-ranging collaboration, because everyone
gains advantages from it.
You have just outlined a very strong and extensive programme to further
promote your road and destiny idea intended to benefit, in effect, as you say
yourself, the whole of humankind. We sincerely wish you success in this noble
undertaking.
Under the difficult present-day conditions, it is particularly relevant
to maintain close foreign policy coordination, something we are doing now.
Today, we will discuss all of this, including, and primarily, our bilateral
relations.
You have just mentioned our bar – our objective of reaching $200 billion
in trade this year. If we look at the year-on-year figures – we analysed this yesterday
evening – the 200-billion target was reached between this day a year ago and today, and this bar will certainly be exceeded by the end of the calendar year.
Therefore, we are advancing very confidently on the bilateral plane as well.
Thank you.
