China and global governance in Africa was discussed intelligibly by Assoc. Prof. Joshua
Bolarinwa,theDirectorofResearchattheInstitute.Heexplainedthemodesthroughwhich China
is expanding its global influence through cooperation with Africa, via BRI and FOCAC. These
programs promote a governance style based on respect and mutual benefit, contrasting with
Western conditional aid. In the process, China strengthens Africa’s voice globally while
showcasingitsleadershipinglobalgovernance.
Dr. Adesuwa Erediauwa, the Co-ordinator of the Bashir Adeniyi Centre for International Trade
and Investment (BACITI), an arm of the Institute, deliberated onChina’s private sector
engagement and how it is evolving within a changing global order. She explains that the old
Western-ledeconomicsystemisweakeningduetoglobalrivalriesandnationalism,andAfricais
now asserting more control over its development. China’s partnerships through the BRI and
FOCAC are helping Africa industrialize by building infrastructure, processing minerals locally,
