The Blue-Green Deal, introduced by Dr. Gashaw Ayferam and Dr. Gizachew Asrat, offers a visionary blueprint for Northeast Africa’s future. This initiative harnesses the potential of freshwater and seawater resources, especially with the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (#GERD) and access to the #RedSea.
Ethiopia can transform historical tensions into cooperation through its rivers and strategic waterways. By focusing on sustainable development in hydropower, fisheries, and maritime trade, the Blue-Green Deal aims to foster peace and prosperity in a resource-rich, yet conflict-prone, region.
This framework highlights interdependence, promoting collaboration between landlocked Ethiopia and its coastal neighbors.
