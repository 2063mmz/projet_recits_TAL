Ethiopia has officially launched the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement, marking a major step toward export diversification and regional economic integration across Africa.
Speaking at the ceremony, H.E. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (PhD) highlighted the transformative potential of the AfCFTA for Africa’s shared prosperity.
“The new frontier for Africa is regional integration — where minds are open to ideas and markets are open to trade,” he stated.
The Prime Minister affirmed Ethiopia’s strong commitment to deepening continental cooperation and economic sovereignty through shared markets and open trade.
The AfCFTA, under the African Union framework, aims to establish a single continental market for goods and services, enabling free movement of businesspersons and investments while driving industrialization and sustainable growth.
H.E. Abiy noted that this milestone sets a solid foundation for advancing Africa’s integration agenda and reaffirmed Ethiopia’s readiness to play a leading role in strengthening continental cooperation.
He further emphasized Ethiopia’s determination to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) to expand participation in global trade frameworks.
“Africa’s collective destiny is best shaped through cooperation, shared markets, and interdependence,” he concluded.
