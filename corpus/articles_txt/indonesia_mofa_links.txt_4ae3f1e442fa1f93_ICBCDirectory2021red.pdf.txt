ABOUT ICBC
1
Established in January 2018, Indonesia Cambodia
Business Club (ICBC) is a communication forum between
Cambodian entrepreneurs and Indonesian entrepreneurs in
Cambodia. ICBC was initiated Indonesia-Cambodian Bussines
Communities with full support from the Embassy of the Republic
of Indonesia in Cambodia.
The main goal of ICBC is to share information, experience, and
best practices to do business in Cambodia. Members of ICBC
actively participate in events which are held or arranged by the
Embassy, such as Indonesian Trade and Tourism Promotion
(ITTP), Trade Expo Indonesia (TEI), and also Cambodia Export-
Import Exhibition (CIE Expo).

Cambodia is one of the alternative potential markets for
Indonesian market, especially that the real industrial sector in
Cambodia has not yet been able to produce daily needs and also
the priority sector such as garment, tourism, and construction.
The trend of trade balance between Indonesia and Cambodia in
the last five years continue to grow around average 10,26% from
2015-2019.
From January-November 2020, the total trade volume between
Indonesia and Cambodia reached US$ 540.15  million. Some of
the famous Indonesian products in Cambodia includes food and
packaged beverages, home care products and automotive,
personal care, pharmacy, fresh salak fruit, and vehicles.
Indonesian pharmacy product is well known by Cambodians for
as a middle-class product and trusted by the people.
In order to enhance the penetration of Indonesian product to
Cambodia, the Embassy actively collaborate with ICBC to
conduct business meetings and matchings, join exhibitions held
by the Embassy (Indonesia Trade and Tourism Promotion -
ITTP), the Indonesian Government (Trade Expo Indonesia - TEI),
or the Cambodian Government  (Cambodia Export and Import -
CIE).
HIGHLIGHTS INDONESIA -
CAMBODIA ECONOMIC
COOPERATION
2

Indonesia and Cambodia in the recent years have been enjoying
great economic bilateral cooperation, with the steady increase of the
bilateral trade. This trade cooperation is also not without the
contribution of the Indonesian and Cambodian entrepreneurs and
business communities who are joined in the Indonesia-Cambodia
Business Club (ICBC).

Despite the disruption and hardship that has been caused by the
Covid-19 pandemic, Indonesia and ICBC have collaborated in
various events throughout 2020. These events include joint
promotions, hybrid business matching through virtual and on-site
meeting, and also business gatherings.

This year, in order to take one step further in enhancing the
cooperation, the Indonesian Embassy initiated the ICBC Directory
2021. This E—book comprises the business information of the
members of ICBC.

I hope that this book will be a useful reference for entrepreneurs and
business communities to conduct strong networking between
Indonesia and Cambodia.

Thank you.

INDONESIAN PROMOTION IN
CAMBODIA (INDOPROCAM)
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic which caused challenges in doing face-
to-face promotion, the Indonesian Embassy launched the Facebook
Fanpage Indonesian Promotion in Cambodia or INDOPROCAM.
INDOPROCAM is one of the Embassy's efforts in supporting the
economic diplomacy by making use of social media, especially during the
COVID-19 pandemic. It is expected that the Indonesian business people
who have ready export products or tour package could take advantage of
INDOPROCAM to promote their products. Facebook Fanpage is chosen
as the means of promotion because of the high amount of Facebook
users in Cambodia, which are around 9.7 million users, so that
information and promotion dissemination could easier reach all Facebook
users in Cambodia.
