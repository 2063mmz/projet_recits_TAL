We have taken our relationship with China very seriously”–Tegbe
In this Exclusive Interview with Joseph Tegbe, Director-General and Global Liaison for the Nigeria-China Strategic Partnership, Tegbe who was in China on a working visit, speaks extensively on the purpose of his office, his view of China, visit of Chinese FM to Nigeria, FOCAC, plans, vision and sundry issues. Q: welcome to China, how many times have you been to China? A: Thank you very much. This is my 13th time in China. The first time that I was in China was in 2002, then I came back in 2006, I was here for Beijing Olympics with my family in 2008 and subsequently, I have been here a couple of times. It is great to be back in China. Q: I remember you told me that everytime that you come to China, you could see that China is changing. You said China is changing very fast. So, what kind of change do you mean? A: Everytime I come to China, everything is improved, especially in infrastructure. I see a lot of infrastructural development in China and again, beyond that, I see that China has over the last twenty years become self-sufficient and I always marvel at the discipline of the Chinese. Overtime, the integration of China with the rest of the world is improving and China is becoming a metropolitan country. Q: Many of my Chinese and Nigerian friends have asked me about the nature, type and organization of the Nigeria-China strategic office. Whether it is governmental or nongovernmental. Can you give us more information? A: Let me give you an introduction to the Nigeria-China strategic office. It is a government office setup in the Presidency of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. I have my background in the private sector. Before, I spent thirty-five years working with Arthur Andersen, a renowned American firm in consultancy. I also worked with KPMG and I retired from KPMG last year after thirty-five years of working in KPMG. Before my career in consulting, I had a stint in Engineering. I graduated with a first class in Civil Engineering, mastering in structures and then I specialized in human resources strategy, technology and public sector advisory. Now, the Nigeria-China strategic partnership office was set up in September, 2024. It is just about 3 months to 4 months old. At the September 2024 FOCAC here in Beijing, President Xi Jinping and President Bola Ahmed Tinubu agreed to elevate the relationship between China and Nigeria to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. On the basis of that, we have taken our relationship with China very seriously. We elevated our relationship with China and President Bola Ahmed Tinubu decided to appoint me as the Director-General and Global Liaison for Nigeria and China Strategic Partnership. What are my roles? Number one is to coordinate, monitor and evaluate all the agreed projects between Nigeria and China agreed at FOCAC. There were 54 programmes and projects that were agreed in the MOUs that were signed between the two countries. Those projects span from infrastructure to agriculture to health care to education to mining, manufacturing and technology. Now, in the past few years, when those things are agreed, you don’t have a central point for coordination. So, my role is to coordinate and ensure that those projects and programmes are adequately implemented. But beyond that, my secondary role is to ensure that all relationship between Nigeria and China from the perspective of business and economy are properly evaluated and properly monitored and ensure there is value for money and a win-win relationship between China and Nigeria. That is what my role is. But underlying that, you cannot do business, you cannot do economic development without some level of diplomacy. So, I work with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other Ministries in Nigeria and the Ambassador, the Chinese Ambassador to Nigeria and now Ambassador in Beijing here, the Charge d’ Affaires, to ensure there is coordination. So that is what my role is. Q: In recent years, China and Nigeria have jointly implemented a large number of strategic cooperation projects under FOCAC that you have just mentioned. Could you tell us about these achievements and cooperation between China and Nigeria in recent years? A: The relationship between China and Nigeria dated back to over fifty years ago. And the relationship between Nigeria and China has always been very cordial. China has always respected Nigeria and Nigeria significantly respects China. FOCAC projects that are agreed span across those seven sectors I mentioned earlier. But most importantly, in the last couple of years, there has been a lot of infrastructure development in Nigeria, championed and facilitated by China. China has been assisting Nigeria with funding and with technology and expertise in the area of infrastructure. Most of the major infrastructure development in Nigeria today, are carried out by Chinese companies. And they do not only do the building and development, they maintain. Many companies like China Communications Construction Company have played major roles in Nigeria, developing our roads, developing our ports. And then in the railway sector, China has played a significant role and they continue to play roles that in the next few years, you are going to see China moving from infrastructure and getting involved in things like agriculture, technology and education. And beyond that, I will tell you, China has played a significant role in our telecommunication sector. Companies like Huawei were early comers in Nigeria. So, today, some of the FOCAC projects have played a significant role in developing Nigeria and it has been a very mutual relationship. Q: Early this month, we are aware that a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Foreign Minister, Mr. Wang Yi, His Excellency, paid a very successful visit to Nigeria. What are your comments concerning Mr. Wang’s bilateral talks with President Tinubu and Minister Tuggar. What is the impact of this visit on China-Nigeria relations? A: Thank you very much. Mr. Wang Li who is a very respected Chinese Minister and
COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP: A NEW ERA IN NIGERIA-CHINA RELATIONS (News Analysis)
“There is no better mirror than a best friend,” says an African proverb. From all indications, the axiom appears quite apt while assessing the current state of Nigeria-China relations, which have spanned over five decades. This is because the bilateral relations existing between Nigeria and People’s Republic of China, which began after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two nations in February 1971, have significantly flourished to a level that culminated in the attainment of a Strategic Partnership in 2005; lately upgraded into a “Comprehensive Strategic Partnership”. It is pertinent to note that in September 2023 — on the sidelines of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) summit in Beijing – Nigeria’s President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, signed the joint statement on the ratification of the partnership upgrade. The Chinese Ambassador to Nigeria, Yu Dunhai, who also witnessed the event in Beijing, said that the upgrade of the Nigeria-China relations to the “Comprehensive” level represented a boost to the decades-long bilateral relations between the two countries, which have entered a “New Era”. It will be recalled that at the FOCAC summit in Beijing, President Tinubu and President Xi issued a joint statement, on behalf of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and People’s Republic of China, regarding the building a high-level China-Nigeria community with a shared future. The joint statement particularly covered and focused on four aspects — high-level strategic mutual trust, high-level development cooperation, high-level mutual assistance and high-level mutual understanding – which underscored the essence of establishing a comprehensive strategic partnership, while mapping out the blueprint for the future development of Nigeria-China relations in the new era. The validation of the new era strategic partnership between the two sides entailed the adoption of 13 cooperation documents, covering areas such as high-quality Belt and Road Initiative cooperation and planning, the implementation of the Global Development Initiative, economic growth, human resources, application of the Beiduo Satellite Navigation System, export of peanuts to China and media exchanges. In addition to the 13 cooperation documents, one particular aspect of the partnership entails about 19 projects, which Nigeria and China are jointly executing.Shortly after his return from the FOCAC summit in Beijing, President Tinubu adopted a proactive approach to ensure that the cooperation agreements, which were signed, were duly implemented. Accordingly, President Tinubu approved the establishment of the Nigeria-China Strategic Partnership (NCSP) and appointed Mr. Joseph Tegbe, as its Global Liaison and Director-General, with a mandate of overseeing the implementation of the signed agreements through engagement with the Chinese counterparts, while ensuring the alignment of all deliverables with national development goals. In addition, in the strategic plan, the NCSP is expected to outline specific deliverables, timeliness and key performance indicators for each area of cooperation, including priority projects, projected investments and expected socio-economic outcomes. Tegbe, the Director-General of NCSP, who spoke on his assignment in a recent interview with a Chinese media outfit in Beijing, emphasized that there were 54 programmes and projects that were approved in the MOUs which were signed between the two countries. He added that these encompassed projects in infrastructure, agriculture, health care, education, mining, manufacturing and technology sectors, among others. He underscored the wisdom in creating the NCSP office to coordinate and ensure the proper implementation of the projects and programmes, recalling that in the past when such partnerships were created, the perceptible lacuna was the absence of a central point for their coordination. Tegbe, reiterated that his central role was to ensure the coordination of all NCSP projects and programmes, while overseeing their hitch-free implementation. He emphasized that his secondary role as the D-G of NCSP was to ensure that the business and economic relations between Nigeria and China were properly evaluated and monitored, so as to ensure value for money and promote a win-win relationship between the two countries. As the Nigeria-China relations continue to grow and flourish over the years, observers note that landmark achievements have been recorded in the execution of several projects, which are either ongoing or completed. They point at the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge rail line, Abuja-Kaduna standard gauge rail line, rehabilitation of six airport terminals rehabilitation, Lekki Deep Seaport, Abuja-Keffi-Makurdi expressway, Abuja rail mass transit and Lagos rail mass transit as accomplishments. Other feats are recorded in infrastructure development, agro-industry, education, technology transfer, healthcare and telecommunication, among other development projects, they add. All in all, analysts have expressed optimism that the mutual bond between Nigeria and China will continue to flourish via the pragmatic adoption of mutually beneficial practices that are based on inclusiveness, equal opportunities, people-to-people engagements and mutual respect for one another; all in the face of the diversity of cultures and political systems. Obviously, there exists a new epoch in Nigeria-China relations that would be mutually beneficial to the two nations, under the aegis of Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. — Sale is an Abuja-based Global Affairs Analyst (lawalmaida1@yahoo.com)
