Ethiopia continues to strengthen its position as a leading advocate for peace, stability, and reconstruction across Africa. The opening of the 17th International Training on Post-Conflict Stabilization and Reconstruction in Addis Ababa highlighted the country’s growing influence in shaping dialogue on conflict recovery and sustainable development.
Organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Romania in partnership with Ethiopia’s Institute of Foreign Affairs (IFA), the program reflects a shared understanding that building lasting peace requires cooperation between local, regional, and global actors. It also demonstrates Ethiopia’s readiness to transform its own experiences in peacebuilding into lessons and inspiration for the continent.
H.E. Jafar Bedru, Executive Director of IFA, emphasized that African nations are working diligently to move from instability toward sustainable peace and stronger institutions. He noted that the diversity of participants from across Africa, representing a wide range of experiences and perspectives, stands as one of the program’s greatest strengths. This diversity, he said, reflects Africa’s collective will to lead its own path toward stability.
“Your presence here demonstrates our shared belief that post-conflict reconstruction must be led by local actors, strengthened through regional cooperation, and supported by global partnerships,” he stated.
H.E. Jafar also underscored Ethiopia’s National Dialogue and Transitional Justice process as a central pillar of its peacebuilding journey. These initiatives are designed to heal divisions, rebuild trust, and strengthen national unity. They also serve as examples of Ethiopia’s homegrown approach to resolving internal challenges through dialogue rather than confrontation.
IFA, he added, continues to serve as a bridge between diplomacy and peacebuilding, equipping diplomats, policymakers, and regional actors with the tools and knowledge needed to promote peace and cooperation.
H.E. Lulia Pataki, Ambassador of Romania to Ethiopia, described the training as a cornerstone of Romania’s Africa strategy. She highlighted that the program’s focus on combating disinformation is particularly timely, as misinformation continues to threaten peace, stability, and development across the world. She noted that this forum creates valuable opportunities for connection, learning, and the exchange of expertise on how to prevent instability and rebuild societies.
H.E. Daniela Dobre, Director General of the Romanian Agency for International Development, added that the training has evolved from a technical initiative into a genuine platform for dialogue and collaboration. Bringing together civilian and military experts, policymakers, and practitioners from across Africa and beyond, the program underscores the power of cooperation in shaping shared solutions.
“The last three editions have shown us that collaboration and knowledge sharing are among the most powerful tools for building peace and stability,” she observed.
Ethiopia’s active engagement in this initiative once again highlights its role as both a participant and a leader in continental peacebuilding. By sharing its experiences and promoting African-led solutions, the country continues to demonstrate that stability, dialogue, and institutional resilience are essential foundations for the continent’s collective progress.
The five-day program combines theoretical and practical sessions aimed at strengthening regional capacity, encouraging collaboration, and empowering African nations to turn shared challenges into opportunities for peace, growth, and sustainable reconstruction.
