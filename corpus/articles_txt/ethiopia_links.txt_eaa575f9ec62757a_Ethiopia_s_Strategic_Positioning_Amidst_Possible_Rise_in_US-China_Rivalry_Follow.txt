The world watches with bated breath as the newly elected American president’s policy directions—spanning economic, social, political, and diplomatic realms—begin to take shape. Regardless of the specific strategies, a profound shift in global and regional geopolitical dynamics across Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Africa is widely anticipated.
The tenure of outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden has been marked by significant global developments. Key events include the deteriorating relationship with numerous East African States, the cancellation of the AGOA preference for five African States, escalating Ukraine war, the Israel-Palestine war, the expansion of BRICS+, and the civil war as well as worsening humanitarian situation in Sudan. The Horn of Africa, a critical geopolitical hotspot and a focal point of intense competition among global powers, including China, is no exception.
President-elect Donald Trump has signaled plans for a more aggressive stance toward China, building on his hardline approach during his previous term. In pre-election speeches and the “Project 2025” blueprint, Trump hinted at intensifying economic warfare with China, potentially adopting more confrontational trade policies than those of the Biden administration. These strategies aim to curtail China’s global economic influence through heightened protectionism, significant tariff adjustments, and stringent regulations. Such measures are likely to reshape U.S.-China relations dramatically. For countries in the Horn of Africa-particularly Ethiopia, which has been a major recipient of Chinese financial assistance and investment; this shift could bring complex and far-reaching consequences, compelling recalibration of strategies amidst the evolving geopolitical and economic landscape.
If carefully managed, the shifting dynamics of U.S.-China rivalry in the Horn of Africa could present more opportunities than challenges, particularly for Ethiopia. Analysts highlight that a key shortcoming of Donald Trump’s previous presidency was its relegation of Africa, and the Horn of Africa in particular, to a secondary priority, with limited focus and engagement. In addition to creating an opening for other global players, notably China, to deepen their influence in the region, his approach was sometimes swayed by actors like Egypt, leading to controversial moments like his widely criticized remarks on the GERD. However, his administration’s effort to bring Ethiopia and Egypt to the negotiating table on the dam issue remains a notable achievement.
As Donald Trump returns to the presidency, there is hope that his administration will address past policy missteps and recognize the strategic significance of the Horn of Africa for global trade and security. This could pave the way for stronger, more beneficial partnerships with Africa, and particularly the Horn region. For Ethiopia, the challenge lies in its capability in seizing whatever opportunities that arise from the rivalry between the US and China while carefully balancing its relationships with both. How Ethiopia navigates these shifting geopolitical and economic dynamics will also play a crucial role in shaping its future position on the global stage. This article examines the impacts Trump’s second presidency might have on the geopolitical and economic landscapes of the Horn of Africa specifically addressing how Ethiopia can navigate through the complex web of opportunities and challenges that can arise from heightened U.S.-China rivalry in the region.
A defining aspect of outgoing President Joe Biden’s administration was its renewed geostrategic and economic engagement with Africa, aiming to counter China’s growing influence, particularly in key strategic areas, while adopting a more measured tone and reduced reliance on military approaches. In contrast, President-elect Donald Trump appears poised to adopt a more aggressive stance toward China. Unlike Biden, Trump favors transactional, bilateral relationships over institutional frameworks that promote multilateral cooperation, signaling a different approach to U.S.-Africa relations.
Donald Trump has consistently framed China as a strategic adversary, yet his “America First” approach and reduced focus on multilateral engagement signals a shift in the geopolitical landscape that could diminish the U.S.’s role in global affairs. America’s withdrawal from key global institutions, including the cancellation of agreements like the Paris Climate Accord and the Iran Nuclear Deal, has created space for China to expand its influence over global issues and governance structures. Additionally, the recent growth of opposing blocs like BRICS further weakens U.S. involvement in international forums, potentially giving China an advantage in reshaping the global order and accelerating its pursuit of global leadership.
Trump’s nationalist, protectionist trade policies threaten to heighten tensions with China, while also calling for substantial tariffs on goods from all trade partners, with especially harsh measures targeting Chinese imports. It appears that Trump is prepared to take strong action to challenge China’s dominance in critical sectors such as green technology, energy production, and electric vehicle manufacturing, potentially reshaping global supply chains and prompting shifts in international alliances.
In such an evolving scenario, Ethiopia, a key regional player and renewable energy hub, will likely find itself caught in the complexities of this rivalry, especially in its pursuit of a transition to green energy and environment-friendly economic development.
China is increasingly influential in the Horn of Africa, significantly shaping the geopolitical and economic landscape following the Trump administration. The Belt and Road Initiative has dramatically transformed the region through substantial investments in vital sectors like infrastructure, energy, and telecommunications. Ethiopia, as one of the BRI’s focal points, has seen massive Chinese investments. Although China’s investments in Ethiopia are fostering economic growth, concerns about debt trap and erosion of sovereignty are not difficult to come by. Such fault lines in Africa–China relations would serve Trump’s US to recalibrate its geo-economic engagement with Africa, in general, and countries of the Horn region, in particular.
Historically, the U.S. has been a key source of development aid to Ethiopia, but its emphasis on governance and human rights has created a complex diplomatic environment for Ethiopia as it strives to become a regional power amid the U.S.-China rivalry. With China playing a major role in Ethiopia’s infrastructure development and the U.S. prioritizing democratic reforms and security cooperation, the stakes are high. As Trump’s incoming administration is expected to focus more on geo-economic engagements, the pressing question remains: how can Ethiopia effectively navigate this complex landscape?
Opportunities and Challenges
Following the recent implementation of macroeconomic policy reforms, Ethiopia is now strategically positioned to diversify its economy and attract foreign direct investment. With a goal of building a more resilient economy, Ethiopia has pledged to expand its international partnerships, moving away from the limited funding sources it previously relied on. Balancing its relationships with both China and the U.S. presents Ethiopia with both opportunities and challenges. In addition to raising concerns about global economic stability, the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s proposed economic and trade policies poses significant challenges for emerging economies like Ethiopia.
The ongoing tensions over the GERD—a contentious issue with Egypt and Sudan—present another significant concern for Ethiopia as Trump returns to office. Egypt’s involvement in the Middle East “mediation” efforts, its role in the Abraham Accord, and its comparative advantage in lobbying U.S. Congress members to influence opinions on the GERD highlight the potential for the new administration’s stance to be swayed against Ethiopia’s interests and could intensify pressure on Ethiopia and its developmental needs. As a response, Ethiopia must pursue a more robust diplomatic engagement with the new administration while also strengthening cooperation with riparian countries that have ratified the CFA as a strategic alternative.
As the Horn of Africa region continues to grapple with persistent conflict and instability, the issue is further complicated by the involvement of major powers like the U.S. and China, among other state actors. For Ethiopia, navigating these competing interests is essential to strengthening its security strategy, and calls for enhancing military ties with the U.S. for defense assistance and leveraging China’s investments in security infrastructure are critical steps in addressing terrorist threats and regional instability. By engaging with both powers, Ethiopia can strategically balance its alliances while effectively addressing the pressing security challenges.
Conclusion
With the new phase of U.S.-China relations in the wake of Trump’s reelection, Ethiopia is at a critical turning point, facing both opportunities and challenges that can be leveraged to enhance its influence in the Horn of Africa. Ethiopia has the potential to strengthen its geopolitical and geo-economic position by diversifying its international partnerships and employing a proactive diplomatic strategy. The choices made by Ethiopia today will significantly impact its internal stability and its future regional diplomatic posture, ultimately affecting the broader dynamics of the Horn of Africa for years to come.
