We Need To Talk About West Papua
Executive Summary
On August 16-17, 2019, several members of T entara Nasional Indonesia (TNI, lit.
Indonesian National Army, Indonesian army) allegedly called Papuan students at the
Papuan Student Dormitory in Surabaya, East Java, with racist remarks “monkeys. ” Later
known as the Surabaya Incident, the inappropriate comments caused protests from
various circles, especially by indigenous Papuans. On August 19, 2019, the Governor
of East Java Khofifah Indar Parawansa expressed her sincere apology for the racism
incident.
The following month, twin protests took place in Wamena and Jayapura, Papua
Province, which bloomed into riots on September 23, 2019. Many suspected that the
Free Papua separatist group was the riot’s initiator because the Surabaya Incident
racism issue got bigger after being resolved legally, instead of diminishing like the racism
cases in other parts of Indonesia. Through various media, such as conventional media
and social media, Papuan separatists escalated the Surabaya Incident and steered it
into a separatism issue. Another indication can be from the riots’ timing that coincided
with the 2019 UN Session held in New York, United States, on September 17-30, 2019.
A year later, Free Papua separatists took advantage of the Black Lives Matter issue
in mid-2020 to raise their hashtag, Papuan Lives Matter, to raise the issue of Papua
again ahead of the 2020 UN Session, which was held on September 15, 2020, in New
York, United States. Fortunately, the issue’s escalation did not bloom into something
destructive like Wamena-Jayapura Riots, September 23, 2019. In the past 2 years,
several separatist figures’ names were proven to have initiated Wamena-Jayapura
Riots and were arrested as political prisoners.
Free Papua separatists and the Indonesian government continue their tug of war. On
the one hand, separatists still exploit Papuan history’s dualism as the basis for the
struggle for independence. On the other hand, the Indonesian government has a legal
basis that defines Papua as an integral part of the Republic of Indonesia. Separatist
organizations also continue to develop within Indonesia and abroad, even though there
are indications of division between them because each organization carries different
interests.
Meanwhile, the Indonesian Government continues to strive to meet the Papuan
people’s basic needs through various progressive policies. After President Suharto’s
regime collapsed, President Bacharuddin Jusuf (B. J.) Habibie opened a dialogue with
Papuans. The next Indonesian president, Abdurrahman Wahid, expressed his apology
and opened a wider dialogue with Papuans. The following Indonesian presidents then
began to add more programs that support the Papuan people’s needs. In recent years,
development in West Papua has increased massively, especially in education, health,
infrastructure, and transportation. These steps are Indonesia’s effort to be present and
answer the needs of indigenous Papuans.

We Need To Talk About West Papua
The Free Papua separatist movement does not stand alone. The involvement of
various parties made the Free Papua Movement possible. Various foreign political and
economic interests from several countries have allegedly provided support for the
separatists. For example, one of the prime ministerial candidates in the 2020 Vanuatu
general election, Ralph Regenvanu of the Vanuatu Justice and Land Party, used the
Free Papua issue to get votes.
The Free Papua separatists’ interests are not based solely on the indigenous Papuan
people’s interests but rather to accommodate the sponsors’ interests.
On the other hand, the Indonesian government investigates the riots’ masterminds for
the last two years while simultaneously carrying out massive developments to meet
the indigenous Papuan people’s basic needs. The public should not be biased, given
that;
The Free Papua Movement is not an original movement that voices
indigenous Papuans’ needs, but an engineered activity deliberately made by
several entities with different interests.
Each of the Free Papua organizations or factions has its respective principles,
indicating other vested interests in each organization.
In the past two years, the heavily ridden antiracism movement has not been
a genuine aspiration from indigenous Papuans - but a movement engineered
to perpetuate separatists’ interests and cronies.
This book tries to explore other perspectives and straighten out the disinformations
circulating in the community about the development of the Papua issue in the last two
years to understand the Papua problem better and see the root of the problem.

Chapter 1
West Papua in
the Last Two Years
In the past two years, the turmoil in West Papua has been heating up. The
racist remarks towards Papuan students in Surabaya (August 16, 2019)
caused an uproar that spread to other provinces in Indonesia. It’s awful
in West Papua as the racism issue culminated into the bloody Wamena-
Jayapura Riots on September 23, 2019. Casualties fell, thousands of
people took to the streets, and public facilities were damaged. Does the
Indonesian government regarding West Papua as a bench player? Is it true
that indigenous Papuans are marginalized? Were the efforts to deal with the
racial conflict merely lip service? Or are there certain parties with vested
interests who deliberately escalate the situation?

Chapter 1 . Papua in the Last Two Years We Need To Talk About West Papua 7
Flashback to Racism in Indonesia and Its Solution
In this modern era, racism is still a thorny problem in Indonesia. Many Papuans
bringing up the racism issue shows that racism is still prone in Indonesia. However,
due to the separatists’ attempt to heat the issue so that negative stigma stays on,  the
conflict resolution through dialogue and peace agreement is still a big challenge.
Ironically, some parties have been using racism to create an even bigger conflict
between Papuans and non-Papuans. Moreover, Free Papua separatists also use racism
as an excuse to demand a referendum based on Melanesian racial differences. In fact,
Indonesia has 13 million Melanesians, spread as indigenous populations in three other
provinces, namely Maluku, North Maluku, and East Nusa T enggara  (NTT)1.
Racism and human rights violations that have occurred in West Papua continue to serve
as a narrative to raise the Free Papua symbol, the Morning Star flag, all over the city. The
Free Papua separatists turned a peaceful protest of anti-racism into a requisition for a
referendum. Racism cases in West Papua must be resolved on an anti-racism plane, not
on a separatism plane. Moreover, racism does not have any place under the Indonesian
national motto, namely Bhinneka Tunggal Ika (Unity in Diversity). The government has
been minimizing racism by fostering tolerance education between ethnic groups and
religious communities.
Racism is a common problem, both in the world and in Indonesia. In Indonesia, racism
does not only affect Papuans but also other minority groups. The government had
successfully resolved many racism cases properly, but not the Papuans one. With
a humanist, persuasive, and culturally appropriate approach, tolerance and mutual
respect can develop within the sphere of different ethnicities or religions. Surprisingly,
Papuan racism cases often arise and are difficult to resolve even though indigenous
Papuans themselves are people with very high tolerance. This irregularity occurs
because the existing racism cases are not organic but engineered by certain parties to
heat the Free Papua issue.

Racism in Indonesia is a manifestation of Dutch colonialism that differentiates Dutch
citizens and indigenous people’s treatment. Racism continues even though the Dutch

have left Indonesia. Since the establishment of the Indonesian New Order under the
Suharto era (1966–1998), minority groups in Indonesia have faced various forms of
racism and discrimination. The existence of this systemic racism has resulted in a lot of
racial violence in Indonesia. Many racial riots occur in areas with large transmigration
waves, as has often been the case in Kalimantan, Lampung, Aceh, or Ambon. The
conflicts mostly occur between individuals of different ethnic groups, but racist
prejudice makes these conflicts escalated into ethnic groups divisions2.
Conflicts often occur between indigenous tribes in Kalimantan, namely the Dayak tribe,
and the immigrant tribe, namely the Madura tribe. From 1996 to 1997, there were racial
riots between the Dayak and Madurese tribes in West Kalimantan. This riot occurred
because of a fight between Dayak and Madurese youths during a dangdut showcase
event. This conflict continued for approximately one year and killed approximately
200 people, including Maribas Village’s head killed by the Madurese3.
In 1999, there was a riot between Malays, Dayaks, and Madurese in West Kalimantan,
known as the Sambas Conflict. This riot occurred because the Madurese allegedly
persecuted a Malay. A total of 265 people were killed, 38 were seriously injured, and
9 were slightly injured. Also, more than 2,330 houses were burned down, and mobs
damaged 164 others4.

Chapter 1 . Papua in the Last Two Years We Need To Talk About West Papua 9
Still, in Kalimantan, another conflict between Madurese and the Dayak exploded in
2001. This conflict started in Sampit, Central Kalimantan, and spread to Palangkaraya,
even throughout Central Kalimantan. The Sampit conflict was triggered by a Dayak
death allegedly killed by a Madurese. The Dayak began to look for the perpetrators and
vent their anger by burning several houses and vehicles belonging to the Madurese.
The investigation of the Dayak people’s killings, which was considered too slow, led
to an escalation of the conflict. Angry Dayaks finally attacked Madurese homes, citing
revenge, resulting in four deaths. This is what ultimately worsens the conflict. The
killings continue to occur for revenge and disrespect from both parties. When the
conflict ended, about 500-1,300 people were dead, mostly the Madurese5.
Conflicts between Dayak and Madurese in Kalimantan have been persistent. Most of the
conflicts are ignited by small fights that escalate into riots fueled by cultural differences
between the two tribes. The Dayak despised how the Madurese would not adapt to
Dayak culture even though Madurese lived in Dayak’s land. However, these conflicts
were finally resolved after various attempts and peaceful approaches were made. The
government sought mediation between tribes to minimize misunderstandings and
foster a sense of tolerance. The government also helped facilitate a peace agreement
between the two tribes so that the riots would not recur.

In 1999, there were riots between Muslims and Christians in Ambon. This conflict
occurred because of a dispute between Muslim Bugis and Christian youths from
Mardika Village. The dispute caused the Muslim Bugis to attack Mardika Village then
the Christians Mardika retaliated. The conflict based on ethnicity, religion, race, and
inter-group had devastated the City of Ambon, Maluku. The government continued
trying to reduce the riots in Ambon. Still, due to the conflict’s escalation, which
continued without good intentions from the two warring parties, the government
gave up. When the conflict heated up, an organization called the Maluku Sovereignty
Front emerged. It was a legacy from the Republik Maluku Selatan (RMS, lit. Republic of
South Maluku) separatists group. This separatist group worsens the riots that already
happened. Many parties rode this conflict in their interest and made the riot even more
difficult to control. In the end, the inter-religious conflict in Ambon was resolved with a
peace agreement and the handover of sharp weapons and homemade bombs in 20166.
In 2012, riots occurred in Lampung between Lampung and Bali ethnics in Balinuraga
and Agom Villages. The 2012 riots were the culmination of an ongoing dispute between
the Lampungnese and Balinese. This riot started with brawls between Balinuraga
Village and Agom Village’s youth, which could have been resolved amicably. However,
due to the accumulation of previous conflicts, violence escalated between them. The
resolution finally came into place through conflict mapping, dialogues between the
conflicting communities, mediation, hearings, and making peace agreements7.

12 Chapter 1. Papua in the Last Two Years We Need To Talk About West Papua
The riots resulted from the institutionalization of racism and the neglect of the
growing issues of racism in Indonesia. The government prioritizes open dialogue,
meetings between traditional leaders, or deliberations to resolve conflicts between
tribes and religions. Although this approach can reduce the conflict, it cannot
eliminate racism deeply rooted in society.
Inter-ethnic conflicts in Indonesia show how race, ethnicity, culture, and religion are
prone to discrimination against small minorities. In the end, a peaceful agreement and
conflict resolution finally ended the tragedy. However, these people had never seen
their ethnicity difference as a motive to separate from Indonesia, or crudely said:
“to establish its own state. ” But the racism issue raised by the Papuans is a different
case. The separatists utilize racism to demand independence. For this reason, the
racism raised by separatist activists is not purely to defend the Papuans but rather
to launch a Free Papua agenda. By peaceful means, Papuan racism can be resolved
if there is no separatist agenda at work. Racism cannot be used as a basis for asking
for independence because the Unity in Diversity, which is adhered to by Indonesia,
emphasizes unity. Papua is an integral part of Indonesia and its final.
Separatists’ Effort to Ride the Racism Issue
Free Papua separatists use the racism case in West Papua to demand a referendum
from the Indonesian government. The protest happened in West Papua (August-
September 2019) after the Surabaya racism incident allegedly masterminded by the
Komite Nasional Papua Barat (KNPB, lit. West Papua National Committee) and the
United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP). Both separatists groups
allegedly utilized the students to hold a demonstration, which ended in chaos 8.
The separatists infiltrated anti-racism protests involving thousands of citizens and
students to launch their referendum agendas. Separatist organizations also continue
to provoke the masses to rise various protests demanding independence based on
alleged racial discrimination. This action certainly had many negative impacts on
Papuans. The series of violence resulted in a lot of casualties and material losses.
Free Papuan separatists organizations, such as ULMWP (United Liberation Movement
For West Papua), used the Surabaya racism incident to raise the issue to the international
scene. ULMWP also requested assistance from other Melanesian countries such
as Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and Fiji to support West Papua’s separation from
Indonesia. The separatists and their supporters urged the UN to call out Indonesia
about the racism issue and the need for a referendum.

The racism that afflicts Papuan students in Surabaya on August 16, 2019, triggered a
series of protests over racism in Indonesia. From August 19 to September 30, 2019,
Papuans in Jayapura, Sorong, and Manokwari took to the streets. They demanded
the elimination of all forms of discrimination experienced by Papuan students. This
incident also triggered the protests that were partly orchestrated by Papuan separatist
activists. The protests became momentum to demand a referendum for Papuans. The
raising of separatist flags, called the Morning Star, in several places during the protests
indicating that the movement was behind these protests.
Ralph Regenvanu from the Vanuatu Land and Justice Party has been promoting the
concept of “One People, One Soul, ” also known as the Wantok Blong Yumi Bill. Inspired
by the Vanuatu founding father Walter Lini, the Wantok Blong Yumi Bill insisted
that Vanuatu will only be fully independent should all Melanesian nations become
independent. The separatists politicized this sentiment as the main key to their political
identity as Melanesians. However, 13 million Indonesians of the Melanesian race
spread across three other provinces outside of West Papua, namely Maluku, North
Maluku, and East Nusa T enggara (NTT). Papuan separatists consider the Indonesian
government’s control of their territory a result of illegal annexation, and decisions
taken do not involve Papuan votes.
In the midst-2020, the murder of George Floyd by American police sparked the Black
Lives Matter movement. Separatists did not miss this opportunity to raise the copycat
hashtag Papuan Lives Matter to insert their separatist agenda into the anti-racism
movement. Racism cases with black people in America have a different history and
context from that of Indonesia. The Black Lives Matter started with the struggle to
abolish slavery and gain individual freedom, which later turned into a struggle for
equal rights, eliminating segregation and repression against black people. Meanwhile,
the Papuan case started with separatism and utilizing the racism issue to push for a
referendum.

Even though Indonesia is considered slow in resolving racism in the country, especially
in Papua, the government has made various efforts and approaches to reduce racism
conflicts. The Governor of East Java Khofifah Indar Parawansa apologized for the
alleged racist assault to Papuan students on August 19, 2019. She held a hearing
involving Papuan students to find solutions on the problems9.
However, separatists deliberately steer the racism issue in West Papua to separatism,
with a referendum as the only solution, which hindered the government’s effort to
resolve conflicts. In fact, the issue of racism and separatism are two different things.
Racism conflict resolution requires a humanist approach to provide and guarantee
protection for groups that experience racist acts. Meanwhile, conflict resolution for
the issue of separatism uses a political approach that relates to state sovereignty.
Protests because of racism in Surabaya, which ended in chaos, occurred because
they were ridden by separatism. The problem of racism in Surabaya can actually be
resolved well if there are no other interests behind racism. However, due to ongoing
provocations by separatist activists who tried to heat the Surabaya racism incident,
riots occurred in West Papua.

The racist incidents affecting Papuan students in Surabaya ignited a series of
protests in Papua’s major cities from August to September 2019. However, two riots
were allegedly carried out on purpose just a day before the UN General Assembly,
which was held on September 24, 2019, to re-heat the racism talk to be discussed at
the UN Session. This rioting took place in Wamena and Jayapura, where thousands
of students and Papuan people took to the streets to stage protests to interview
racists, which ended in chaos. The action, which initially aimed to prosecute racism,
had destroyed buildings, public facilities, vehicles and demanded self-determination
for the Papuan people. Many casualties fell due to this protest; as many as 33 people
consisting of civilians, security forces, and doctors. Among them, 29 non-Papuans
were burned to death, at least 66 people were injured, and 8000 people fled to police
stations, offices, government offices, and the local churches in Wamena 10. Papuan
separatist groups, namely the ULMWP and KNPB, masterminded the riot to raise the
Free Papua issue11.
Surabaya incident
The incident that triggered a wave of protests in West Papua and even in several
cities in Indonesia originated from the Papuan Student Dormitory’s siege in Surabaya
that occurred on August 16, 2019. According to the spokesperson for Front Rakyat
Indonesia untuk West Papua (FRI-WP , lit. Indonesian People’s Front for West Papua),
the siege occurred on August 16, 2019, 4 pm, carried out by security forces and several
community organizations. This siege occurred because of the alleged destruction of
the Indonesian flag by Papuan students living in the dormitory. At that time, students
who were in the dormitory were pelted and cursed at with racist remarks. On August
17, the police took 43 students to the police station to question the destruction of
the Indonesian flag12.

According to the police, the siege happened after various community organizations
report the Indonesian flag’s destruction. The mass surrounded the Papuan Student
Dormitory, then the police asked the students to leave the dormitory, but they refused.
After failing to make various persuasive efforts to expel the student, the police finally
broke in. In the early hours of the morning, 43 students were brought to the Surabaya
Police for questioning. The students were released because there was no strong
evidence that they had damaged the Indonesian flag13.
The government followed up this case and arrested two people who committed hate
speech and spreading hoaxes. Apart from that, the governor of East Java, Khofifah
Indar Parawansa, has also apologized for the racism in the Surabaya Incident. The East
Java government also took the initiative to hold a dialogue with Surabaya students to
foster mutual trust between the people of East Javanese and Papuans 14. The Mayor
of Surabaya, Tri Rismaharini, also apologized and asked fellow residents not to be
provoked and harm themselves15.
A few days after the Surabaya incident, protests emerged in 23 cities of Papua and West
Papua Provinces, 17 cities in Indonesia, and three cities abroad (August 19-September
30, 2019). The protests were part of a long series of demonstrations demanding the
elimination of racial discrimination against Papuans. The word ‘monkey’ offended
many Papuans and considered it as racist remarks against them.
But, the anti-racism protests then turned into separatism demands. As discussed
earlier, racism and separatism are two different things; we cannot confuse racism
with separatism. Separatism has political content, while racism does not. It means
that we cannot solve a racism problem with a referendum. Some of the protests that
bloomed into riots were masterminded by the separatists, indicated by how they mixed
separatism into the protests’ cause.
The separatist rode the issue of racism in Surabaya and turned it into a call for
referendum. The racism allegation which could have been resolved properly, ended up
causing major riots in Papua.

Papuan Students Exodus
Lots of Papuan scholarship students study on other islands in Indonesia. Some of them
attend college in Jakarta, Medan, Makassar, and other cities. These Papuan students
are usually under an organization, namely the Papuan Student Alliance (AMP), which
is currently a cadre organization of the KNPB separatist group. Many of AMP’s senior
students are members of the KNPB. These senior students who are free to intimidate
junior students are masterminding the exodus of Papuan students16. Not only inciting
students to return home, but these KNPB members also orchestrated anti-racism
protests that led to requests for referendums or even riots.
According to reports, more than 800 students have returned to their hometowns 17.
The return of these students is in line with the declaration of the Majelis Rakyat Papua
(MRP , lit. Papuan People’s Assembly) issued on August 23, 2019, advised Papuan
students to return and continue their studies in Papua, should there be  no guarantee
for their safety and security from the provincial government, district/city governments,
and security forces at each study city18.
These Papuan exodus students created another problem in West Papua. The regional
government found it challenging to distribute students to universities in West Papua.
Exodus is merely disrupting students’ opportunities for a better future.

Papuan students of Ikatan Mahasiswa se-Papua (Imasepa, lit. the Papuan Student
Association) held a peaceful demonstration in front of the Bandung Satay building
on August 18, 2019. Also, demonstrations in Medan took place on August 19, 2019,
involving dozens of Papuan students. Protesting students wore Morning Star clothes
and attributes, sang fighting songs about independence Papua in front of the North
Sumatra Regional House of Representatives building. The rally initially aimed at
ending discrimination against Papuan students became a demonstration demanding
a referendum. The students demanded a referendum as the most appropriate way
to end acts of racial discrimination and human rights violations against the Papuan
people. They think that the most democratic way the Indonesian government can do is
self-determination19.
Demonstrations that took place in several cities in Indonesia were a response to the
Surabaya racism incident. However, separatists utilized it and turned it into a self-
determination demand for Papua that was not even close to solving racism.

Jayapura Riots I (August 29, 2019) and Jayapura Riots II
(September 23, 2019)
Two riots took place in Jayapura, namely the Jayapura Riot I (August 29, 2019) and
Jayapura Riot II (September 23, 2019). The KNPB was behind these two bloody
tragedies20. And the second one involved the Papuan exodus students. The first
rioting took place on August 29, 2019. Thousands of Papuans in Jayapura City, Papua
Province, protested against the discrimination and violence during the siege of the
Papuan Students Dormitory in Surabaya City, East Java Province, which happened
on August 16, 2019. Protesters burned several buildings, such as the Papua People’s
Assembly office in Abepura. They also burned down a wireless telecommunications
tower belonging to PT. T elkom Indonesia in Jayapura City21. At the end of the day, the
protesters occupied the Papua Governor’s Office and replaced the Indonesian flag
on the office’s front with the Free Papua separatist flag 22. KNPB separatist activist
Steven Itlay played a role in mobilizing the masses from Sentani and conveyed the
message of the chairman of the KNPB, Agus Kossay, to all KNPB members23. Buchtar
T abuni, deputy chairman of the ULMWP , also played a role in inciting the mass during
Jayapura riots on August 29, 201924.

This riot paralyzed economic activity and shut down shops, offices, and public
facilities 25. The mob burned down office buildings, shop houses, and vehicles they were
passing by. The situation was tense; residents were scared and hiding in their homes
even though the riots had ended. This riot caused material and psychological losses for
the people of Jayapura. Four civilians were killed.
The second riot took place at Expo Waena, Jayapura City, on September 23, 2019. This
riot broke out between Papuan students and local security forces. Students took up the
Cendrawasih University (Uncen) and established a post there starting from the time
when the Papuan exodus students arrived in Papua. KNPB then provoked students to
rally in Papua cities 26. After negotiations between Papuan students, the campus, and
the authorities, they finally agreed to be transferred to the Expo with the security
forces vehicles.

Not long after that, riots broke out and clashes between students and security forces
could not be avoided. Police said a group of people suspected as KNPB attacked
officers27. The riot at the Waena Expo resulted in 3 people, suspected of being students,
killed and 20 people injured 28. A soldier died and six others were stabbed. The police
finally arrested 318 students suspected of being the riot maker29.
ULMWP and KNPB allegedly masterminded the Jayapura Riot II. They took advantage
of the Papua Student Alliance (AMP) exodus to carry out destruction and attacks on
TNI and Polri officers at the Waena Expo 30. The police have arrested Ferry Kombo,
former Chairman of the Student Executive Board (BEM, lit. Student Executive Board)
of the University of Cendrawasih, and named him a suspect in the Waena riot.  Ferry
Kombo is connected to domestic and foreign networks, namely KNPB and ULMWP .
Apart from Ferry Kombo, the police also arrested Alex Gobay, the mastermind behind
the riots, and motivated junior students to participate in the protest31. Apart from Ferry
Kombo, the police arrested Alex Gobay, who moved the junior students to protest and
then stirred into riots32.

After the exodus, Papuan students regretted doing the exodus and demonstration
in Papua33. BMany students failed to continue their studies after returning to West
Papua.  Several Papuan student representatives in Java advised fellow Papuan students
who had returned to Papua to return to the study cities and continue their studies 34.
Some Papuan exodus students even stated that they got deceived35.
Also, there was a misappropriation of funds for exodus Papuan students by the
Director of Perhimpunan Asosiasi Kebijakan dan Hak Asasi Manusia Papua (PAK-
HAM lit, the Papuan Human Rights Policy Advocacy Association), Matius Murib.
Using the exodus students’ human rights to have education as his reasoning, the
director proposed that the government send the Papuan students back to the study
cities. But instead of using it for the students, the director used the fund for himself.
Even though the government has disbursed grant funds to help return students to
Papua amounting to IDR1.6 billion, Mathius used about IDR 369 million only for the
exodus students36. This corruption is very detrimental to the state and to the students
who were promised aid funds.
Wamena Riot
On September 23, 2019, the riots in Wamena City, Jayawijaya Regency, raised
questions and speculation about the alleged intentions behind this action,
deliberately carried out by separatist activists. Why did this riot occur after the
racism case of Papuan students in Surabaya occurred a month earlier, on August 16,
2019? And why did this riot occur the day before the UN session on September 24,
2019? Was it deliberately made so it could be raised in the UN session?
The bloody Wamena tragedy was allegedly triggered by hoaxes about a teacher
making racist remarks at school on September 18, 2019. The school had mediated the
misunderstanding between the teacher and the student related to the racist remarks
and the case had also been solved amicably 37. However, residents and students in
Wamena already believed the hoax spread through the online messenger. A group of
people then attacked the related school and then the rioting spread to all corners of
Wamena38.

If not because of certain parties involvement in spreading the hoax and raising the
racist remarks again, there wouldn’t be any riot in Wamena or in Jayapura. The protest,
which was allegedly carried out by 200 Wamena students, was infiltrated by unknown
people who did not come from Wamena. But along the road to the school, the masses
kept arriving and causing chaos at several points.
Stoning, burning people’s homes and government offices could not be avoided. A
total of 33 people were killed, 53 people were injured, 530 buildings belonging to
the community were damaged and burned, 238 vehicles were damaged, and 17
government-owned buildings were burned, including the regent’s office, and the
Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN, lit. State Electricity Company) office 39. The riot also
temporarily halted activities at Wamena airport 40.
This riot resulted in 5,000 residents taking refuge in 4 refugee points. Most of the
victims who died were migrants. Some of the victims died because they were trapped
in the shophouses that were burned by the rioters 41. Many innocent civilians died
because of this riot; several eyewitnesses said that the rioters threw arrows and
machetes at migrants. When the rioting occurred, many people ran to save themselves
from the masses’ anger.
The Komisi Nasional Hak Asasi Manusia (Komnas HAM, lit. National Commission on
Human Rights) considered that the riots in Wamena were inseparable from the racism
cases experienced by Papuan students in Surabaya. Moreover, at that time, Papua’s
conditions were still susceptible to the Papuan movement’s protest in August 2019.
So that the teacher’s racist remarks became another trigger. The KNPB provoked the
protests into chaos by disguised as high school students and carrying out destruction
to the streets.

The KNPB was proven to have provoked peaceful demonstrations on August 19 and
29, 2019, and turned it destructive 42. Meanwhile, in the Wamena Riot, the KNPB was
suspected of triggering a riot to be discussed at the UN Session on September 24,
2019. This was supported by Benny Wenda’s efforts as ULMWP leader to encourage
the UN to discuss Papua’s riots. In the 74th UN Session, Benny Wenda tried to enter
the room together with Vanuatu’s delegation. However, the United Nations did not
allow him to enter due to strict regulations that only allow citizens and delegates to
enter the UN General Assembly 43. The separatist efforts to politicize racism for their
benefit caused many losses to society. The series of riots that occurred in West Papua
caused innocent people to become victims. The riots could have been avoided if the
separatists didn’t incessantly use racism to open an opportunity to demand Papuan
independence.

The Wamena-Jayapura Riots, which was instigated by the separatist group Komite
Nasional Papua Barat (KNPB, lit. West Papua National Committee) and the United
Liberation Movement of West Papua (ULMWP) just a day before the 2019 UN
General Debate 44, was a separatist step to raise the issue of racism to attract the
attention of member countries of the UN Assembly. This riot made it easier for the
Vanuatu delegation as the spearhead of Free Papua separatists to raise Papua’s issue
at the UN Session. Separatist deliberately set fire to riots in Papua the day before the
UN session took place.
The 2019 UN Session took place in New York, United States, on September 17-30,
2019. Then the UN General Debate was held September 24-27, 2019. At this UN
Session, there were delegations from the Pacific Islands, such as Vanuatu, who raised
Papua’s issue and past human rights violations that had occurred in West Papua when
the Suharto military regime was still in control of Indonesia. Indonesia anticipated
these Pacific Island countries’ predictable steps from year to year.

26 Chapter 1. Papua in the Last Two Years We Need To Talk About West Papua
Vanuatu and several other pacific countries’ involvement in discussing human rights
violations in West Papua is considered to violate state sovereignty boundaries
embedded in the UN charter. The politicization and internationalization of the West
Papua issue have provided Vanuatu’s many advantages both at home and abroad.
Vanuatu’s success in raising Papua’s UN Session issue affected domestic political
support and increased Vanuatu’s popularity in the Pacific region.
In his speech regarding West Papua, PM Vanuatu mentioned, “Human rights violations
are happening in the world today. Vanuatu strongly condemns the human rights
violations committed against the indigenous people of West Papua. We call on the
United Nations system to be used to find solutions to these human rights violations.
Therefore, the Pacific Islands Forum leaders’ resolution asked the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit the province of West Papua
to carry out an assessment, supported by concrete evidence, of the human rights
situation. Vanuatu endorses this resolution and calls on Indonesia, a neighboring
country and partner in the region, to do the right thing and act responsibly and
approve such a mission. I would like to recall the Charter of the United Nations’
principles and reaffirm our belief in fundamental human rights, the dignity and
value of the human person, and the equality of rights between men and women and
countries large and small45”
The Solomon Islands Minister of Foreign Affairs and External Trade also delivered a
message related to Papua’s human rights violations. He said, “Concerning the West
Papua issue, Solomon Islands conforms to the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF). The
Solomon Islands reaffirms Indonesian sovereignty over Papua. However, it
remains concerned about the escalation of violence and allegations of human rights
violations that continue to be reported in West Papua. Solomon Islands welcomes
Indonesia’s invitation to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit and
conduct an independent human rights assessment in West Papua. The Solomon
Islands urges both sides to agree on a date for a visit immediately to ensure that the
result is achieved as quickly as possible.46”

Apart from Vanuatu and Solomon Islands, Prime Minister Tuvalu Minute Alapati T aupo
also delivered a short speech on Papua as follows: “Likewise, the United Nations must
engage with the people of West Papua to find a lasting solution to their cause. I
want to thank and welcome Indonesia’s invitation to a mission to West Papua by
the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.47”
The three speeches delivered by delegates from representatives of Pacific forum
countries emphasized resolving human rights violations in West Papua and the UN
High Commissioner for Human Rights to come and see the current situation in West
Papua. The speech has received different responses from several parties.
The Indonesian delegation responded to the speech of the Prime Minister of Vanuatu by
emphasizing two points. First, the UN Charter teaches always to respect the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of other countries. He added that one country continues to
show support for separatist groups that have claimed innocent civilians. He calls this a
state-sponsored separatist movement, which is not justified by international law and
the UN charter.
The second point, he said, was that Indonesia needed to inform UN members to see
the motives behind the country’s statements and actions. Vanuatu wants to impress
the world about its concern for human rights issues, while its sole reason is to support
the separatist agenda. Vanuatu continues to take provocative actions, among others,
by promoting the promise of baseless self-determination. What Vanuatu didn’t realize
was that his provocation had raised hope and even sparked conflict. This is a very
irresponsible act. Vanuatu’s provocation has resulted in damage to infrastructure that
belongs to the everyday people of Indonesia. Hundreds of houses were burned. Public
facilities were destroyed. Worst of all - the lives of innocent civilians also died48.
Indonesia considers Vanuatu’s involvement in the West Papua issue, and the
discussions at the UN general session have intervened in Indonesia’s sovereignty.
Indonesia suspects that there are other motives behind it, seeing how Vanuatu has

28 Chapter 1. Papua in the Last Two Years We Need To Talk About West Papua
supported the Free West Papua issue and how all Pacific Island countries take
advantage of the West Papua issue to benefit their respective countries. In the end,
separatist groups such as ULMWP collaborated with Vanuatu to internationalize
the West Papua issue for money and power. With the ongoing campaign for an
independent West Papua, it is undeniable that they will get aid funds from those who
support their campaign.

Vanuatu and ULMWP Political Barter
Vanuatu’s efforts to raise West Papua issue to the international arena certainly
raises questions about why the small Pacific Island nation is so passionate about
fighting for the right of self-determination for the Papuan people. What is Vanuatu’s
real motives to nudge other countries’ sovereignty at the UN session, is there any
vested interest should Papua be separated from Indonesia?
After Vanuatu gained independence in 1980, its first Prime Minister Walter Lini said
that Vanuatu was not fully independent if the entire Melanesian state was independent.
This sentiment eventually led to the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) founded
by Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, and the Front de Liberation
Nationale Kanak et Socialiste (FLNKS, lit. Kanak and Socialist National Liberation
Front). The initial focus of the MSG was to fight for sovereignty for the Melanesians49.

Chapter 1 . Papua in the Last Two Years We Need To Talk About West Papua 29

(Source: jubi.co.id)
The establishment of the MSG further strengthens the involvement of Melanesian
countries in the issue of Papua. Moreover, Melanesian countries see Papuans as part
of their community. Vanuatu made Papua’s decolonization an excuse to protect Papuan
people who were supporters of independence and promote Papuan sovereignty. Pacific
Island countries have raised West Papua’s issue in various international forums such as
PIF, MSG, and even the United Nations.
In line with this, ULMWP also continues to make efforts to raise Papua’s issue globally.
ULMWP succeeded in creating a more united front and absorbing the main pro-
independence organizations, including the KNPB. In 2015, the ULMWP was made the
official observer of the MSG and made a bid for full membership50.
In the same year, Indonesia officially became a permanent MSG member after 3 years
as an official observer. The Indonesian government considers Indonesia’s membership
in the MSG very important because it represents thousands of Melanesians who
are Indonesian citizens. This, of course, has received strong resistance from several
countries and also the ULMWP .
After Indonesia entered as a permanent member, the alignments of the Pacific island
nations of the MSG were split into two. Papua New Guinea and Fiji side with Indonesia,
while Vanuatu and FLNKS continue to push for resolving the West Papua issue, and
Solomon does not show partiality.

ULMWP’s efforts to become a permanent MSG member continue to get resistance
from several member countries. However, Vanuatu continues to push for ULMWP
acceptance to become a permanent member. In June 2019, ULMWP re-applied for
permanent membership to the MSG, with Vanuatu’s full support. ULMWP strives to
become a permanent member of the MSG to get full rights like other member countries.
50 Ibid.

30 Chapter 1. Papua in the Last Two Years We Need To Talk About West Papua
Vanuatu’s support for ULMWP cannot be separated from the political party that
dominates the Vanuatu government, namely Vanua’aku Pati (VP). This political party
adheres to the principles of the Melanesian Brotherhood in its foreign policy aspects.
It is supported by the slogan “One People, One Soul, ” in which Ralph Regenvanu,
Chairman of the opposition Vanuatu party, emphasizes Melanesian unity. The focus
of advocacy on Melanesian colonies’ decolonization is the party’s main goal (Morgan,
2008 in Zahidi, 2020) 51. Vanuatu’s domestic politics also supports efforts towards
Papuan independence. This confirms Vanuatu’s support for ULMWP in raising Papuan
issues in international institutions.
According to Zahidi (2020), lobbying efforts are also being carried out by Benny
Wenda as the ULMWP representative to make Vanuatu continue to support Papuan
independence. Benny emphasized the Melanesian Brotherhood as the main reason
why Vanuatu should help West Papua. The Vanuatu government also considers that
support for the ULMWP in Papuan independence is essential in domestic politics. With
the Vanuatu principle prioritizing Melanesian brotherhood, the VP party needs votes
to continue to be elected to lead the Vanuatu government52.
Vanuatu’s support for Papuan independence is a continuation of its domestic politics,
which is then implemented in foreign policy. Sticking to the Melanesian Brotherhood
principles, Vanuatu has made the issue of Papua the main focus of its foreign policy.
Vanuatu’s efforts continue to raise West Papua issue to its advantage for Vanuatu to
become a leader in the region. International recognition of Vanuatu’s actions in the case
of human rights violations and Papuan independence will boost Vanuatu’s credibility in
the world’s eyes.

Chapter 1 . Papua in the Last Two Years We Need To Talk About West Papua 31
Vanuatu’s efforts to internationalize the West Papua issue raises additional questions
about the Vanuatu campaign’s funds and the ULMWP . Because making diplomatic trips
around the world requires a lot of money. As we all know, the Pacific Island country
is not a developed country, so that Vanuatu might use financial assistance from other
countries. Based on Mesak et al. in their article entitled Chinese Involvement in
Vanuatu and Solomon Islands, Foreign Policy Against The West Papua Issue said that
there is a relationship between China, Vanuatu, and the Solomon Islands on the issue
of Papua. Vanuatu received aid from the Chinese government in its Belt Road Initiative,
and Vanuatu used the funds to finance the Free Papua campaign53.
The article assumes that if the funding pattern is that China provides a loan to Vanuatu,
then when Vanuatu is unable to repay the debt, China asks for the rights to manage
the port, which will later become part of China’ Belt and Road Initiative 54. Then China
provided financial assistance to Vanuatu to control the port. Vanuatu then used this
financial aid provided by China to help the Free West Papua campaign together
with ULMWP . By continuing to raise the West Papua issue, Vanuatu’s popularity can
increase both domestically and globally. The Papuan conflict management provides
material benefits for Vanuatu with aid funds disbursed by the Chinese government.
What’s more, Vanuatu can also become a leading country in the Pacific region.
Meanwhile, China will also benefit if Vanuatu and other Pacific nations continue
to push for West Papua secession. It is assumed that when the Pacific country is
increasingly dependent on China, then if Papua becomes independent, China can easily
control the Pacific Islands.

32 Chapter 1. Papua in the Last Two Years We Need To Talk About West Papua
2020 UN Session
At the 75th UN session in New York on September 22-29, 2020, Vanuatu again called
out Indonesia about human rights violations in West Papua. In this year’s UN Session,
Vanuatu is the only country that still supports West Papua secession. This is because
other Pacific countries realize Vanuatu’s other interests from West Papua issue, which
makes them reduce their involvement in supporting Papuan secession efforts. In his
speech, Vanuatu Prime Minister Bob Loughman stated:
“There are a lot of human rights violations going on around us, but it seems
the world is taking a selective approach to dealing with this. In our territory,
the indigenous people of West Papua continue to experience human rights
violations. Last year, the Pacific Islands Forum respectfully asked the
Indonesian government to allow the UN Human Rights Commissioner’s Office
to visit West Papua’s province. To date, there has been little progress on this
side. Therefore, I ask the Indonesian government to answer previous requests
from Pacific Leaders55”.
Responding to the statement made by the Prime Minister of Vanuatu, diplomat
Rayyanul Sangadji exercised Indonesian Rights of Reply, stating that Vanuatu had an
excessive and unhealthy obsession with how Indonesia should govern its own country.
Vanuatu should respect the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of
other countries. On the other hand, what Vanuatu has done does not respect other
countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity and violates the UN Charter’s principles.
Sangadji also said that the President of Indonesia had previously stated that we must
take an excellent political relations approach between countries. But Vanuatu prefers
to seek enemies and sow divisions amid the ongoing economic and health crisis by
disguising their separatist advocacy as an issue of exaggerated human rights violations.
Indonesia, which comprises more than 633 ethnic groups - a diverse and multicultural
nation with thousands of ethnic groups and hundreds of local languages   spread across
more than 17,400 islands - is committed to human rights. Indonesia values   diversity,
respect, tolerance, and equal rights in the world’s third-largest democracy. Indonesia
promotes and protects human rights where every individual has the same rights under
the law. Furthermore, Indonesia has ratified an international convention on eliminating
all forms of racial discrimination, and Vanuatu has not even signed it.
The Indonesian diplomat also added, how can someone talk about indigenous peoples’
rights when he has not even signed the International Convention on Economic, Social,
and Cultural Rights as the core instrument of human rights. This raises the question
55 Statement on West Papua presented by Mr Bob Loughman, Prime Minister of the Republic of
 Vanuatu at General debate of the 75th Session of the General Assembly of the UN (New York,
 22 – 29 September 2020) [online] https://humanrightspapua.org

Chapter 1 . Papua in the Last Two Years We Need To Talk About West Papua 33
The allegation of human rights violations is a fairy tale that Vanuatu has continued to
sell and display at the UN Session for many years. Besides, separatist activists continue
to romanticize past human rights cases that no longer reflect the current situation.
In reality, many cases of human rights violations are committed by separatists. Based
on the University of Gadjah Mada team’s field research, from 2010 to 2020, 204 acts
of violence occurred in West Papua Province, of which 118 cases were committed by
the Kelompok Kriminal Bersenjata (KKB, Armed Criminal Group, armed separatists).
The number of victims of this violence reached 1,869, including 356 people who died,
mostly civilians56.
Indonesia also added that Vanuatu was not a representation of West Papua and would
never be part of Papua. Papuans are Indonesians, and we play an essential role in the
development of Indonesia and West Papua. Vanuatu does not appear to have a clear
understanding of the UN charter’s principles, which states to respect other countries’
sovereignty and territorial integrity. Indonesia will continue to defend itself from
advocacy against separatism under the guise of human rights violations. The provinces
of Papua and West Papua are parts of Indonesia that have been irrevocable since
1945. This has also been firmly supported by the United Nations and the international
community several decades ago with the UN General Assembly Resolution 2504
(XXIV).

of whether they care about the problems of indigenous peoples. More importantly,
Vanuatu has not signed and ratified the convention against torture and other inhuman
or degrading treatment or punishment. Vanuatu is better off fulfilling its responsibility
to fulfill its people’s human rights first than taking care of other countries’ problems.

34 Chapter 1. Papua in the Last Two Years We Need To Talk About West Papua
Vanuatu also delivered a speech regarding human rights violations in West Papua at
the 45th regular session of the UN Human Rights Council on 26 September 2020.
Representatives from Vanuatu delivered a speech stating:
‘Vanuatu welcomes the special rapporteur’s work for the discussion and his
latest efforts towards promotion, protection, and fulfillment of indigenous
peoples’ rights. Vanuatu knows that the high commissioner’s report for human
rights does not address violence and discrimination by indigenous peoples
in West Papua, Indonesia’s province. The indigenous peoples of West Papua
have the right to live free from racial discrimination in a dignified manner and
accordance with their culture.
Unfortunately, these rights are being violated by a new wave of violence against
West Papuans in recent weeks. A few days ago, a pastor from a local church was
killed in Intan Jaya province by an Indonesian military unit. Unfortunately, this
is not an isolated case. The world must recognize this unacceptable situation,
and the escalation of violent incidents must be condemned.
In this regard, the Human Rights Committee under the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights on September 2 this year asked the Government of
Indonesia to provide information on civil, political, and other related human
rights issues. As stated at the Pacific Leaders Forum in 2019, Vanuatu called on
Various tribes and ethnicities in Indonesia. (Source: masbidin.net)

Indonesia to fulfill its international human rights obligations and immediately
facilitate the High Commissioner for Human Rights visit to complete his report
to the council on the situation in West Papua’57
The close relationship between the West Papua separatist movement and Vanuatu
over the years has undoubtedly left many questions; how much will Vanuatu gain from
its support for separatist activists? What happened in Vanuatu’s domestic politics when
they stopped supporting it? Is this purely the support of fellow Melanesians? or are
there other vested interests? Did China’s involvement in providing financial assistance
to Vanuatu affect the Free West Papua campaign? And suppose you look at how much
support Vanuatu has given to the Free West Papua Movement. In that case, there are
indications that the Papua issue they are raising provides geopolitical benefits that
make Vanuatu a leader in the Pacific Islands region to give Vanuatu power to regulate
the surrounding archipelagic countries.

36 Chapter 1. Papua in the Last Two Years We Need To Talk About West Papua
West Papua current racism issue continues to be exploited by separatist groups
to demand a referendum and Papuan independence. The Point Surabaya racism
incident, which should have been appropriately resolved, ended up causing
significant riots in Papua. This results from racism ridden by separatism, which
makes this issue bigger and causes substantial damage. The riots that caused
casualties could be avoided if separatism interests did not hang them and if there
was no provocation from parties who had their agenda. Certain groups also used
racism to create conflicts between Indonesians and the Papuan people a day before
the UN General Assembly, which was carried out to get international attention for
what was happening in Papua. In short, racism continues to be used to create riots
in Papua for the sake of separatism by some separatist groups.
Separatist groups also use racism and human rights violations to seek international
attention and seek support from Melanesian countries for Papua’s secessionist efforts.
Accusations of human rights violations are a fairy tale that Vanuatu has continued
to sell and display at the UN Session for years. Also, separatist activists continue to
romanticize past human rights cases that no longer reflect the current situation. In
reality, many cases of human rights violations are committed by separatists. Based
on the University of Gadjah Mada team’s field research, from 2010 to 2020,  of 204
total violence cases in Papua, 118 cases were committed by the KKB, resulting in
1,869 casualties, including 356 deaths, most of whom were civilians.
The support provided by the Vanuatu state for efforts to secede Papua seems impure
to support the struggle of the Papuan people; there are several political interests
they have achieved by exploiting the West Papua issue. What’s more, Vanuatu
received funding for a campaign on the issue of West Papua. By supporting Papuan
independence, Vanuatu will gain recognition from other Melanesian countries and
eventually become a leading state in the Pacific region. The issue of Papua is used as
an effort to gain material benefits and power for Vanuatu.
Conclusion

Chapter 2 . Free Papua and Political Interests We Need To Talk About West Papua 37
Chapter 2
Free Papua and
Political Interests
The Free West Papua Movement claims to fight for the Papuans’ rights.
However, it has become common knowledge that the separatist movement
in any country is never a pure struggle and definitely hides another larger
agenda behind it. What about the Free West Papua Movement? Is it true that
this movement was born from the Papuan people’s aspirations, or are there
other interests riding on it?

38 Chapter 2. Free Papua and Political Interests We Need To Talk About West Papua
There are several organizations formed for the Free West Papua Movement, with the
slogan Free West Papua. Even though they carry the same slogan, these separatist
organizations often disagree because they have different interests. Some of these
separatist organizations are based within the country, such as the Komite Nasional
Papua Barat (KNPB, lit. West Papua National Committee), Aliansi Mahasiswa
Papua (AMP , lit. Papuan Student Alliance), and Organisasi Papua Merdeka-T entara
Pembebasan Nasional Papua Barat (OPM-TPNPB, lit. Free Papua Organization-West
Papua National Liberation Army, the armed separatists).
While several others are based abroad, such as the United Liberation Movement of
West Papua (ULMWP), West Papua National Coalition for Liberation (WPNCL), the
Federal Republic of West Papua (NFRPB, lit. Federal Republic of West Papua), and
the National Parliament of West Papua (NPWP). Domestic factions often clash with
foreign ones. They were often seen demonizing each other on social media. This is
because each faction considers itself as the best struggle and has a different sponsor.
Besides, each faction has its own version of Papuan President.
Considering all of the facts, are these separatists groups really fighting for the people’s
wishes, or are they just using the Papuan conflict for their own interests?
Domestic Separatist Organization
Three separatist supporter groups are active domestically, which are Komite Nasional
Papua Barat (KNPB, lit. West Papua National Committee), Aliansi Mahasiswa
Papua (AMP , lit. Papuan Student Alliance), and Organisasi Papua Merdeka-T entara
Pembebasan Nasional Papua Barat (OPM-TPNPB, lit. Free Papua Organization-
West Papua National Liberation Army). All the three groups have different struggle
characteristics, history of the establishment, and organization figures, yet give equally
big contribution to the struggle for the Papuan people’s independence.
 A. Free West Papua
Movement Organization

Chapter 2 . Free Papua and Political Interests We Need To Talk About West Papua 39
1. Komite Nasional Papua Barat (KNPB, lit. West Papua
    National Committee)
Several West Papua independence activists inside the country created the KNPB
to carry out the Free West Papua Campaign. In practice, the KNPB often calls for a
referendum and mobilizes the mass to protest.
The KNPB provoked the initially peaceful anti-racism protest in Jayapura on August
19 and 29, 2019, into riots. There is clear footage showing the KNPB occupied the
governor’s office of Papua and switched the Indonesian flag into the Free Papua flag
(or the Morning Star) on August 29, 20191.
The KNPB also supports various crimes committed by Organisasi Papua Merdeka-
T entara Pembebasan Nasional Papua Barat (OPM-TPNPB, lit. Free Papua
Organization-West Papua National Liberation Army, the armed separatists), such
as when the OPM-TPNPB killed security officers, killed a New Zealander at the PT
Freeport Indonesia office, or when the armed separatists opened fire on an airplane
carrying food aid for the Bintang Mountains’ Regency residents.

On the Wamena-Jayapura Riots, September 23, 2019 2, the KNPB proved to have
mobilized the mass to riot. The rioting will be used as material for the leader of
the United Liberation Movement of West Papua (ULMWP), Benny Wenda, who
attended the UN General Assembly on September 24, 2019, exactly one day after
the riots took place, to push the discussion on West Papua on the 74th session of
the UN General Assembly3.
Buchtar T abuni became the link between the twin riots in West Papua and the Free
Papua Movement abroad as T abuni had high positions in the KNPB and the ULMWP .
Until today, there are at least three KNPB members named as political prisoners by
Indonesian government:
1. Buchtar T abuni
Buchtar T abuni is the central leader of the KNPB and concurrently the
second Deputy Chairperson of the ULMWP Legislative Body. Buchtar T abuni
coordinated the Wamena-Jayapura twin riots, which caused 37 deaths,
damaged 600 public facilities, and displaced 17,000 people4.
Not only did he mobilize the masses to riot, but Buchtar T abuni also had a direct
relationship with the ULMWP leader, Benny Wenda, who attended the UN
General Assembly on September 24, 2019, exactly one day after the riots took
place on September 23, 2019. By sparking riots, Buchtar T abuni and Benny
Wenda can freely raise the Free Papua issue at the UN Session.

Steven Itlay is the Chairman of the KNPB in Mimika Regency, Papua Province.
Itlay provoked the masses to riot in Jayapura City, Papua Province, on August
29, 2019 (known as the Jayapura Riot I) 5. Itlay allegedly has connections with
Benny Wenda, ULMWP separatist group leader, who visited the United Nations
Session in New York, United States, on September 17-30, 2019.
Italy twisted the Surabaya racism incident on August 16, 2019, into a Free
Papua separatism issue, culminating in Jayapura Riot I. Rioters burned several
buildings, such as the Majelis Rakyat Papua (MRP , lit. Papua People’s Assembly)
office in Abepura. They also burned down a wireless telecommunications tower
belonging to PT. T elkom Indonesia in Jayapura City. Four people were killed, 31
offices were burned down, and the loss reached IDR 100 billion (USD 7 million).
3. Agus Kossay
Agus Kossay is the chairman of the KNPB who masterminded Jayapura Riot I
on August 29, 2019 6. Four people were killed, 31 offices were burned down,
and the loss reached IDR 100 billion (USD 7 million). A video footage showed
how the protesters occupied the Papua Governor’s Office and replaced the
Indonesian flag on the office’s front with the Free Papua separatist flag.
It is difficult to disband the KNPB because it has supporters from the Majlis Rakyat
Papua Barat (MPRB, lit. West Papua People’s Assembly), an organization formed by
the Special Autonomy Law and financed by Special Autonomy funds in West Papua
Province. Papuakini.co reported that the MRPB invited the KNPB and ULMWP
to Rapat Dengar Pendapat (RDP , lit. hearing) on Special Autonomy on October 1,

20207. The MRPB invitation to the KNPB is a strong indication that the KNPB has
the ability to interfere and influence the MRPB decision and is likely to get a part of
the Special Autonomy funds. CNN Indonesia also reported that the Merauke Police,
Papua Province, arrested 50 members of Majelis Rakyat Papua (MRP , it. Papua’s
People Assembly), the MRPB counterpart in Papua Province, who held a hearing
with separatists on November 16, 20208.
The KNPB wanting to interfere in Indonesian policies to regulate the Special
Autonomy fund’s extension is truly suspicious. As a separatist organization, the
KNPB normally focuses on raising the issue of Papuan independence. Why did the
KNPB suddenly become so interested in money matters under Special Autonomy?
Does the KNPB have any relationship with some officials who have been allegedly
corrupting Special Autonomy funds? Could it be that the corrupted Special
Autonomy funds flowed for KNPB operations?
If there is a link between the KNPB separatist group and the corrupted Special
Autonomy fund, then the Free Papua issue has taken a position in a vicious circle.
If the KNPB and corrupt officials work together to take advantage of the Special
Autonomy funds that should be for the development of Papua, then the evaluation
of the Special Autonomy fund will be difficult to do because it is overshadowed by
threats and mass mobilization of the KNPB. Meanwhile, if the Special Autonomy
fund policy does not change according to the people’s needs, then Papua people
will find it difficult to feel the impact of development. It’s a win-win situation for
the KNPB who raised the issue of Papuan independence and obtained leaked funds
from the government budget.

2. Aliansi Mahasiswa Papua (AMP, lit. Papuan Student Alliance)
Besides KNPB, there is also a student organization called Aliansi Mahasiswa Papua
(AMP , lit. Papuan Student Alliance). AMP has a similar orientation to KNPB, namely
fighting for Free Papua through a referendum. AMP’s most conspicuous activity
in public were demonstrations. Since 2013, AMP has been active in protesting
in various cities. AMP’s main task is to build activist bases among students by
strengthening the Free Papua ideology. In a way, AMP is a separatist puppet assigned
to cadre and mobilize students to expand their coverage of the Free Papua issue.
AMP also orchestrated the exodus of Papuan students. AMP influenced and
forced Papuan students who studied in various regions in Indonesia to return to
Papua by promising better education in Papua. The students were then mobilized
to create riots in Jayapura, also known as the Jayapura Riot I, on August 29, 2019 9.
Four people were killed, 31 offices were burned down, and the loss reached IDR
100 billion (USD 7 million).
AMP deliberately formed student exodus posts to coordinate students before the
riots. AMP lawyers admitted that AMP did mobilize students in Jayapura Riots I.
Two AMP members were finally included in the list of political prisoners for their
role in the Wamena-Jayapura Riots, namely:
1. Ferry Kombo
Ferry Kombo is the former Chairman of the Student Executive Board (BEM,
lit. Student Executive Board) of the University of Cendrawasih, Jayapura City,
Papua Province. Ferry Kombo allegedly mobilized the masses and rioters who
caused Jayapura Riot I (August 29, 2019) through social media.  Kombo is also
involved with domestic and foreign separatist networks, such as the AMP ,
KNPB, and ULMWP . Security forces arrested Kombo as he was about to go to
Wamena T own, Jayawijaya Regency, Papua Province. Four people were killed,
31 offices were burned down, and the loss reached IDR 100 billion (USD 7
million) on the riot10.
2. Alex Gobay
Alex Gobay was the Student President of the Jayapura University of Science
and T echnology, Papua Province. Gobay’s role was similar to Ferry Kombo.
Gobay allegedly mobilized the masses and rioters who caused Jayapura Riot I
(August 29, 2019) through social media11.

Organisasi Papua Merdeka-T entara Pembebasan Nasional Papua Barat (OPM-
TPNPB, lit. Free Papua Organization-West Papua National Liberation Army,
the armed separatists) uses military means in its struggle. On January 27, 2020,
the OPM-TPNPB stated that it was responsible for the war in Intan Jaya and six
other “Defense Command Regionals” in the Central Highlands of West Papua 12.
Meanwhile, OPM-TPNPB General Goliath T abuni claimed full responsibility for
the war that has been carried out by all TPNPB troops throughout West Papua.
Acting as the Free Papua military wing, the OPM-TPNPB often committed violence
against civilians. In 2018 - 2019, the armed separatists killed 49 civilians in Papua.
OPM-TPNPB members live in the forest and focus on violence. They don’t have
any particular job or profession.
Unemployed and unskilled, the OPM-TPNPB members can kill anyone
indiscriminately to perpetuate the conflict. Papuatribunnews.com reported that
on March 7, 2020, as many as 790 residents of T embagapura District, Mimika
Regency, Papua Province, fled because the armed separatists occupied residents’
homes, pointed weapons, and took away food. The OPM-TPNPB has been frequently
shooting at Indonesian army posts13.
OPM-TPNPB also trains child soldiers and often performs sexual violence against
women. Often engaging in violence, the Indonesian government calls the OPM-
TPNPB as Kelompok Kriminal Bersenjata (KKB, lit. armed criminal group) or
Kelompok Separatis Bersenjata (KSB, lit. armed separatists group).
Gajah Mada University research showed that 64% of West Papua violence are
related to the OPM-TPNPB armed separatist group. Many occurred in their
operational areas, such as Puncak Jaya, Mimika, and Nduga. Throughout 2020, the
OPM-TPNPB made at least five shooting cases and murder of civilians, child soldiers
training, and rape. There are indications that the OPM-TPNPB created conflict to
attract international attention.

Separatist Organizations Abroad
Apart from existing domestic organizations, some West Papuan independence
fighters have also formed organizations abroad and garnered various parties’
support. Starting from the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) countries, Australia,
the United Kingdom, and New Zealand. The internationalization of the Free West
Papua issue is considered an easy commodity for these countries and is being used
for various interests, particularly economics and politics. Among several West
Papuan separatist organizations abroad, one organization is more vocal in garnering
support than others: the United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP).
ULMWP (United Liberation Movement for West Papua)
The ULMWP is actively campaigning for Free West Papua abroad and has been
lobbying to garner support for the UN session. As explained in Chapter 1, the
ULMWP conducted many political barters with Vanuatu so that the Free Papua
issue can be raised in the UN sessions and international stage.
ULMWP was established in 2014 and functions as an umbrella organization for
several other West Papuan separatist organizations abroad, such as the Federal
Republic of West Papua (NRFPB), the West Papua National Coalition for Liberation
(WPNCL), and the National Parliament of West Papua (NPWP).
The central figure of the ULMWP is Benny Wenda, an Interpol fugitive who later
received asylum from the City of Oxford, UK, and has remained there to this
day. Moreover, several ULMWP figures also live abroad, such as Jacob Rumbiak
(Australia), Octovianus Mote, Herman Wainggai (United States), Oridek Ap, and
Raki Ap (the Netherlands).
The separatists’ activities abroad generated support from several political parties,
such as the UK Labor Party, the Australian Green Party, New Zealand Green
Party, Vanuatu Land-and-Justice Party, Fiji Social Democratic Liberal Party, and

Chapter 2 . Free Papua and Political Interests We Need To Talk About West Papua 47
the Solomon Islands Democratic Party. However, political supports always have
underlying interests. There are interests from each of the supporting parties
entrusted to this movement.
A suspicious organization named the Walking Friends was found transferring EUR
500 to the ULMWP’s bank account. Although it wasn’t big, it became an indicator that
the ULMWP might have been used for political parties and corporations’ interests.
One of the OPM-TPNPB members, Benjamin Burton, called out the ULMWP in his
Facebook account for tainting the Free Papua with foreign needs.
Also, there are rumors saying several ULMWP members have lived comfortably
abroad by selling out the Free Papua issue. Each ULMWP member benefits greatly
from the support provided by foreign political parties and corporations; and it
shows.

Disputes among Free West Papua Groups
The Free Papua movement was often claimed as the voice of the Papuan people.
However, the factions inside the movement could not agree with each other.
Some of the factions have been accusing each other of betraying the movement. If
these Free Papua factions genuinely fight for the Papuans, shouldn’t they be under
the same command? But, each group had gradually shown its real face under the
mask of Free Papua narratives instead.

48 Chapter 2. Free Papua and Political Interests We Need To Talk About West Papua
The OPM-TPNPB figure, Father Neles T ebay, firmly stated that the armed group
would never join the ULMWP . The OPM-TPNPB claimed their armed struggle as
the true struggle and that the ULMWP has been doing a fake struggle. They also
warned the ULMWP not to copy the Free Papua Constitution’s OPM version of
July 1, 1971. The armed separatists insisted that they are the only military wing
of the Free Papua Movement and that every Papuans and Free Papua factions
should recognize the 58-years-old group.
With the OPM-TPNPB as a rival, the ULMWP has created the direst scenario in Free
Papua’s history: Benny Wenda formed an army to fight the OPM-TPNPB, risking
ordinary Papuans getting caught in between. The ULMWP has been claiming a name
over the OPM-TPNPB’s armed struggle. The armed separatists called the ULMWP
living off the bloody struggle of the OPM-TPNPB and that the ULMWP members are
just a bunch of fake white-collared diplomats selling the tears of the Papuans. The
OPM-TPNPB has even threatened to shoot anyone who joined the ULMWP .
On the contrary, Benny Wenda, as the leader of ULMWP , asked the OPM-TPNPB to
admit that the ULMWP moves abroad have strengthened the support for Free West
Papua. The ULMWP leader claimed that his organization is unifying all the Free Papua
factions, denoting a higher position than the OPM-TPNPB. Wenda also believes that
the ULMWP has made the Free Papua issue recognized internationally. He even
established the West Papua Army (WPA) to rival the OPM-TPNPB.
On one occasion, the ULMWP accused the OPM-TPNPB of a fake group made by the
Indonesian army and that the armed group got money from the government. The
ULMWP insisted that the only legitimate military wing of West Papua is the newly
established WPA.

An OPM-TPNPB’s supporter called out the ULMWP as fake diplomats on Facebook.
That is just one example of the many disputes that have occurred between the Free
Papua factions. What will happen to West Papua if one of these groups reign the
region? Wouldn’t the Papuans get caught in between their quarrel, or worst between
their selfish war? Will the people of Papua ever prosper then?
Self-Claimed Presidential Declaration
December 1st is often dubbed as the Free West Papua anniversary. From year to
year, the separatists hold a protest on this particular date to attract international
attention. In 2020, the protests were held concurrently in various countries, such as
Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Not to forget, protests were also held
simultaneously in several cities in Indonesia. However, in 2020, the ULMWP leader
Benny Wenda made a unilateral declaration on Papuan independence and appointed
himself as the interim president of West Papua14. The self-declaration took other Free
Papua factions by surprise. The OPM-TPNPB armed separatists directly rejected
Benny Wenda’s declaration.

Benny Wenda is not the first to claim as the President of West Papua. Previously,
several factions had also declared their presidency. With how easy the Free Papua
factions use the Papuan President title, it is hard for the public to take them and their
struggle seriously.
The struggle for power among the Free Papua factions is not a particularly new thing.
Several separatist figures, such as Forkorus Yaboisembut, Michael Karet, and Jeffrey
Bomanak, had also declared unilateral presidency. The lack of interest in unity showed
how the Free Papua factions only care about their respective goal. It also shows how
the Free Papua issue’s internalization was made for the separatists’ gain, not for the
people.
T o attract the United Nations’ attention to pushing another referendum for West
Papua, separatists internationalized the Free Papua issue to several countries and
received considerable feedback. These separatist figures lobbying for international
support have long left Indonesia carrying the wounds they got from the second
Indonesian President Suharto’s military reign. With their past heartache still intact
in their memory, these separatists could not and would not see how West Papua has
bloomed over the last few decades under the Republic of Indonesia as a democratic
country.

Some separatists have been living in asylums and work as full-time activists for the Free
Papua Movement. If these lobbyists don’t have full-time jobs to support themselves
and their family abroad, how do they keep living comfortably, let alone have the money
for the group’s operation? Who are their sponsors? Which countries are providing for
them? What will the sponsors get if they support the Free Papua Movement?

52 Chapter 2. Free Papua and Political Interests We Need To Talk About West Papua
Cargoism in West Papua
Divisions in Papua do not only originate from political dynamics caused by a separatist
agenda but are also propped by a history of cargo cult that once flourished in Papua.
The cargo cult is a belief and is considered the religion of the Papuan people’s origin.
This is deeply ingrained in the Papuan people. They had become Christians but still
took part in ritual practices related to a cargo cult at certain times.
Cargo cultism is a religious practice that emerged in traditional pre-industrial societies
due to interactions with more technologically advanced civilizations. The cult sought
to acquire wealth (“cargo”) through magic and religious rituals and practices. Cult
members believe that the gods and their ancestors sent the wealth. Cargo cults
flourished in New Guinea and Micronesia and began after the West’s arrival in the
19th century. However, similar behavior has emerged in other parts of the world.
The most widely known period of cargo cult activity occurred among the Melanesian
islanders in the years during and after World War II. A small population of indigenous
peoples observed, often directly in front of their dwellings, the largest war ever fought
by technologically advanced nations. With the end of the war, the military abandoned
the airbases and stopped dropping cargo. In response, charismatic individuals
developed cults among remote Melanesian populations that promised to bestow on
their followers deliveries of food, arms, Jeeps, etc. The cult leaders explained that the
cargo would be gifts from their own ancestors, or other sources, as had occurred with
the outsider armies. In attempts to get cargo to fall by parachute or land in planes or
ships again, islanders imitated the same practices they had seen the military personnel
use.
The cargo cult ritual is still practiced today by offering exalted chants of praise (wor) to
those who are worshiped and offering the best of selected foods to the saints in heaven
(Manseren Manggundi). Papuans believe that Manggundi will return at critical times.
They jumped into the activity of gathering food. They danced, intending to get their
arrival, under the command of a konor (a prophet).
The cargo cult is the hope of the Papuan people for the day of liberation, peace,
prosperity, or living in prosperity without intimidation and oppression. This philosophy
has become an ideology passed down from generation to generation in a long wait,
especially with the lingering doubts the Papuan people have regarding all planning to
develop the people’s welfare.
The government’s failures in fastly improving the welfare of the people in Papua
have made cargo cult rise in Papua. This is what causes many government programs
to run aground on the way. The Papuan people’s trust in the Indonesian government
is diminishing, resulting in gaps between the Papuan people and the Indonesian

Chapter 2 . Free Papua and Political Interests We Need To Talk About West Papua 53
government. Armed separatist groups later used this philosophy to fight against
the Indonesian government, even though it became the cause of division inside the
separatist groups.

1. United Kingdom
One of the notable supporters in the United Kingdom came from politician
Alex Sobel, a member of the British Labor Party and the chairman of All-Party
Parliamentary Group (APPG) about West Papua. Sobel held a meeting with
the leader of the ULMWP , Benny Wenda, on March 23, 2019, titled West Papuan
Rebellion: Where Next?
APPG itself, in general, has been proven to receive money from foreign governments,
charities, banks, and corporations who use the forum as a platform to lobby
parliamentarians members and steer government policies. Is this one of the reasons for
the existence of the Free Papua issue? Has the Free Papua issue become a commodity
for the separatists, political parties, and corporations?

One might wonder, how much money did APPG on West Papua get from their
sponsors? There are many foreign oil mining activities in Bintuni Bay, West Papua.
There was a suspicion that the company operating in Bintuni Bay is a mining company
that lobbied parliamentarians through APPG, which is interested in exploiting
natural gas and oil in Papua. Apart from mining interests, the APPG on West Papua
might target weapons companies to sponsor them because Indonesia was the UK’s
second-largest weapon buyer in 2004. With West Papua descending to chaos, the
arms companies might sell more weapons to Indonesia.
Furthermore, on July 17, 2019, the Oxford City Council gave the Freedom of Oxford
Award to Benny Wenda15. At that time, the Mayor of Oxford, Craig Simmons from the
British Green Party, said the accolade was “well-deserved, ” and Benny Wenda was
“contributing so much both locally and internationally. ” This award received criticism
from British citizens aware that the Free Papua separatists have violated international
law by using child soldiers, as reported by the Associated Press in June 2019.
Meanwhile, a non-governmental organization (NGO) called TAPOL UK raised concerns
about separatism in Indonesia. It ranged from the Aceh separatism to the Timor Leste
case, and now the Free Papua. TAPOL itself is funded by the Sigrid Rausing Trust,
CAFOD, The Bertha Foundation, Ford Foundation, and many individual donors. TAPOL ’s
main donor is Sigrid Rausing. She’s a Swedish philanthropist, a strong politician, and
the giant British T etra Park owner’s daughter. She was involved in a tax scandal with
the Swiss Bank and HSBC and a major donor for the England and Welsh Green Party.
Not only that, but Sigrid Rausing Trust also funded the UK-based Bellingcat, a media
specializing in social media networking. The Bellingcat might not reveal the numbers,
but there were 8,244 social media posts per month on average that talked about the
Free Papua issue. What benefit does TAPOL UK, the England and Welsh Green Party,
the Bellingcat, and Sigrid Rausing get from supporting the Free Papua?

The Free Papua separatist Herman Wainggai established the West Papua Human
Rights Center (WPHRC) on March 9, 2019. Even so, how Herman Wainggai can
establish this organization was not clear. Who funded him? How is the operation
going? The WPHRC used the Black Lives Matter moment to petition at the
Whitehouse urging the United Nations to investigate the West Papua conflict on
May 21, 2020. However, the petition was closed with below 10% support.

3. Australia
It is no secret that many politicians, institutions, and individuals in Australia have
benefited from Free Papua separatism issue. Previously, these parties in Australia
were also active in supporting Timor Leste’s independence and benefiting from
the separation process. Apart from extracting oil, these Free Papuan beneficiaries
also extracted helium from Timorese waters 16. No wonder, if several politicians,
organizations, and even companies in Australia actively provide support to the
separatists for Free Papua. They argue that this support is to protect indigenous
people (indigenous Papuans), but on the other hand, Australia also has problems
with their own indigenous people, the Aborigines 17. The actions of several parties in
Australia are very contradictory to the attitudes and domestic policies of Australia
which fully support Indonesian sovereignty over Papua.  Following are the various
engagements of several politicians, organizations and companies in Australia on
the issue of Free Papua:
a. Political Parties
The Green Party of Australia has been declining in popularity. The Greens failed to
overcome bushfires in Australia and were involved in sexual harassment, bullying
problems, and antisemitism scandals. The Greens’ concern for West Papua is just an
attempt to boost the party’s electability at the domestic level.

b. Corporations
Not only political parties but corporations also have major interests in the Free Papua
issue. The Rio Tinto Group, an Anglo-Australian multinational and the world’s second-
largest metals and mining corporation, allegedly raised the Free Papua issue to divert
public attention from environmental damage done by its activity in West Papua.
c. Individuals
Support for the Free Papua issue also comes from individuals with personal
interests:
Anthony Craig established a political party called Free West Papua Party of
Australia and uses separatism as a catchphrase on social media.
Izzy Brown from Sail 4 Justice, who previously worked on the native Aborigines’
land’s justice and rights, suddenly switched to the Free Papua issue.
Lawyers Jennifer Robinson (Australian) and Veronica Koman (Indonesian)
ride on the Free Papua issue to boost their popularity and career. After both
advocates for the Free Papua, Jennifer had become a famous lawyer in London
while Veronica earned an award from the Australian Nasional Australia (ANU)
College of Law.

4. Australia is also the home for several Free Papua activists such as Lewis Prai Wellip
(OPM-TPNPB), Rex Rumakiek (ULMWP), and Jacob Rumbiak (Spokesperson of
ULMWP). Lewis Prai Wellip is the son of a former OPM separatist group leader,
Jacob Hendrik Prai. Rex Rumakiek is a member of the ULMWP executive committee
(the highest decision-making body of ULMWP after the Board Committee).

60 Chapter 2. Free Papua and Political Interests We Need To Talk About West Papua
Moreover, Australia has also ignored several protests, such as on November 28,
2019, when a protest called “Vigil for West Papua” was held in front of the Indonesian
Consulate in Sydney, Australia. A viral video shows how one of the protesters
claimed to be paid AUD 50 each time. He is also willing to burn the separatist’s flag
if he was to be paid double.
4. Netherlands
Free Papua separatists have made several protests in the Netherlands. A Free
Papua separatist based in the Netherlands, Raki Ap, once hijacked an environmental
protest #ClimateMarch in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on March 10, 2019, to call
about Free Papua. His infiltration gained a lot of sympathy and exposure to the Free
Papua issue.

5. New Zealand
In New Zealand, Free Papua supporters mostly came from the Green Party politicians
and activists, such as Maire Leadbeater, Keith Locke, Barry Coates, Marama Davidson,
Catherine Delahunty, Steffan Browning, and Jan Logie.

62 Chapter 2. Free Papua and Political Interests We Need To Talk About West Papua
Supporters of the Free Papua movement in New Zealand include Catherine Delahunty
and Marama Davidson, who held a protest at a trade fair held by the Indonesian
government in Auckland City.
In May 2017, ULMWP chairman Benny Wenda and New Zealand’s parliament
members signed the Westminster Declaration to call and support the Papuan people’s
self-determination. The Members of Parliaments consist of politicians from the Green
Party, Labor Party, and the National Party.
New Zealand’s support for Free Papua can be seen as contradictory to their domestic
policies. This is because their support for native Papuans is not in line with their policies
towards indigenous Maori. Because of that, the party may have an underlying economic
motive.
6. Pacific Countries
In Pacific countries, ULMWP conducts diplomacy with the aim of getting money.
In return, ULMWP will support certain political parties to increase their political
electability.
A. Vanuatu
The biggest supporter of the ULMWP separatist group in Vanuatu is Vanuatu Land
and Justice Party, Ralph John Regenvanu. During the 2019 Vanuatu general election,
Regenvanu was one of the candidates for the Vanuatu Prime Minister. The separatists’
leader from the ULMWP group, Benny Wenda, provided direct support for the
second meeting at Owen Hall, Port-Vila, Vanuatu. Ralph Regenvanu’s most significant
political maneuver was to raise Free Papua’s issue, which had succeeded in increasing
its popularity. Previously, in the 2016 Vanuatu Election, Regenvanu only got 6 out of
52 seats. However, with the support of ULMWP in 2019, Regenvanu’s popularity rose
and earned 1,589 votes and 8 seats.  As a form of bartering for its popularity, ULMWP
members asked for money to fund the ULMWP office in Vanuatu for 2-3 years.
At first, Ralph John Regenvanu was just an ordinary politician but after he initiated
the Wantok Blong Yumi Bill that said Vanuatu would not be fully independent until
the rest of the colonized Pacific nations, like Papua, would be politically free. With
Wantok Blong Yumi being finalized by the Parliament of Vanuatu in June 2010,
Regenvanu is free to politicize the Papua issue for his personal and political party
gain. In December 2010, Regenvanu formed the Vanuatu Land and Justice Party to
be Prime Minister candidate.

Chapter 2 . Free Papua and Political Interests We Need To Talk About West Papua 63

and separatist leader Benny Wenda in the UK. (Source: Tabloid WANI)
Wantok Blong Yumi Bill is considered as Vanuatu’s commitment to supporting
the Melanesian nation’s independence. This moral attitude would fit perfectly in
1970 - 1980 when many Melanesian states were not independent. But for today,
it is no longer relevant since all Melanesian nations are already independent. This
aspiration was derived from the political spirit of Walter Lini, Vanuatu’s founding
father, who was born in 1942 and lived in the era of Melanesian nations’ struggle for
independence.
Wantok Blong Yumi Bill is not relevant to support the Free Papua because West
Papua is already independent as an integral part of Indonesia, as proven by the
following reasons:
West Papua has never been listed on the United Nations list of Non-Self
Governing T erritories (NSGTs). In Chapter XI of the UN Charter, it is stated that
the countries included in the NSGTs list are countries/regions that do not yet
have full sovereignty to run government independently. Meanwhile, the Papuan
can run their own government guaranteed by the Special Autonomy Law.
Papuan people participate in West Papua’s regional head elections. In 2014, 2.7
million Papuans participated in the general elections. The number continues to
increase in the 2018 and 2020 regional elections, where 44 elected leaders are
indigenous Papuans.
Under the Special Autonomy Law, the Papuan government has full power to
manage government budgets independently. The region manages its own budget
spending policies according to the needs of the region, whether for education,
health, etc.
Under the Special Autonomy Law, the Majelis Rakyat Papua (MRP , lit. Papuan
People’s Assembly) was established to accommodate indigenous Papuans’
aspirations.

These facts strengthen the notion that Vanuatu’s commitment to Free Papua
through Wantok Blong Yumi Bill is no longer relevant. On the contrary, it disturbs
Indonesia’s sovereignty and possibly other Melanesian nations in the Pacific if one
day, Vanuatu decides to use the same political maneuvers for Vanuatu’s interests
and ambitions.
B. Solomon Islands
The spokesman for the ULMWP separatist group, Jacob Rumbiak, visited the
Solomon Islands and met with the chairman of the opposition Solomon Islands
Democratic Party, Hon. Matthew Cooper Wale on March 19, 2020. ULMWP tries to
win the trust of the Melanesian Spearhead Group’s state members with the hope of
becoming a permanent member of the MSG so that they can receive MSG funding
and support. Meanwhile, the Solomon Islands Democratic Party received higher
political electability by supporting the Free Papua Movement.

C. Fiji
ULMWP separatists group approached the Fiji opposition party, namely the Fiji
Social Democratic Liberal Party (SODELPA) to win the trust of the Melanesian
Spearhead Group’s state members with the hope of becoming a permanent member
of the MSG equivalent to a state so that they can receive MSG funding and support
from other countries, companies, and conglomerates.
Meanwhile for SODELPA, the support for the Free Papua issue has given the party
political popularity as an opposition party among Fiji’s constituents. Ro T eimumu
Vuikaba Kepa as the opposition leader back in 2017, also  one of the three major
tribal leaders in Fiji (that joined the confederation), reaffirming her identity as the
defender of Melanesians.

D. Papua New Guinea (PNG)
Many PNG politicians have used the Free Papua issue to improve their positions,
such as Powes Parkop (PNG National Capital District Governor) and Gary Juffa
(PNG Oro’s Governor). Given that the next general election in Papua New Guinea
will soon be held in July 2022, many officials, including Powes Parkop and Gary
Juffa, have begun rebuilding their image. The two politicians are proven to be close
to OPM-TPNPB armed separatists when Powes Parkop came to the OPM press
conference in Port Moresby on October 9, 2019. It is strongly suspected that OPM
also received money from PNG for their operational activities.

The International League of Peoples’ Struggle (ILPS) is an international organization
that seeks to coordinate anti-imperialist and democratic movements worldwide.
ILPS promotes, supports, and develops the anti-imperialist and democratic struggle
against imperialism. ILPS was established on May 2001 at Zutphen in the Netherlands,
on the occasion of its First International Assembly, which drew participation from
the representatives of mass organizations from 40 countries.
On July 1, 2020, in conjunction with the OPM-TPNPB armed separatist group’s
anniversary celebration, KNPB General Secretary Victor Yeimo posted a video featuring
himself and ILPS Chairman Len Cooper, Deputy Chairman of the Asia-Pacific Regional
ILPS Sarojeni Rengam, and ULMWP spokesman Jacob Rumbiak. Representatives from
the ILPS showed their support for the right of self-determination for Papua on the Free
Papua issue.
8. Kenya, South Africa
The ULMWP separatist office opening in Kenya is due to ULMWP chairman, Benny
Wenda, joining the Vanuatu delegation in the 9th African, Caribbean, and Pacific
(ACP) Summit on December 9-10, 2019. During the event, Benny Wenda met Daniel
Mwambonu, chairman of the Global Pan Africanism Network (GPAN). Mwambonu
then helped Wenda to open the ULMWP office in Kenya. The main objective is for
ULMWP to sell the Free Papua issue and then ask for donations from political figures
in Kenya. After that, this group could go further to ask for funds from other African
countries.

68 Chapter 2. Free Papua and Political Interests We Need To Talk About West Papua
A deeper study on the Free Papua movement told us that Papuan independence
is not the future for native Papuans, but only a form of power struggles of several
groups with their respective goals. The movement itself is not solid, and there is too
much foreign interference inside the cause. The Free Papua ignores what the people
want, but only the factions’ power struggle. KNPB, ULMWP , OPM-TPNPB armed
separatists have their respective agendas and do not have the same goal for West
Papua.
Some foreign political parties and corporations have been exploiting the Free Papua
issue, not out of their concern for the people of West Papua, but to achieve their
respective economic and political interests. In the end, the Free Papua issue existed
because of deliberate maintenance. Meanwhile, the welfare of Papuans is forgotten.
Then, if the movement doesn’t come from the people, why can’t it be suppressed?
It will take a long time to solve the Papua conflict, given the number of actors who
maintain the issue has great influence both domestically and internationally. Not to
mention that it’s getting more complicated by the day. However, this is not a reason
for Indonesia to stop defending its sovereignty and making policies that carry the
interest of native Papuans.

A. The Dualism of the West Papua
Integration
The Free Papua separatist groups have raised their version of West Papua integration
into the Republic of Indonesia abroad. In their version, Papuan separatists held on to
the independence given by the Dutch, which had broken the 1949 Dutch–Indonesian
Round T able Conference agreement. Meanwhile, according to the result of the Act of
Free Choice, West Papua was an integral part of the Republic of Indonesia.
The process of West Papua integration as part of the Republic of Indonesia is very long.
West Papua’s integration is based on historical similarities as a former Dutch colony,
just like the rest of the archipelago 1. However, due to various parties’ interests in this
integration process, Papua’s historical dualism emerged.
West Papuan integration’s history’s dualism is a big hurdle for some Papuans to accept
Indonesian governance. The improper reconciliation process then creates new human
rights problems. These two gave rise to a pro-separatist Papuan generation that
persists today.
Now, there are newer Free Papua movements, such as the United Liberation Movement
of West Papua (ULMWP), Komite Nasional Papua Barat (KNPB, lit. West Papua National
Committee), and many more. ULMWP initiated the Free West Papua Campaign (FWPC)
on social media and successfully attracted public attention. The group also got support
from a few member states of the United Nations (UN) these past years2.
Although the history records West Papua’s integration into the Republic of Indonesia
as an attempt to fight Dutch imperialism, some Papuans think differently. These people
thought that Indonesia had snatched the independence that the Dutch had given to
West Papua.

of Dutch’s East Indies, stretching from Sabang (now a city in Aceh Special Region)
to Merauke (now a city in Papua Province) 3. Therefore, when Indonesia became
independent from the Dutch, West Papua should have became independent as part of

The Netherlands recognizes Republik Indonesia Serikat (RIS, lit. the United
States of Indonesia) as an independent and sovereign country.
Recognition of sovereignty shall be carried out no later than December 30,
1949.
The West Papua issue will be held in negotiations again within one year after
the recognition of RIS sovereignty.
Between the RIS and the Dutch Assembly, there will be a bilateral relation
between the Dutch Indonesian Union headed by the King of the Netherlands.
Dutch warships will be withdrawn from Indonesia, provided that some corvettes
(small warships) will be handed over to RIS.
The Royal Netherlands Army shall withdraw as soon as possible. At the same
time, Koninklijk Nederlands Indisch Leger (KNIL; the Royal Netherlands

Treaty, or Manila Pact, was signed. It was primarily created to block further communist
gains in Southeast Asia6.
November 1957
The US Ambassador Gordon Main asked the Indonesian government to establish
a SEATO base in West Irian. However, the Indonesian government and the people
interpreted this as an attempt at another imperialism in the Republic of Indonesia’s
territory.
Meanwhile, the Central Committee (CC) of the Indonesian Communist Party distributed
a telegram containing a call for solidarity to the communists and workers worldwide
to support the Indonesian people’s struggle in liberating West Irian from the Dutch’s
imperialism7.

The Indonesian government announced a twenty-four-hour strike against all Dutch
companies (Bartlett, 1986, p.100)8.
December 2, 1957
In response to the government’s call, the workers began to hold general strikes at
Dutch-owned and Dutch-Indonesian owned mixed factories. As a result, Dutch
people in business suffered losses of more than IDR 100 million. Three days later, the
Indonesian government began closing the Dutch consulate in Indonesia. The Indonesian
government also froze all transfers of Dutch company profits abroad9.
December 1957
The New York Times magazine reported on the Dutch restlessness in Indonesia. It
was reported that the majority of Dutch people living in Indonesia did not agree with
the politics of the Dutch government in maintaining its grip on West Irian. It was also
reported that one of the Dutch businessmen considered it “unreasonable” the Dutch
government’s reckless attitude to defend the jungle of West Irian. Instead, it imposed
risk to all Dutch capital in other parts of Indonesia10.

the Indonesian Armed Forces claimed that Indonesia had the strongest air force and

December 1, 1961
The Netherlands broke the Dutch–Indonesian Round T able Conference agreement.
The Netherlands is not just staying in West Papua but is preparing steps to separate
West Papua from the Republic of Indonesia. The Netherlands forms the Papua National
Council and unilaterally declares West Papua independence14.
December 19, 1961
The Dutch move to form the West Papua State made Indonesia very angry. At
Yogyakarta’s North Square, President Sukarno announced the Tri Komando Rakyat
(Trikora, lit. People’s Triple Command) containing:
Thwart the formation of the puppet state of Papua made in the Netherlands.
Raise the Indonesian flag in West Irian (now West Papua), Indonesia’s homeland.
Get ready for general mobilization to defend the independence and unity of the
homeland and nation15.
The confrontation between Indonesia and the Netherlands could not be avoided.
Trikora’s operational command was called Komando Mandala Pembebasan Irian
Barat (the Mandala Command for the Liberation of West Irian) with Major-General
Suharto (the future President of Indonesia) serving as its commander. In preparation for
the planned invasion, the Mandala command began making land, air, and sea incursions
into West Irian. As a result, Indonesia began a policy of confronting the Dutch over
control of Western New Guinea.

Sukarno also embarked on a policy of “progressive mobilization” to prepare the nation
to carry out his commands.
Strategies developed by the Commander of Mandala to carry out these instructions
included:
Infiltration (until the end 1962), namely by deploying infantry units around certain
targets to create a strong de facto free area that is resistant to destruction by the
enemy and to develop territorial control by unifying the local populace.
Exploitation (early 1963), namely carrying out an open attack on the enemy
military host and occupying all important enemy defense posts.
Consolidation (early 1964), namely by demonstrating the power and absolute
sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia throughout West Irian
Barat.
Implementation Indonesia runs the infiltration stage,
then carries out the Jayawijaya operation. However,
before this stage could occur on August 18, 1962, the
President ordered a ceasefire.
Although the physical confrontation did not occur,
President Sukarno’s support from Asian-African
countries, even to the Soviet Union, supported
Indonesia with war equipment, namely 24 Tu-16
bombers and a group of MiG-19 and MiG-17 fighters,
has worried the United States.
The United States is concerned that the Papua
problem could lead to the Third World War. With
British assistance, the United States facilitated the
Indonesian-Dutch negotiations that resulted in the
1962 New York Agreement (NYA)16.
Jan Herman van Roijen and C.W.A. Schurmann, representing the Netherlands, signed
the New York Agreement, at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City, United
States, on August 15, 1962.
The agreement contents include a road map for dispute resolution over the Papua/
West Irian region. Five days later (September 20, 1962), there was an exchange of
ratification instruments between Indonesia and the Netherlands, but the exchange did
not automatically take effect because the UN was involved.

So, the UN also brought this New York Agreement to the UN forum, which was later
accepted and confirmed by UN General Assembly Resolution Number 1752, which
only came into effect on September 21, 1962.
T o avoid the Netherlands losing face, the New York Agreement negotiations regulate
the transfer of power from the Netherlands over Papua land to be carried out indirectly.
The Netherlands handed it over to the UN. Only then did the UN hand it over to the
Indonesian government through the referendum or Penentuan Pendapat Rakyat
(PEPERA, lit. the Act of Free Choice).
October 1, 1962
The Deputy Governor-General of the Netherlands, H. Veldkamp, handed over West
Papua to a United Nations agency specially formed to deal with the Papua issue, the
United Nations T emporary Executive Authority (UNTEA)17.
May 1, 1963
UNTEA handed over the administration of western Papua to Indonesia. Hollandia,
which was once the center of Dutch power in West Papua, was renamed Kota Baru.
The momentum of May 1 has been commemorated as Papua’s Day of Integration into
Indonesia18.

May 4, 1963
President Sukarno came to West Papua. In front of thousands of Papuans in Kota Baru,
President Sukarno relayed his speech:
“West Irian, since August 17, 1945 has been a part of the Republic of Indonesia.
Some people might say, annex West Irian into our Motherland’s territory.
Wrong! No! West Irian has been a long a part of the territory of the Republic of
Indonesia…” (excerpt of Soekarno’s speech in Kota Baru, Jayapura, May 4, 1963)
September 5, 1963
Western part of Papua was declared as a “quarantine area” . Indonesian government
dismissed Nieuw Guinea Raad (New Guinea Council) and prohibited the Papuan flag
and national anthem. Organisasi Papua Merdeka (OPM, lit. Free Papua Organization)
opposed the decision19.
The referendum preparation process took seven years. In 1969, Penentuan Pendapat
Rakyat (PEPERA, lit. the Act of Free Choice) was held in the presence of two UN envoys.
West Papua was finally reaffirmed as part of the Republic of Indonesia and became the
26th province of Indonesia under the name of Irian Jaya.
The result of PEPERA was tested on the UN General Assembly and passed with the
adoption of UN General Assembly Resolution 2504 on October 19, 196920.
After West Papua got united with Indonesia as Irian Jaya, Indonesia took these
following steps:
West Papua has become the territory of the Republic of Indonesia since August
17, 1945, that was controlled by the Dutch
The Dutch promised to hand over West Papua to Indonesia in the Round T able
Conference
The unification of West Papua with Indonesia is an act of reclaiming the Dutch-
controlled area of Indonesia
The integration of West Papua with Indonesia was the will of Papuan people.

Chapter 3. West Papua Integration to the Republic of IndonesiaWe Need To Talk About West Papua 81
The attempt to liberate West Papua is a major effort to transfer the Dutch colonists’
territory to Indonesian rule. In the Dutch–Indonesian Round T able Conference
agreement on November 2, 1949, the Netherlands agreed to recognize Indonesian
sovereignty and surrender all Indonesian territory to the legal government, but West
Papua one year later. The Netherlands insisted that the people of West Papua have
racial and cultural differences from other Indonesians.
However, the Indonesian government saw the Dutch efforts to defend West Papua as
another attempt to take over West Papua’s natural resources. In the journal “Poverty
and Papua Conflict amid Abundant Resources” written by Sri Yanuarti, a Dutch
geologist named J. J. Dozy made an expedition to the Central Mountains, Papua, to
search for petroleum. At that time, Dozy found a hill in the shape of a tooth with a
height of 131 meters rich in copper. Dozy then took samples of the soil to test at the
University of Leiden, The Netherlands.
Meanwhile, President Sukarno was passionate about eliminating all forms of colonialism
in the world. For Sukarno, the effort to return West Papua as part of Indonesia was
an attempt to liberate West Papua from Dutch colonialism. As part of his political
move to further eradicate colonialism, Sukarno and India’s prime minister Jawaharlal
Nehru tried to build a non-aligned movement that would win the support of the newly
emerging nations of Asia and Africa. T o realize it, the first large-scale Asian–African or
Afro–Asian Conference—also known as the Konferensi Asia-Afrika (KAA, lit. Bandung
Conference)—took place on April 18-24, 1955, in Bandung, Indonesia.
As reported in CNN Indonesia on April 19, 2015, in the 60th anniversary of KAA, CNN
quoted an excerpt of Soekarno’s speech, “Let’s make a new Asia and a new Africa,
all of us, I believe, are united by things more important than things that seem to
separate us. We are united, for example, by the same attitude of despising colonialism
in whatever form it appears. And we are united when it comes to hating racism.
And we are united because of the same determination in the effort to maintain and
strengthen world peace.”
The KAA was an important step towards the eventual creation of the Non-Aligned
Movement. A 10-point “declaration on promotion of world peace and cooperation” ,
called Dasasila Bandung (Bandung’s T en Points Agreement), incorporating the
principles of the United Nations Charter was adopted unanimously as item G in the
final communiqué of the conference: (1) Respect for fundamental human rights and
C. Dutch Puppet States

for the purposes and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, (2) Respect
for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations, (3) Recognition of the
equality of all races and of the equality of all nations large and small, (4) Abstention
from intervention or interference in the internal affairs of another country, (5) Respect
for the right of each nation to defend itself singly or collectively, in conformity with
the Charter of the United Nations, (6) Abstention from the use of arrangements of
collective defense to serve the particular interests of any of the big powers, abstention
by any country from exerting pressures on other countries, (7) Refraining from acts
or threats of aggression or the use of force against the territorial integrity or political
independence of any country, (8) Settlement of all international disputes by peaceful
means, such as negotiation, conciliation, arbitration or judicial settlement as well as
other peaceful means of the parties’ own choice, in conformity with the Charter of the
United Nations, (9) Promotion of mutual interests and cooperation, and (10) Respect
for justice and international obligation21.
Indonesia’s independence resulted from the end of World War II, which led to the
Eastern Bloc defeat. However, the influence of Eastern and Western blocs after
World War II was still tremendous. Papua’s issue is a matter for indigenous Papuans
with Indonesia and a narrative built by the Eastern and Western blocs who also want
West Papua. In the book “Indonesia Against America, Cold War Conflict 1953-1963”
(Wardaya, B. 2008. p.112), Indonesia has a strategic and important position for the
Western bloc. Indonesia is an archipelago country with a very strategic geographic

position between the Pacific Ocean, the Indonesian Ocean, the Asian Continent, and
the Australian Continent. Indonesia also has 80 million people with abundant natural
wealth. If Indonesia falls into the Eastern Bloc, the security of the Western Bloc
countries will be threatened.
This statement is per historical conditions in November 1957 where US Ambassador
Gordon Main requested the Indonesian government’s approval to establish a SEATO
(Southeast Asia Treaty Organization) base in West Irian (now West Papua). The
SEATO was the Southeast-Asian version of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO). Each state member’s military strength will be coordinated to provide a
collective anti-communist shield to Southeast Asia. However, the government and
the Indonesian people interpreted this as an attempt for imperialism in Indonesian
territory. Meanwhile, the Central Committee (CC) of the Indonesian Communist Party
distributed a telegram containing a call for solidarity to the communists and workers
worldwide to support the struggle of the Indonesian people in liberating West Irian
from the grip of Dutch imperialism.
The New York Times magazine reported that the majority of Dutch people living in
Indonesia did not agree with the politics of the Dutch government in maintaining its
grip on West Irian. It was also reported that one of the Dutch businessmen considered
it “unreasonable” the Dutch government’s reckless attitude to defend West Irian.
Instead, it imposed risk to all Dutch capital in other parts of Indonesia.
The West Papua dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands ceased to improve
with how the Netherlands broke the Dutch–Indonesian Round T able Conference
agreement. The Netherlands is not just staying in West Papua but is preparing steps
to separate West Papua from the Republic of Indonesia. The Netherlands forms the
Papua National Council and unilaterally declares West Papua independence. The
Dutch move to form the West Papua State made Indonesia very angry. At Yogyakarta’s
North Square, President Sukarno announced the Tri Komando Rakyat (Trikora, lit.
People’s Triple Command) containing: 1) Thwart the formation of the puppet state of
Papua made in the Netherlands, 2) Raise the Indonesian flag in West Irian (now West
Papua), Indonesia’s homeland, 3) Get ready for general mobilization to defend the
independence and unity of the homeland and nation.
Indonesia’s anger against the Dutch reflected the previous Dutch political move,
namely the divide and conquer strategy. The Dutch once tried to break Indonesia’s
unity by giving independence to several parts of Indonesia unilaterally. Some of the
puppet states include:
The Indonesian government’s fear of this Dutch move was based on the political
move devide et impera, which had been in use by the Dutch in Indonesia before. The
Netherlands gave independence to several parts of Indonesia and made them a puppet
state for the Netherlands. Here are the Dutch puppet states in Indonesia:

84 Chapter 3. West Papua Integration to the Republic of Indonesia We Need To Talk About West Papua
1. Negara Indonesia Timur (State of East Indonesia), (1946-1950)
The State of East Indonesia was the first puppet state formed by the Netherlands.
This formation was based on the Malino Conference and the Denpasar
Conference. The territory of the State of East Indonesia includes the regions
of Sulawesi, Small Sunda (Nusa T enggara), and the Maluku Islands. The State of
East Indonesia was officially inaugurated in December 1946 with a president
named Tjokorda Gde Raka Soekawati.
2. Negara Sumatra Timur (State of East Sumatra), (1947-1950)
The State of East Sumatra was a puppet state formed by the Dutch to protect
oil fields, rubber and tobacco plantations. If the Netherlands wanted to colonize
again, they would need a lot of funds. That is why the Netherlands tried as much
as possible to influence the aristocracy and the wealthy population of East
Sumatra to form a new country. Finally, after negotiations, an East Sumatra
State was formed with T engku Mansur as its president.
3. Negara Sumatra Selatan (State of South Sumatra), (1948-1950)
On July 21, 1947, the Dutch army launched an all-round attack in South
Sumatra. This attack was named the 1st Military Aggression which resulted in
the collapse of many areas. As a result of this aggression, many areas in South
Sumatra were controlled by the Dutch until a puppet state called the State of
South Sumatra was formed with Abdul Malik as president.
4. Negara Jawa Timur (State of East Java), (1948-1950)
The formation of the State of East Java is the long aftermath of the Battle of
Surabaya on November 10, 1945. Finally, a puppet state called the State of East
Java was formed with a leader named R. T. P . Achmad Kusumonegoro.

Chapter 3. West Papua Integration to the Republic of IndonesiaWe Need To Talk About West Papua 85
5. Negara Pasundan (State of Pasundan), (1949-1950)
Different from other puppet countries, the State of Pasundan was formed
politically to defend Indonesia. The Netherlands did form it, even providing
facilities for the election of the State of Pasundan. At that time, Wiranataskusuma
was a pro-republic figure, so his victory over Pasundan was a victory for
Indonesia. Wiranatakusumah insisted on becoming president of the State of
Pasundan so that West Java would remain part of Indonesia.
6. Negara Madura (State of Madura), (1948-1950)
The state of Madura was formed by the Dutch on the orders of Van der Plas.
This state was merely a fabrication to ease the conquest of the East Java region.
The territory of this country included Madura Island and also the small islands
around it. The State of Madura was formed through false voting as the Dutch
intimidated all parties. Finally, on February 20, 1949, the State of Madura was
formed with R. A. A. Tjakraningrat as its leader.
Puppet states’ formation made using the devide et impera politics became the Dutch
strategy’s mainstay in facing the Indonesian struggle for independence. This was the
main base for President Soekarno to act decisively and finally chose the path of physical
confrontation to liberate West Papua. Although no physical confrontation occurred,
the United States worried about how Indonesia gained support from Asian-African
countries. The Soviet Union supported Indonesia by providing war equipment, namely
24 Tu-16 bombers’ air crafts that the West feared much and a group of MiG-19 and
MiG-17 fighter aircraft. The US was worried that the West Papua problem could lead
to World War III. So with British assistance, the US facilitated the Indonesia-Dutch
negotiations, resulting in the New York Agreement in 1962. Then, on August 18, 1962,
Sukarno ordered the Mandala Operation in West Papua to stop. With the non-aligned
political strategy, Soekarno succeeded in bringing West Papua to the negotiation stage
of the New York Agreement.
After that, Indonesia experienced a national political stability shock, facing several
rebellions in 1963-1967 and resulted in a change of state leader. On March 7, 1967, the
Provisional People’s Consultative Assembly (MPRS) held a special session. It produced
26 decrees to remove President Sukarno from the government and appoint Suharto
as the official President until the election was held. Since then, President Soeharto
continued to resolve the West Papua dispute until the PEPERA result was tested at
the UN General Assembly and passed as the adoption of the UN General Assembly
Resolution No. 2504 dated October 19, 1969. West Papua officially became a part of
the Republic of Indonesia.

D. Conclusion
The Netherlands gave West Papua fake independence by breaking the Dutch-
Indonesia Round T able agreement. The Free Papua separatists should not exaggerate
a historical flaw that occurred because of the Dutch selfish unilateral steps to control
the natural wealth of West Papua. The Netherlands entices the Papuan people with
independence in the same way as the Netherlands does with other puppet states
in Indonesia. West Papua is legally an integral part of Indonesia. Even the United
Nations acknowledges it.

The second President of Indonesia, Suharto (1967-1998), who reigned with a
militaristic regime, has caused Papuans’ deep wounds. The Free Papua separatists
have been exploiting these old wounds to separate themselves from Indonesia.
However, human rights cases that happened under President Suharto and the
narrative that the Papuans did not advance are no longer relevant today. The people
of Papua currently live in a modern way, are free to live their lives to the fullest,
take any job they want, and pursue higher education. Even several presidents after
Suharto have forged a special bond with Papuans. Indonesian presidents, such as
Bacharuddin Jusuf (B. J.) Habibie, Abdurrahman Wahid, and Joko Widodo, have been
sincerely trying to meet all the Papuan people’s needs with a humanist approach.
Furthermore, one president’s mistake cannot be claimed absolutely as the country’s
fault, especially if the erring president had stepped down and replaced newer presidents
who make better policies. Therefore, bringing up Indonesia’s mistakes in the past to
perpetuate Free Papua separatism is irrelevant. From a more positive and objective
point of view, each president has a unique policy of elevating West Papua as an integral
part of Indonesia. One of them is Otonomi Khusus (Otsus, lit. Special Autonomy) policy
for Papua and West Papua Provinces so that indigenous Papuans have wider authority
to manage their own regions. Special Autonomy is projected to bring social justice and
welfare to, by, and for Papuans.
West Papua in President Sukarno’s Era
Sukarno was an Indonesian politician who was the first president of Indonesia,
serving from 1945 to 1967. Sukarno’s biggest contribution to West Papua was to
release West Papua from the scenario of a Dutch puppet state. Many literatures state
that the Dutch tried to maintain their control over West Papua because the Dutch
knew there were gold mines under its soil. The Dutch, which embraced imperialism
and pursued gold, gospel, and glory, bravely violated the 1949 New York Agreement
and unilaterally gave West Papua independence in 1961 even though West Papua
was supposed to be an integral part of Indonesia.  Sukarno immediately realized
the Dutch strategy of turning West Papua into a puppet state. During Indonesia’s
independence in 1945, the Dutch also used the same divisive tactic of forming many
puppet states to prevent Indonesian independence. At that time, the Dutch formed

Through Several Presidency Periods

Responding to the Dutch’s arbitrary attitude, on December 19, 1961, Sukarno declared
the Tri Komando Rakyat (Trikora, lit. People’s Triple Command) which contained 1)
Prevent the forming of the West Papua puppet state by the Dutch, 2) Raise Indonesian
flag in West Irian (currently West Papua) and 3) Prepare for general mobilization. In
previous years, Sukarno also made efforts to nationalize Dutch companies in Indonesia
by issuing Law Number 86 of 1958 concerning Dutch companies’ nationalization.
The companies in question include plantation companies, Nederlandsche Handel-
Maatschappij (NHM, lit. the Netherlands Trading Society), electricity companies,
petroleum companies, and the Centrale Burgerlijke Ziekeninrichting (CBZ, lit.
Central Civil Hospital) becomes Rumah Sakit Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo (Dr. Cipto
Mangunkusumo Hospital).
Madura State, Pasundan State, East Java State, East
Sumatra State, South Sumatra State, and East Indonesia
State.
Anti-colonialism became Sukarno’s source of motivation to
expel the Dutch from West Papua. The Dutch have promised
to hand over West Papua during the 1949 New York
Agreement. However, the Dutch showed uncooperative
actions and actually objected to releasing West Papua. On
December 1, 1961, the Dutch formed the Nieuw Guinea
Raad (New Guinea Council) and declared independence by
giving the Morning Star flag and the national anthem “Hai
T anahku Papua” (lit. Oh My Land Papua).
A Dutch woman was sewing the Morning Star flag in October 1961, before it was first used on December 1, 1961.

Sukarno considered that the Dutch were colonizers in West Papua, just as the Dutch
colonized Indonesia. So, in West Papua, Sukarno was motivated by political interests
rather than natural wealth, as he did not want colonialism to occur in West Papua.
Sukarno’s struggle and persistence in expelling
the colony also reached the international level.
JF Kennedy, the President of the United States
at that time, also supported Sukarno’s struggle 1,
which showed different interests between the US
Company Rockefeller and Kennedy in Indonesia
and caused Kennedy’s death. But in the end,
Sukarno’s struggle paid off as he continued to fight
for Indonesia’s claim over West Papua territory
and mobilized support from developing countries
which were currently supporting international
decolonization. The Dutch then handed over West
Papua to the United Nations T emporary Executive
Authority (UNTEA) through the 1962 New York
Agreement2. This agreement also stipulates that
the people of West Irian will exercise their right
via a referendum named Penentuan Pendapat Rakyat (PEPERA, lit. the Act of Free
Choice) to join Indonesia or not before December 1969.

Sukarno’s focus in West Papua was for sovereignty from the Dutch, both through
diplomacy and confrontation. Consequently, development-related programs in West

Papua were still not on Indonesia’s priority agenda. In its development, history was
again played by the Dutch. Sukarno’s efforts to prevent the formation of the West
Papua puppet state were twisted as a form of Indonesian colonization and the seizing
of Papuan independence granted by the Dutch.
This historical dualism is still an obstacle to some Papuans today. This is one reason
they find it difficult to accept West Papua as an integral part of Indonesia.
West Papua in President Suharto’s Era
Suharto was an Indonesian politician and military general who served as the second
president of Indonesia, holding the office for 31 years, from Sukarno’s ousting in 1967
until his resignation in 1998. The relationship between West Papua and Suharto was
awful, as Suharto’s era was also the forerunner of the growing embryo of separatism
in West Papua. Separatists fighters were irritated by some of Suharto’s military
operations and guerrillas against the Indonesian government. President Suharto did
these actions during his reign:
Signing the Freeport work contract exactly three months after Suharto was
appointed president of the Republic of Indonesia;
Establishing the status of West Papua as a Military Operation Area;
Conducted several military operations including Operation Bharatayudha and
Operation Pamungkas;
Put pressure on the Papuans when the Act of Free Choice (PEPERA) is
implemented;
Limiting the movement of the mass media.

West Papua in President B. J. Habibie’s Era
Bacharuddin Jusuf (B. J.) Habibie was an Indonesian engineer and politician who was
the third president of Indonesia from 1998 to 1999. President B. J. Habibie endured
difficult times, fixed the bad relations from the previous presidential term, and
undertook a lot of homework. Habibie is more democratic, some of Habibie’s policies
are completely inversely proportional to Suharto’s, of course, this is a significant leap
for the progress of the West Papua-Indonesia conflict. Here are some of Habibie’s
democratic policies that have succeeded in opening the door of the West Papua-
Indonesia dialogue:
Abolishing the status of Military Operations Areas to become
vulnerable areas;
Opening an informal dialogue with 100 Papuan
representatives or representatives of Foreri;
Issued Law Number 40 of 1999 concerning the Press. This
law provides freedom and rights for the press which were
previously restricted during the Suharto era.

West Papua in President Abdurrahman Wahid’s Era
Abdurrahman Wahid, colloquially known as Gus Dur, was an Indonesian Muslim
religious and political leader who served as the fourth president of Indonesia from
1999 to 2001. Continuing the dialogical efforts pioneered by President B. J. Habibie,
Gus Dur has managed to forge an excellent relationship with West Papua. In fact,
Papuan people loved Gus Dur. Gus Dur changed the name Irian Jaya to Papua and
even allowed the raising of the Morning Star flag, on condition that it is raised lower
than the Indonesian flag. He considers the Morning Star as a cultural symbol of the
Papuan people, not a symbol of nationalism.
Some of Gus Dur’s policies that have succeeded in reducing the West
Papua conflict are:
Visited West Papua two months after being appointed
president;
Allowed the raise Morning Star flag but lower than the
Indonesian flag;
Allowing and providing assistance of around 1 billion rupiah
for the implementation of the Kongres Rakyat Papua (KRP ,
lit. Papuan People’s Congress);
Initiated the Special Autonomy initiation during KRP II
in response to Papuans wish of referendum. In fact, the
initiation of Special Autonomy came from influential
Papuan representatives such as academics.
The people of Papua enthusiastically greeted Gus Dur during his first visit to West Papua on December 31, 1999.

West Papua in President Megawati Sukarnoputri’s Era
Megawati Sukarnoputri is an Indonesian politician who served as the fifth president
of Indonesia from 2001 to 2004, also the first President Sukarno’s daughter. On
November 21, 2001, President Megawati passed Law Number 21 of 2001 concerning
Special Autonomy for Papua Province. Also, President Megawati also issued several
other policies for West Papua, including:
The division of the West Papua region into three new provinces. Although the
law on regional expansion was postponed, it became the main foothold for the
next leadership;
Although she did not lead long, Megawati passed Law Number 21 of 2001
concerning Special Autonomy for Papua Province on November 21, 2001;
Special Autonomy policies during the Megawati presidency
was the first milestone of development for West Papua.
However, unfortunately, during the Megawati era, there
were also repressive actions that caused controversy.
Papuans again feel that there are restrictions on
freedom of expression and repressive actions towards
the independence movement. On November 11, 2001,
Komando Pasukan Khusus (Kopassus, lit. Special Forces
Command) killed Theys Eluay, chairman of Presidium
Dewan Papua (PDP , lit.  Papua Presidium Council).
This incident left a deep mark on the Papuan people.

Era
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, commonly referred to by his initials SBY, is an Indonesian
politician and retired Army general who served as the sixth president of Indonesia
from 2004 to 2014. One of SBY’s contributions to West Papua is the Majelis Rakyat
Papua (MRP , lit. Papuan People’s Council) in 2004 as mandated by the Special
Autonomy Law, which had been delayed in previous years. West Papua is the only
province in Indonesia with the MRP as a cultural representation of the indigenous
Papuan people. Apart from that, SBY also issued several other policies:
The division of the West Papua region into three new provinces. Although the
law on regional expansion was postponed, it became the main foothold for the

Sentani airport development in Jayapura with a status of 80%;
Construction of the Jayapura fiber optic backbone network, which is already
running, is around 60 %;
The construction of the Trans-Papua and West Papua roads at a cost of Rp. 11.3

already built.
West Papua in President Joko Widodo’s
Era
Joko Widodo is also known as Jokowi, an Indonesian politician
and businessman who is the 7th and current Indonesian
president. President Jokowi has been making drastic progress
in West Papua development as he accelerated infrastructure
development in West Papua through the vice president and
his ministers directly. Jokowi understands that the old
wounds of human rights will not be erased quickly.
T o treat old wounds, Jokowi puts every measure and
takes firm action against those who caused West
Papua problems.

Jokowi’s first visit after his second inauguration as president (October 20, 2019) was
to West Papua (October 27, 2019), which implied how he put West Papua as his utmost
priority. Jokowi proved his seriousness in advancing Papua with real work.
Currently, the Papuan people can experience the benefits of development directly.
Some of the strategic steps taken by Jokowi in West Papua are as follows:
Massive and evenly distributed infrastructure development at the national,
provincial, regional and inland scales;
Human development through education and empowerment;
Energy distribution program through one price fuel and distribution of Lampu
T enaga Surya Hemat Energi (LTSHE, lit. Energy Saving Solar Lights);
Bangga Papua (lit. Proud Papua) Program a.k.a Bangun Generasi dan Keluarga
Papua Sejahtera (lit. Build a Generation and a Prosperous Family) to create quality
human resources through improving children’s nutrition and health;
Presidential Instruction Number 9 of 2020 concerning the Acceleration of
Welfare Development in both Papua and West Papua Provinces.
President Jokowi has succeeded in continuing the development relay, a major concern
since the previous presidency era. Jokowi has succeeded in connecting one region to
another and opening up areas that have been isolated and difficult to reach. One of
his achievements is connecting and unifying roads between regions, which has been
a development policy in West Papua for decades. Although the programs are still in
progress, Papuan can already feel the results.
President Jokowi is also the only president who has made the most working visits to
West Papua. Since taking office from 2014 to 2019, President Jokowi has visited West
Papua 12 times. Jokowi has never made such many working visits in other regions in
Indonesia. Jokowi has been giving special attention that the government wants to give
to West Papua’s progress both through its infrastructure and its people.

1. Infrastructure based development
President Jokowi’s intensive visit is in line with the massive infrastructure
development program in West Papua. Under his leadership, Jokowi completes
several major projects successfully. Jokowi’s several major achievements during his
leadership are summarized in various sources, including the bridge infrastructure,
the Youtefa Bridge, which has become the newest icon of Papua Province.
Furthermore, Jokowi also largely completed the construction of Trans-Papua road
with a total length of 4,330 km.
President Jokowi has also built sea and air toll roads to reduce the price gap between
western and eastern Indonesia. Papua now has five active seaports, such as Nabire
Port, Pomako Port, Depapre Port, Moor Port, Kaimana Port, and Serui Port. T o reach
remote areas, President Jokowi built an air highway. There are 40 airports and 15
seaports in Papua and West Papua provinces connecting urban and inland areas.

2. Human Based Development
Not only in infrastructure, but Jokowi also pays more attention to human-based
development. As stated by former Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the main key to
development in West Papua lies in human resources4.
The large amount of Special Autonomy funds allocated for education provides
Papuan children with the opportunity to study in various fields. Domestically, more
than 400 Papuan children receive scholarships to get education from undergraduate
to doctoral degrees. Meanwhile, abroad, as many as 662 Papuan children have
attended 17 well-known universities5. The government pays more attention to the
education sector, especially in remote areas. One of these efforts is reflected in
the construction of 1,191 New School Units and the rehabilitation of 67,253 study
rooms in the Bintang Mountains District 6. Jokowi’s increased attention to human
resource development in West Papua shows tangible results and is right on target.
Many Papuan children who already have bachelor’s degrees and are involved in
various fields, even entrepreneurs, business people, are starting to spread among
the indigenous Papuan people.
Moreover, 21 indigenous Papuan youths who founded PT Papua Muda Inspiratif are
working together with the government to improve education and human resources
in West Papua. This collaboration aims to develop the Papua Youth Innovation &
Creativity Hub in 7 customary areas: Sorong, Jayapura, Fak-fak, Timika, Merauke,
Biak, and Wamena, by adopting the concepts of Silicon Valley and the Malaysian
Global Innovation & Creativity Center. The goal is to encourage Papuan youth to
become businessmen and social entrepreneurs7.

Human-based development, especially for indigenous Papuans, has shown tangible
results. Improving the quality of human resources is in line with the presence of
developing tourism areas. The international public has even recognized several
destinations, such as integrated areas in Sorong, Bintuni Bay, and Raja Ampat8.
As Indonesia’s youngest provinces, the provinces of Papua and West Papua are
like the country’s precious children who continue to be noticed in the Jokowi
administration. Jokowi’s deep concern for Papuans is also manifested in Presidential
Instruction No.9 of 2020 concerning the Acceleration of Welfare Development in
the Provinces of Papua and West Papua. Through this Presidential Instruction, the
government takes a development approach by focusing on indigenous Papuans’
welfare. Therefore, the development must be by socio-cultural conditions, customs
and still pay attention to environmental sustainability. The vice president Ma’ruf
Amin and other ranks of ministers would directly handle this acceleration of
development.
Concrete achievements proved the development program that Jokowi promised
during the presidential election campaign. Development in Jokowi’s eyes is not only
in physical development such as infrastructure but also the Papuan people. This
received a good response from the Papuan people, evidenced by their full support
for Jokowi - Ma’ruf Amin in the 2014 presidential election.

working visits to West Papua and massive infrastructure and human resource
development.
Unfortunately, the efforts made by the government to advance West Papua have
not gone smoothly. The Free Papua separatists have been constantly trying to hinder
development by:

The OPM-TPNPB armed separatists also stated that it would kill anyone carrying out
construction/development. Separatist efforts that always try to disrupt development
indicate that development that makes the Papuan people more advanced and prosperous
will eventually dim the issue of an independent West Papua. Also, separatists have been
using an independent West Papua issue to legalize their interests, such as corruption,
by taking village funds to buy weapons.
The separatist movement continues to launch its demands both at home and abroad.
Unfortunately, Indonesia’s demands were not accompanied by a clear plan for the
future development of West Papua. For example, Benny Wenda, leader of the ULMWP
separatists, asked in a BBC T alk interview regarding West Papua’s future development
plans. He said that the Papuan people do not need development, West. Papua already
has everything and has the potential to become a “green country. ”
Separatists’ rumors that Indonesia is not taking sides with the Papuan people is no
longer relevant. Development projects in recent years have left a positive impression
on the minds of the Papuan people. Currently, the Papuan people are enjoying the
benefits of development in various cities to rural areas.

various implementations of development and government administration except for
authority in the fields of foreign policy, defense and security, monetary and fiscal,
religion, and the judiciary. With this law’s existence, the Papuan people have the
freedom to choose the path to advance their own region.
T o use the authority properly, the Special Autonomy Law’s issuance was also
accompanied by the Majelis Rakyat Papua (MRP , lit. Papuan People’s Council). In this
case, the MRP has an important role in protecting the indigenous rights of the Papuan
people based on respect for customs and culture, empowering women, and continuing
religious harmony on the land of West Papua. The MRP members are indigenous
Papuans representing indigenous peoples, religious communities, and representatives
of Papuan women. The MRP has the right and authority to give consideration and
approval to all development implementation in West Papua carried out by the regional
government.
The Papuan people have a vital role in the development process of the region. Through
the special autonomy law, Papuan people are expected to make maximum use of their
special rights and authorities in managing development in West Papua.

Increasing Positive Perceptions of West Papua’s
Development
Indonesia has put Papua and West Papua provinces in a special place compared to other
provinces. These two provinces have a broader authority and power through special
autonomy to manage their own regions within the Republic of Indonesia framework.
Papua and West Papua development originate from the people, the people, and the
Papuan people.
The Papuan people have benefited from the development carried out by both the
central and regional governments. The impact of development has made life easier
for people, especially those living in remote areas. The community’s high cost of living
needs has gradually decreased, and the opening of new transportation routes both on
land and in the air. The Human Development Index or HDI in the two Provinces also
continues to show an increase. The positive response from the community has shown
that development is right on target.
For years, development in Indonesia was still centered on the island of Java. This
has created a huge gap between people’s lives in the western and eastern regions of
Indonesia. However, Jokowi has been trying to apply equitable development in all
corners of the country, especially Papua. This is evidenced by Jokowi’s intensive visits
to Papua in parallel with the massive development there.

The development approach in West Papua is unique compared to other regions. In this
case, the government must pay attention to and prioritize environmental sustainability,
customary rights, and socio-culture. Development should also align with Special
Autonomy’s objectives by paying attention to respect for human rights, the realization
of justice and the economy, and increasing welfare for the Papuan people.
T o improve West Papuans’ development and welfare, the government has distributed
the Special Autonomy Fund since 2002. In addition, in 2006, the government began
disbursing additional infrastructure funds aimed at accelerating infrastructure
development. The special autonomy fund given to the two provinces is equal to 2% 10
from the national general allocation fund and continues to increase from year to
year11 as well as making a significant contribution to development in West Papua.
Since the enactment of Special Autonomy for Papua and West Papua, the government
has distributed special autonomy funds for the two province amounting to Rp. 94.24
trillion12.
Several cities in Papua and West Papua provinces have begun implementing the Special
Autonomy funds for infrastructure and inter-regional connectivity. A Papuan leader,
Izak Randi Hikoyabi, viewed infrastructure development that facilitates access for the
community, and various sectors will also benefit from this development. “Currently,
our children have been enjoying infrastructure development. They also feel they have
a lot of easy access, ” During the Jokowi period, several mega projects have shown their
results, as summarized in the figures below.

One of the mega projects launched since 1980 is constructing the Trans-Papua road,
but the construction has not been completed. This project was finally largely completed
in 2018 during President Jokowi’s era. The Trans-Papua highway is an important
milestone for West Papua. This project has cost a huge amount of around IDR 12
trillion and has been going on since 2015-2018, 13 This road stretches for 4,330 km
connecting all cities and regencies in the provinces of Papua and West Papua.
Before the Trans-Papua road construction was complete, West Papuans needed to go
through valleys, hills, and forests by foot to transport goods. This impacted the high
prices of necessities and transportation. With the Trans-Papua road, people can travel in
a relatively short time. Benjamin Akemi, a teacher in T amra District, commented about
the newly built road. “(In the past) we walked by foot through high mountains, valleys,
peaks, until we were able to go to places where we teach. We don’t use the plane, we
walk. The construction was extraordinary. The Papuan people, they are happy. ”14
But there are still problems to be solved. Papua’s geographical contours are full of
mountains and surrounded by dense forests, sometimes making air transportation the
only way.

The Jokowi administration has pursued
development through the Jembatan Udara
(Air Bridge) program. T o reduce price
disparities in the interior and in urban areas,
the Jokowi administration has even provided
subsidies to reduce the very high logistics
and cargo costs of aircraft. The Air Bridge
program is very helpful for rural communities,
especially to meet their basic daily needs.
As expressed by Yosua Busup, the Korupun
District Chief, Yahukimo said, “Now there
is an Air Bridge, the prices of all goods have
dropped, the people are very happy. They are
happy now. ”15
Development in Papua and West Papua
is the realization of the 2015-2019
Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah
Nasional (RPJMN, National Medium T erm
Development Plan). The current existence of a
more supportive infrastructure can indirectly facilitate the community towards
economic and social welfare.
Not stopping at infrastructure, the government also pays more attention to West

Development Index (HDI) in Indonesia. Still, the government’s full attention through
development, health, and education indirectly impact increasing HDI. Although the
movement of the numbers above is not very significant, it always shows a gradual
increase. In 2018 alone, Papua province’s HDI was on 60.1, and West Papua province
was on 63.7 outperformed neighboring Pacific countries such as the Solomon Islands
with 55.7 and Papua New Guinea 54,317.
The Jokowi administration has succeeded in elevating West Papua so that it can
catch up with other regions. This achievement is evidenced by various development
approaches, both physically, in infrastructure, and in the people. The Papuan people
are happy with infrastructure development that supports the mobility of goods and
people. They feel the benefits in real terms.
In 2018, researchers conducted in-depth interviews and surveys in several cities in
West Papua to examine community responses to development performance. From
the table above, it can be seen that the development performance received positive
responses, especially in the health sector. The education sector has not improved
much since previous years except for Sorong City, while the infrastructure sector has

improved except for Wamena City. The findings above illustrate that the need for more
government attention to the education sector in West Papua. The positive performance
of the government must be improved from time to time. Simultaneously, areas that are
considered to have less impact on society need to be evaluated so that both physical
and non-physical development can run simultaneously.

The subject of development must touch various aspects of life, such as the economy,
politics, socio-culture, environment, and security. Therefore, development goals
are not merely physical aspects such as infrastructure but also the quality of human
resources. The recent acceleration of development in West Papua has positively
impacted society, although matters related to increasing resources and basic human
rights still need more attention.
Especially in infrastructure development, where many parties can directly see and feel
the results. The perceived progress of infrastructure has left a positive impression on
the community regarding the development performance carried out by the Jokowi
administration.
Development in Numbers
The prolonged conflict did wonders of slowing the development in West Papua. For
this reason, the Jokowi administration has taken a multidimensional approach, such
as economic, infrastructure, social, cultural, and security approaches. The government
does not prioritize one approach and ignore others because they are connected.

114 Chapter 4. Development in West Papua We Need To Talk About West Papua
Although the Special Autonomy Fund’s economic approach appears dominant, the
Jokowi administration has not neglected other important factors.
The Special Autonomy Fund makes a real contribution to the development of West
Papua in general. Several developments in numbers divided into several dimensions
show the following results:
Cultural Identity:  The cultural identity of the Papuan people continues to be
preserved and recognized. The government encourages the creation of cultural
festivals and introduces Papuan culture abroad.
Economy: The increasing Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) of Papua
and West Papua Provinces from year to year has resulted in a reduction in
unemployment and poverty rates.
Infrastructure: Road infrastructure shows improvement, while bridge
infrastructure continues to grow.
T echnology Access: Papua province has the lowest level of technology access.
However, the government has also built the telecommunication and internet
network called East Palapa Ring so that access to information and communication
can be integrated.
Education: School enrollment and literacy rates in Papua and West Papua
Provinces continue to increase.
Health: Life expectancy in the Provinces of Papua and West Papua shows an
increase.
Overall, development based on cultural identity, economy, infrastructure, access to
technology, education, and health shows a very positive improvement. The Jokowi
administration has indeed lived up to its promise to develop West Papua and provided
tangible results.
1. Cultural Identity
The Papuan people need to recognize their cultural identity because of the
prolonged discrimination due to the racial differences that are so striking between
the Melanesian race and most Indonesian people who have a Malay race. The
integration of West Papua into an integral part of Indonesia is not accompanied by
cultural assimilation between Papuan cultural identity and Indonesian identity.
Facing this reality, the Jokowi administration continues to rebuild recognition of
Papuan culture to remain protected as the influence of globalization enters the
region. The Jokowi administration developed an approach by recognizing the rights
of minorities, which gives Papuans the ability to express their cultural rights and
identity.

Not only that, but the Jokowi administration also introduced Papuan identity or
culture both nationally and internationally. In the national scope, it recently held the

development and utilization of Papuan culture through the Creative Arts Festival
“Bunga Rampai Papua Culture Under The Moonlight” in collaboration with the
Indonesian American Friendship Association (PPIA) The Indonesian Jesuit Alumni
Association. The event featured the indigenous Papuan culture of traditional dance,
traditional culinary, craft, fine arts, and Papuan regional music.

In the international sphere, the Ministry of Education and Culture proposes that
noken (woven bags derived from tree fibers) be recognized internationally as the
Papuan people’s cultural heritage. These efforts paid off with the designation of
Noken as a world cultural heritage by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on December 4, 2012, in Paris, France. Besides,
on 9 November 2018, musical arts from Eastern Indonesia, especially West Papua,
were featured in the Friendship Concert at the Opera House, Wellington, Australia.
The agenda initiated by the Indonesian Embassy in Wellington aims to provide an
understanding of the world that Indonesia and West Papua are part of the Pacific
community.
Furthermore, West Papua is also known for its football players. Many Indonesian
football stars were born in Papua’s land, including Rully Nere, Elie Aiboy, Eduard
Ivakdalam, Christian Warobay, Titus Bonai Oktavianus Maniani, and Boaz Solossa.

On June 15, 2019, Indonesia, together with Vanuatu, held a friendly match.
Indirectly, Indonesia wants to show Vanuatu that all this time, the “black pearl” has
played a significant role in the world of Indonesian sports. It’s not like Vanuatu’s
accusation that their brothers, Papuans who are Melanesian, are not allowed to
express themselves.
In recent years, festivals that promote Papuan culture have been held in several
cities and are set to become a yearly routine. The cultural festival in West Papua
aims to preserve and introduce the cultural heritage of the Papuan people to the
world.

Cultural identity is the most important part of the Papuan people that should
not be ignored because it is related to life’s rights and basic values   . The Jokowi
administration’s efforts in developing Papua by elevating local cultural identities
show a progression from year to year. On various occasions, Papuan cultural identity
has been introduced to audiences at the regional, national, and international levels.
2. Economy
One component in measuring regional economic growth is by referring to the Gross
Regional Domestic Product (GRDP). Every year, the GRDP of Papua and West Papua
provinces shows an increase. This has an indirect impact on the economic condition
of West Papua, which in general shows a change for the better.
Papua and West Papua Provinces’ contribution to national income in 2019 is in the
17th and 28th positions with a value of IDR 189 trillion and IDR 84 trillion from
34 Provinces in Indonesia. Furthermore, the GRDP of the two provinces shows a
gradual increase every year, except in 2019, the GRDP of Papua Province shows a
decline, although not significant. Most of the region’s income comes from the mining
and processing industries, especially coal, construction and forestry, fisheries, and
agriculture.

In the 2015-2019 period, the average percentage of unemployment in Indonesia was
5%. The Open Unemployment Rate is an indication of the population with working-
age categories that are included in the unemployment group. Groups included in
the Open Unemployment Rate category are residents who are not working and
looking for work, residents who do not work and prepare for businesses, residents
who do not work and do not look for work because they feel they cannot get work,
and finally are residents who are not working, are not looking for work, have already
accepted into the workplace but not yet working (National Labor Force Survey).

Many poor people in Papua dan West Papua provinces are a collective work for
the government, especially the regional government, which has full authority in
regulating the Papuan people’s welfare. Regional policies are structured so that
indigenous Papuans’ welfare increases and can be involved in economic development.
These policies include affirmative action and also Governor Regulation Number
14 of 2019 concerning the Procurement of Goods and Services in Papua and
West Papua. Both policies aim to accelerate welfare development for indigenous
Papuans by providing opportunities and prioritizing indigenous Papuans in various
opportunities.
Economic growth in the provinces of Papua and West Papua, in general, shows a
positive number. The increase in GRDP indirectly resulted in a decrease in the open
unemployment rate and the two provinces’ poor population.
3. Infrastructure
It cannot be denied that infrastructure development in West Papua costs a lot. One
of the projects that cost the most is Trans-Papua road construction. The Trans-
Papua road is a national road connecting the provinces of Papua and West Papua.
The condition of national roads in the two provinces in the 2017-2018 period
continued to improve. The data above shows that repair of damaged or “unstable”
national roads in Papua is faster than in West Papua.

km in West Papua and 4,713 km in Papua Province even though there is an increase
in the “collapsed” bridges in Papua Province. Many villages in West Papua can finally
enjoy electricity.
In October 2016, President Jokowi inaugurated six new power plants,
including;
2x10 MW Orya Genyem Hydro Power Plant
2x1 25 MW Prafi Mini Hydro Power Plant

4. Access to Technology
Access to information technology
in Indonesia is quite slow because
many areas outside Java do
not have adequate network
access. T oday, cellular telephone
coverage has covered almost
all regions in Indonesia. The
importance of network equity
is to support economic growth,
education, health, and others.
All aspects of life in globalization
cannot be separated from
technology, especially the internet.
T o measure the development of
information and communication
technology and find out the digital
gap between regions, Indonesia
uses standard measures such as the Information and Communication T echnology
(ICT) Development Index. In Indonesia itself, the regions with the lowest ICT
Development Index are in the eastern region, especially Papua Province. The
West Papua Province has experienced a category shift from low to medium ICT
Development Index from 4.84 in 2017 to 5.07 in 2018.
There are only a few network providers available in West Papua. Until now, there
are three providers, such as T elkomsel, XL, and Indosat. T elkomsel is the only
provider most widely used by the people because it covers even the remotest area.
The limited number of network operators means that operator tariffs are quite
high compared to other regions in Indonesia. The limited network operators in
West Papua are primarily caused by the geographic conditions that are mostly still
covered in forests, the population that is only concentrated in big cities, and the
high maintenance costs. As a consequence, ICT in West Papua has quite a gap with
other regions.

Several cities and districts in West Papua, especially those in remote areas, still use
3G and even 2G while other areas can access the 4G network. This imbalance in
technology has an indirect impact on development in general.
In 2016, the Jokowi administration determined the Palapa Ring or national fiber-
optic network construction as a national strategic project based on Presidential
Regulation Number 3 of 2016. The Palapa Ring development aims to integrate the
existing network with the new network in eastern Indonesia or the East Palapa Ring
and as the backbone for the national telecommunications system. The East Palapa
Ring is built with a length of 4,450 km. Through this network, access to information
and communication is expected to be felt evenly throughout Indonesia, especially
eastern Indonesia. As of September 2020, the construction of the East Palapa Ring
has been running 78.5%18.
5. Education
Apart from infrastructure development, human resource development through
education is equally important. There is a close relationship between development
and education, where development in the education sector will support development
in other sectors. The Jokowi administration has not neglected the importance of
human resource development, especially in the education sector. As regions with
the lowest literacy and school enrollment rates in Indonesia, the Provinces of Papua
and West Papua continue to improve their human resources quality.

Unlike West Papua, the literacy rate and enrollment rate in Papua Province are
arguably the lowest in Indonesia. The Jokowi administration’s efforts in developing
the education sector have resulted in an increasing school participation rate,
especially in the 2015-2019 period. Likewise, the literacy rate also shows an increase
in the same period. This indicates a correlation between school participation and
literacy rates where the increase in school participation has an indirect impact on
increasing literacy rates in Papua province.
6. Health
In the health sector, the Jokowi administration has committed to improving access
to health in Papua and West Papua continuously. One of the indicators used to
assess health quality in an area is by looking at life expectancy. Although people’s
life expectancy in Papua is low, this figure shows an increase from year to year.

The government also pays attention to human development, especially through
health, education, and socio-culture. Without the support of qualified human
resources and the respect for local culture, the development will fail.
The data above shows how the life of the Papuan people has progressed. The
development has made it easier for Papuans to meet basic needs and accessibility.
The increase in development in recent years shows Jokowi’s concern for the Papuan
people.
Therefore, it is also important for the Papuan people to be involved and take
advantage of the various facilities provided by the central and regional governments
to improve the quality of life. Qualified resources needed in West Papua are none
other than for Papuan people to manage their own areas for welfare and improve
the quality of life.

Human Based Development
In human-based development, the Jokowi Administration has reduced unemployment,
improved the economy, and introduced Papuan identity. However, several important
things must be highlighted:
1. Indigenous Papuans Needs
Development and improvement efforts for the welfare of the Papuan people are
still the main problem to date. The allocation of special autonomy funds to empower
the people’s economy has not been successful. It has even created new problems.
Unclear management and the inability to allocate special autonomy funds are
the main causes of development failure. This is coupled with the condition of the
Papuan people who have different cultures that require different approaches.
Development requires a special approach because it cannot be generalized from
one region to another 19. Special Autonomy, which was intended to improve the
quality of life, especially in fulfilling the Papuan people’s basic rights, is still far from
expectations. Therefore, how development can adapt to the natural conditions and
characteristics of the Papuan people and how the results can meet life’s needs must
be classified by the parties concerned.

Chapter 4. Development in West Papua We Need To Talk About West Papua 131
On the one hand, the news in West Papua mostly focuses on politics and security
issues. This indirectly instills thoughts in the public’s minds and the central
government that the main problems there only revolve around these two problems.
In fact, there are other dimensions, such as socio-culture and the fulfillment of
basic rights, that have not received significant attention. On the other hand, the
government is actually carrying out large-scale developments such as building
roads, national bridges, sports buildings, etc. Large-scale development is intended
for the long term so that the impacts and benefits cannot be felt as early as possible.
However, Papuan people feel that the development carried out often does not care
about their life needs.
Basically, the Papuan people only want their basic rights protected, sufficient
clothing and food, and people living on Papua’s land can respect each other. The
government has to take a different approach because each region in West Papua
has its own problems to solve.
It is necessary to look at the different needs of each region. For this reason, the
authors classify them into 3 main zones, 1) undeveloped areas, 2) new and developing
areas, and 3) developed districts/cities.
Underdeveloped Areas
Most of the underdeveloped areas are located in the central highlands or the heart
of Papua’s island, including the districts of Yalimo, Yahukimo, Nduga, Lanny Jaya,
and T olikara, Mamberamo T engah, and Puncak Jaya. Mountains surround these
isolated areas’ geographical contour and far from economic activities. These areas
are far from development because transportation access is quite difficult. Most of
the goods are imported from big cities in West Papua, such as Jayapura. Economic
activities still depend heavily on small retail trade and agriculture, most of which
are consumed for their own needs.

132 Chapter 4. Development in West Papua We Need To Talk About West Papua
The basic needs of people living in this area include basic human needs such as
clothing, food, and shelter. The health sector’s need is equally important given the
HIV/AIDS problem, and the death rate caused by malaria is so high in West Papua.
Besides, special attention is needed in education, especially for tutors or teachers
assigned there: Cultural, geographic, and weather conditions, present challenges
for teachers, especially those outside the region. The inability to adapt to new
situations can hinder the teaching and learning process.
New and developing areas
One of the developing areas where infrastructure development has just started is
Wamena Regency. Districts/cities categorized as new or developing need special
attention and management because this area is undergoing a transition. On the one
hand, basic needs such as clothing, food, shelter, education, and health are still the
main focus. On the other hand, the government needs to guide socialization and
community-based empowerment so that the Papuan people are not left behind
and can follow their region’s development. The empowerment program that is
introduced will have to adapt to the geographical and socio-cultural conditions,
including the local community’s customs.

Chapter 4. Development in West Papua We Need To Talk About West Papua 133
Developed Areas
Districts/cities included in the developed category have adequate infrastructure
facilities, such as Sorong, Jayapura, and Merauke. The government can carry out
sustainable development by empowering the community’s economy based on local
potentials such as agriculture, tourism, and home industries.
One example of a community-based program is community-based tourism that has
been implemented in Raja Ampat Regency. As an area known for its marine tourism,
the local government needs to involve the community in managing their own
tourist areas. The government needs to carry out socialization and guidance to put
forward business fields that show more local culture. This community involvement
is significant. Besides being able to increase income and welfare, they also act as
supervisors to maintain the culture and preserve nature to create sustainable
development for future generations. In this region, community empowerment
aims to increase productivity and competitiveness so that Papuans can compete in
various fields of work.
The government needs to evaluate and remap the development program based
on the local community’s socio-cultural conditions. So far, the government’s
development is deemed not on target because it ignores the main needs of the
Papuan people. As a result, there was a feeling that the central government was
not on their side and that the presence of the Special Autonomy Fund aimed at
improving the quality of life for indigenous Papuans was in vain. It is no longer a
matter of equitable development but development based on local priority needs
that can actually improve the welfare of the people there.

2. Integration of Development for indigenous Papuans
    and migrants
The face of West Papua has changed due to the Dutch colonial legacy program in
transmigration, which was continued in the Sukarno and Suharto era. Because of the
transmigration program, people from outside the land of Papua or newcomers flocked
to look for business opportunities. Migrants have indirectly boosted the economy
in West Papua. Unfortunately, the increasing economic growth is not in line with the
increasing welfare of indigenous Papuans. Economic growth has not touched society
down to the lowest level. Even today, Papua is the province with the highest poverty rate
in Indonesia, with 20% in the last five years20. As a result, there is an obvious economic
disparity between migrants and indigenous Papuans.

Chapter 4. Development in West Papua We Need To Talk About West Papua 135
In fact, the main problem lies in the
unequal competition between migrants
and local people. Armed with the skills
and knowledge they have, newcomers
can reach business opportunities by
setting up shops and buildings that
are more feasible and are involved in
various economic activities. At the
same time, the indigenous community
only trades in the overhang or market
aisles. This kind of scene can be found
in traditional markets in various regions
in West Papua 21. Also, the presence of
large companies presents new problems
Indigenous people are no longer confronted with migrants, but large companies
often use security forces to deal directly with residents. The non-involvement of
local communities in business affairs and natural resource management has sparked
protests among local communities.
Basically, migrants, including companies in the land of Papua, had a positive and
negative impact. The negative impacts include environmental damage caused by
the company’s arbitrary management of natural resources. Besides, the selfishness
of immigrants makes life inequality even more unbalanced. However, migrants’
presence has also positively impacted, such as opening up jobs and growing
economic activity in various regions.

The migrants have inspired many locals to follow in their footsteps, for example, by
entering the trade and services sector. Many indigenous Papuans have since pursued
these two fields, and not a few of them have achieved success and empowered their
fellow Papuans. For example, Markus Kabes is an entrepreneur in the automotive or
repair service sector, and Paulinus Yarok works in laying hens who also learn from
other non-Papuan breeders. The service sector, especially automotive and chicken
breeders, is still a rare business sector in local communities.
The growth of the business community and indigenous Papuan entrepreneurs is
proof that many locals have entered the business world. One of the organizations
that house Papuan entrepreneurs is the Kamar Adat Pengusaha Papua (KAPP ,
Papuan Entrepreneurs Customary Chamber) or the Kamar Dagang dan Industri
(KADIN, Trade and Industry Chamber) of indigenous Papuans. KAPP’s existence
aims to accommodate, protect, and protect Papuan traditional child entrepreneurs
under the Special Autonomy Law (Lipi, tt)22. Most Papuans still think that becoming
Pegawai Negeri Sipil (PNS, Civil Servants) can guarantee their lives rather than
struggling in other fields such as business. This way of thinking is one reason why
Papuans are hesitant to enter and cultivate other fields, especially business, ignoring
the fact that Papua’s land is an auspicious place to start a business. This condition is
exacerbated by the low quality of human resources and skills, making it difficult for
indigenous Papuans to be accepted to work.
T o overcome this problem, it is necessary to have the government create more
empowerment programs involving local communities. The government needs to
support the Papuan people engaged in business or services by providing funding or
taking a partnership-based approach in various government projects.

Furthermore, migrants who have businesses in West Papua are also encouraged
to pay more attention to the Papuan people’s traditional life instead of merely
pursuing economic gain. The role of migrants is very significant in advancing local
communities and vice versa.
3. Human Centered Design
The government has made various efforts, such as the development approach,
but these efforts are still unable to win Papuans’ hearts truly. This is due to the
different meaning of development between the central government, regional
governments, and the Papuan people. The central government views development
using a political perspective and a security approach. These efforts seem to ignore
the human element, which does not solve the root of the problem. A large amount
of development funds in West Papua has also not resolved the prolonged conflict.
Poverty and the low quality of human resources are still the main problems today.
In the end, the Papuan people’s future lays on their human development. The
development gives freedom, not freedom in a political sense, but as a human being
who is free to exercise basic rights based on culture, freedom from ignorance,
oppression, discrimination, backwardness, etc. This development pattern places an
increase in the quality of human resources as a measure of development success.
This does not mean neglecting physical development such as the economy and
infrastructure, but how both of them can increase Papuan human resources.

138 Chapter 4. Development in West Papua We Need To Talk About West Papua
The government should be able to harmonize development based on the
aspirations of the Papuan people. In this case, the local government is the one who
best understands the main needs in West Papua. The approach taken to coastal
communities is certainly different from mountain communities and between urban
and rural communities. Development that ignores local Papuan needs has failed
even before the start of development itself.
Furthermore, the government’s responsibility here is to facilitate, encourage, and
provide facilities and infrastructure to support multi-dimensional empowerment
programs, such as education, health, natural resource management, preservation
of identity and culture, training in various fields, etc. Because humans are the object
and the subject, development must emphasize the regular and continuous transfer
of knowledge, technology, and skills. What has been learned can be continued to
create an independent, prosperous, and competitive society.
Human-centered development aims to realize the importance of their role in the
environment or the surrounding community. The more knowledgeable the Papuan
people are, the greater their role in taking on their region’s roles and responsibilities.
Indirectly this will support other development programs.

Chapter 4. Development in West Papua We Need To Talk About West Papua 139
4. Recommended Development Stages in West Papua
Based on the various explanations and data previously discussed, the authors
recommend several development stages for West Papua.
The government should remap the Papuan people’s main needs based on each
region’s cultural and geographical conditions. In general, to see the Papuan
people’s main needs, it can be seen from the three zoning areas, namely
undeveloped areas, new and developing regions, and developed areas. Each
region has different needs and cannot be generalized. It is also necessary to
view development from the perspective of the Papuan people themselves and
not be dominated by the point of view of the central government.
The government must increase community economic empowerment programs
and provide funding for the Papuan people involved in the business world. Also,
a partnership-based approach involves more Papuans in various government
projects.
The importance of placing human resource quality improvement as a measure of
development success, but on the other hand, infrastructure-based development
must run simultaneously.

140 Chapter 4. Development in West Papua We Need To Talk About West Papua
The Papuan separatist group continues to spread propaganda and
disinformation about West Papua through mass media. The goal is to attract
the world’s attention so that separatists continue to get funds from certain
sympathizers. Although the relationship between Indonesia and Papua has
improved, separatists are still using bad relations in the past to pressure the
Indonesian government.
If we look deeper, the demand for these separatists does not represent the
Papuan people who hope for a life of peace and prosperity. The acts of violence
committed by the armed separatists while the development process was taking
place had, in fact, hampered development for West Papua. So, is it correct to
say that they are fighting for the  Papuan people?
Separatist groups have never highlighted that the government’s efforts and
approach to West Papua continue to lead to a more positive relationship.
Starting from the reign of Habibie to Jokowi, development policies in West
Papua have never gone unnoticed by the government. This indicates that
West Papua still hopes to become a region that has progressed together with
other provinces in Indonesia. Especially during Jokowi’s leadership, the peak
of Indonesia’s concern for the Papuan people was shown by the existence of a
massive and evenly distributed development program, from cities to the rural
areas.
Furthermore, Special Autonomy is proof that the government guarantees
the rights and freedoms of the Papuan people to manage and advance their
region. It means that Papuan development’s progress lies in the hands of the
native Papuans themselves, but there are still many shortcomings that need
to be solved. The involvement of separatists who have used development
funds, the lack of transparency in the use of funds, and corruption among the
regional elite are still happening today, which is one of the many problems that
hinder development. However, development should not be stopped because
the progress of infrastructure and human resources in West Papua is clear
evidence that local young generations can also develop their own regions.
C. Conclusion

Chapter 4. Development in West Papua We Need To Talk About West Papua 141
The past conditions of a marginal and underdeveloped West Papua are no
longer relevant today. Now the Papuan people are more advanced both in
terms of infrastructure and human resources. The benefits of development
are proven by statistical figures and are currently being enjoyed by the Papuan
people. What the Papuan people are experiencing today is none other than
another form of independence for them—freedom from ignorance, freedom
from poverty, and freedom to live the Papuan people’s cultural life.

Free Papua Armed Separatists Crimes in the
Last Few Years
The Free Papua Movement operating in West Papua has frequently been committing
acts of violence against civilians and security forces. The Indonesian government
does not condone separatist violence because it threatens and kills lives, thus
categorizing this illegal act as a crime. As a result, Papuan armed separatists are given
a special title, namely Kelompok Kriminal Bersenjata (KKB; lit. armed criminal
group). The following is a list of crimes committed by armed separatists in the last
three years:
2018
According to the CNN Indonesia report, there were 26 cases of shootings by Free
Papua armed separatists throughout 2018, which killed 29 people, 22 of whom were
civilians, and the remaining 7 were security forces. The following is a timeline of the
armed separatists’ crimes in 2018:

The Chronology of Wamena-Jayapura Riots
August 16, 2019
Indonesian community organizations and nationalists
surrounded the Papuan student dormitory in
Surabaya City, East Java Province, because there were
allegations that the Papuan students destroyed the
Indonesian flag in front of the dorm. The security forces
were deployed to mediate between the people who
were angry and made racist remarks. The recorded
hate speech against Papuan students sparked a huge
reaction from Papuans a few days later.
August 17, 2019
Security forces brought 43 Papuan students living at the Papuan Student Dormitory
in Surabaya City, East Java Province, to be questioned regarding the news of the
destruction of the Indonesian flag.
The Wamena and Jayapura riots in September 2019 in Papua seemed to have occurred
organically due to racist remarks. But aligning them with the world’s timeline, the two
riots unexpectedly coincided with the 2019 UN Session. The following is a detailed
chronology:

A twin protests that ended in rioting took place in Jayapura City, Papua Province and
Wamena District of Jayawijaya Regency. The riot was allegedly triggered by hoaxes
about a teacher making racist remarks at school.
This is the second time a riot happened in Jayapura, in about a month after the first
Jayapura Riot. Normally, an issue will eventually cool down after a few weeks, not to
mention that a month has passed since the Surabaya incident. However, the Second
Jayapura Riot did happen coincidentally with the Wamena Riot.
The riots were almost certainly planned as it also coincided with the 2019 United
Nations (UN) General Debate that would start on September 24, 2019. In addition, the
twin riots have a strong impression to be fabricated by reigniting the issue of racism
that had cooled down.

to death by an unknown person mingling with the student protesters.

September 23, 2019
A twin protests that ended in rioting took place in Wamena District of Jayawijaya
Regency and Jayapura City, Papua Province. The riot was allegedly triggered by hoaxes
about a teacher making racist remarks at school on September 18, 2019.
The school had mediated the misunderstanding between the teacher and the student
related to the racist remarks and the case had also been solved amicably. However,
residents and students in Wamena already believed the hoax spread through the
online messenger. A group of people then attacked the related school and then the
rioting spread to all corners of Wamena. If not because of certain parties involvement
in spreading the hoax and raising the racist remarks again, there wouldn’t be any riot
in Wamena or in Jayapura.
The riot in Wamena left 33 residents dead, 224 large and small vehicles damaged, 465
shophouses and 165 houses burned down. Meanwhile, the rioting in Jayapura left
1 victim dead, a member of the security forces. Further investigation found that the
protests were organized by the Free Papua separatists to gain spotlight in the moment
of the 2019 UN Session.
The protest, which was allegedly carried out by 200 Wamena students, was infiltrated
by unknown people who did not come from Wamena. The residents of Wamena
themselves were busy rescuing the migrants who were the targets of arson and
murder by the intruders in the protesters. Some residents even testified that there
were bearded adults wearing unfitting high school uniforms among Wamena student
protesters.

September 24, 2019
The 2019 UN Session took place in New York, United States, on September 17-30,
2019. Then the UN General Debate was held September 24-27, 2019. At this UN
Session, there were delegations from the Pacific Islands, such as Vanuatu, who raised
Papua’s issue and past human rights violations that had occurred in Papua when the
Suharto military regime was still in control of Indonesia. Indonesia anticipated these
Pacific Island countries’ predictable steps from year to year.
The Wamena-Jayapura Riots, which was instigated by the separatist group Komite
Nasional Papua Barat (KNPB, lit. West Papua National Committee) and the United
Liberation Movement of West Papua (ULMWP) just a day before the 2019 UN General
Debate, was a separatist step to raise the issue of racism to attract the attention of
member countries of the UN Assembly. This riot made it easier for the Vanuatu
delegation as the spearhead of Free Papua separatists to raise Papua’s issue at the UN
Session.

168 APPENDIX We Need To Talk About West Papua
After the Wamena-Jayapura Riots in September 2019, Indonesian authorities
named seven separatists as political prisoners. The term “political prisoner” is used
to distinguish Papuan separatists who worked behind the scenes as masterminds of
the Wamena-Jayapura Riots from those who took to the streets. These separatists
come from various separatist groups, such as Komite Nasional Papua Barat (KNPB,
lit. West Papua National Committee) and the United Liberation Movement of West
Papua (ULMWP). There are also those from the Aliansi Mahasiswa Papua (AMP , lit.
Papuan Student Alliance) who have been sowing the seeds of separatism among
Papuan students who are still in school. The six political prisoners are:
1. Buchtar Tabuni
Buchtar T abuni is the central leader of the KNPB and concurrently the second
Deputy Chairperson of the ULMWP Legislative Body. Buchtar T abuni coordinated the
Wamena-Jayapura twin riots, which caused 37 deaths, damaged 600 public facilities,
and displaced 17,000 people.
Not only did he mobilize the masses to riot, but Buchtar T abuni also had a direct
relationship with the ULMWP leader, Benny Wenda, who attended the UN General
Assembly on September 24, 2019, exactly one day after the riots took place on
September 23, 2019. By sparking riots, Buchtar T abuni and Benny Wenda can freely
raise the Free Papua issue at the UN Session.

Evidence of the Papuan Political Prisoners
Involvement as Perpetrators of the Wamena-
Jayapura Riots
The Wamena-Jayapura Riots (September 23, 2019) were not organic protests related
to the Surabaya Incident (August 16, 2019) but were steered by interested parties.
The following are some peculiar facts that show the artificial side of the Wamena-
Jayapura Riots:
Rioters Deliberately Hunts Non-Papuans
In the Wamena riots on September 23, 2019, Wamena residents testified that they had
seen rioters wearing school uniforms deliberately chasing, burning, and killing non-
Papuans living in Wamena. Apart from that, rioters also burned and destroyed houses,
buildings, and vehicles belonging to the migrants. Indigenous Papuans who are trying
to save non-Papuans are also being chased and hunted down.
Because Wamena is a small town, the people of Wamena know each other quite
well. Many Papuans and non-Papuans testified that the rioters who carried out the
destruction and killings in Wamena were not Wamena residents. They were unknown
people who came from outside Wamena.

APPENDIXWe Need To Talk About West Papua 173
Wamena Locals were Trying Hard to Save Their Migrant
Neighbors
In Wamena Riot, indigenous Papuans living in Wamena hid migrants inside their houses
to save them from rioters’ attack. A Wamena resident of Sumatra descent testified that
the natives had helped his family and 250 other migrants from the rioters.
A Papuan priest named Yason Yikwa evacuated 300 migrants to the church where he
served, while a civil servant named Titus Kogoya hid 80 migrants in his family home.
These two facts prove that the perpetrators of the riot were not residents of Wamena.
Migrants who originally lived in Wamena took refuge using a cargo transport plane belonging to the security
forces, which will take off from Manuhua, Wamena, Papua, on October 2, 2019. The fear and trauma caused by the
riot caused migrants to leave Wamena. (Source: jawapos.com)

Wamena Riot Happened Just A Day Before the UN General
Debate Visited by the Separatist Leader
The Wamena-Jayapura Riots, which was instigated by the separatist group Komite
Nasional Papua Barat (KNPB, lit. West Papua National Committee) and the United
Liberation Movement of West Papua (ULMWP) just a day before the 2019 UN General
Debate, was a separatist step to raise the issue of racism to attract the attention of
member countries of the UN Assembly. Not too coincidentally, the ULMWP leader,
Benny Wenda, attended the UN General Assembly on September 24, 2019, exactly
one day after the riots took place on September 23, 2019. By sparking riots, Benny
Wenda can freely raise the Free Papua issue at the UN Session.

Rioters are Members of the KNPB Separatist Group
Disguised as High School Students
The protest, which was allegedly carried out by 200 Wamena students, was infiltrated
by unknown people who did not come from Wamena. Some residents even testified
that there were bearded adults wearing unfitting high school uniforms among Wamena
student protesters.
Several members of Komite Nasional Papua Barat (KNPB, lit. West Papua National
Committee) forced people and students to rally. A middle school student named Frans
T abuni refused to participate in the protests when two KNPB members in high school
uniform ordered him. Because of his refusal, the two splashed fuel on T abuni’s body
and burned him. It means that there was some deliberate effort to trigger the riot from
the Free Papua separatists.

the Unrest and Asked Migrant Refugees to Return
and Live in Wamena Again

and condolences for the riots, which resulted in many victims from non-Papuans living
in Wamena. They also asked for the Wamena migrant refugees to return to Wamena

Chairperson of the ULMWP Legislative Body. Buchtar T abuni also had a direct
relationship with the ULMWP leader, Benny Wenda, who attended the UN General
Assembly on September 24, 2019, exactly one day after the riots took place on
September 23, 2019. Buchtar T abuni was the main link connecting Wamena-Jayapura

of students from outside Papua and provoked students to get involved in Jayapura
Riot I on August 29, 2019. Papuan human rights lawyer Gustaf Kawer admitted that
Ferry Kombo indeed planned the protest on Jayapura Riot I. Previously, AMP provoked
clashes between residents and officials in Malang, Semarang, and Surabaya. Using anti-
racism, all these clashes led to riots that culminated in Manokwari, West Papua, on
August 19, 2019, and the Jayapura Riot I.

A. List of Political Parties Supporting Free Papua
The Free Papua issue does not represent West Papuans’ stance in the independence
matter, but several overseas political parties’ agenda. The following is a list of parties
supporting Free Papua:
1. The UK Labor Party
The support from the UK Labor Party began
to emerge when Alex Sobel, a member of the
parliament of the United Kingdom from the
Labor Party and the initiator of the All-Party
Parliamentary Group (APPG) of West Papua,
held a meeting with the leader of the United
Liberation Movement of West Papua. West

4. Vanuatu Land and Justice Party
The biggest supporter of the ULMWP separatist group in Vanuatu is Vanuatu
Land and Justice Party, Ralph John Regenvanu. During the 2019 Vanuatu general
election, Regenvanu was one of the candidates for the Vanuatu Prime Minister. The
separatists’ leader from the ULMWP group, Benny Wenda, provided direct support
for the second meeting at Owen Hall, Port-Vila, Vanuatu. Ralph Regenvanu’s most
significant political maneuver was to raise Free Papua’s issue, which had succeeded
in increasing its popularity.
Previously, in the 2016 Vanuatu Election, Regenvanu only got 6 out of 52 seats.
However, with the support of ULMWP in 2019, Regenvanu’s popularity rose and
earned 1,589 votes and 8 seats.
At first, Ralph John Regenvanu was just an ordinary politician but after he initiated
the Wantok Blong Yumi Bill that said Vanuatu would not be fully independent until
the rest of the colonized Pacific nations, like Papua, would be politically free. With
3. New Zealand Green Party
The Greens, New Zealand politicians and activists, such as Maire Leadbeater, Keith
Locke, Barry Coates, Marama Davidson, Catherine Delahunty, Steffan Browning,
and Jan Logie, support the Free Papua Movement.

APPENDIXWe Need To Talk About West Papua 179
5. Fiji Social Democratic Liberal Party
ULMWP separatists group approached the Fiji opposition party, namely the Fiji
Social Democratic Liberal Party (SODELPA) to win the trust of the Melanesian
Spearhead Group’s state members with the hope of becoming a permanent member
of the MSG equivalent to a state so that they can receive MSG funding and support
from other countries, companies, and conglomerates.
Wantok Blong Yumi being finalized by the Parliament of Vanuatu in June 2010,
Regenvanu is free to politicize the Papua issue for his personal and political party
gain. In December 2010, Regenvanu formed the Vanuatu Land and Justice Party to
be Prime Minister candidate.
Wantok Blong Yumi Bill’s adoption encouraged the Vanuatu government to seek
West Papua to gain observer status in the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) and
Pacific Islands Forum (PIF). Wantok Blong Yumi Bill also stated that Vanuatu would
ask the General Assembly of the United Nations for an opinion and advice from
the International Court of Justice regarding the 1969 Act of Free Choice when the
Dutch handed over West Papua to Indonesia. Of course, this greatly boosted Ralph
Regenvanu’s popularity.

1. Sigrid Rausing Trust
The Sigrid Rausing Trust is an organization owned by Sigrid Rausing, the main
donor of the Green Party and the TAPOL UK organization, which both have a great
interest in Free Papua. Besides, Sigrid Rausing is the daughter of the owner of the
giant British company T etra Park. The Sigrid Rausing Trust also funds a British media
called Bellingcat, which massively operates accounts voicing Free Papua’s issue up
to 8,244 posts per month. Certainly, these facts are not mere coincidences. Why is
Sigrid Rausing so interested in the issue of Free Papua?
2. Sinchi Foundation
The British Labor Party has been playing the issue of Free Papua for at least 17
years by granting Benny Wenda residency status in the City of Oxford, led by the
mayor of the British Labor Party. Not only that, the British Labor Party even formed
2 organizations that only focus on the issue of Free Papua, namely IPWP and APPG
on West Papua, to seek support and money from politicians and companies. The
International Parliamentarians for West Papua (IPWP) is led by Labor politician
Andrew Smith and consists of international terrorist supporters and leftists who
support separatist movements.

182 APPENDIX We Need To Talk About West Papua
Meanwhile, APPG on West Papua, which seeks support from British politicians
and money from corporations, is led by Labor politician Alex Sobel and consists of
members of the British parliament, the majority of the Labor Party. However, it is
not only political parties that appear to be exploiting the Papua issue. UK-based
consulting firm IR Global set up the CSR agency Sinchi Foundation to interfere
with Papua’s issue. The Sinchi Foundation, created by IR Global, has a special Papua
project and invites the Dutch-based separatist Raki Ap and collaborates with Benny
Wenda in selling the issue of Free Papua in Europe.
Isn’t it suspicious, an international company as big as IR Global has created an
NGO to deal with the issue of Free Papua? Even though the flow of funds from the
company is not as transparent as Bellingcat and TAPOL UK, is it possible for an
international consulting firm like IR Global to be the second party to work according
to the client’s request as its source of money?
