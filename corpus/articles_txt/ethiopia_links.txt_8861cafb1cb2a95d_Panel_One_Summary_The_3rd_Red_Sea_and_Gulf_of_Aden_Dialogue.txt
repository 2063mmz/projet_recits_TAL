Panel One of the 3rd Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Dialogue convened regional experts, policymakers, and scholars to explore avenues for strengthening cooperation between the Horn of Africa and Gulf states. The discussion focused on deepening political, economic, and intellectual ties to foster a stable and mutually beneficial regional order. Three key themes emerged:
Institutionalizing Political Dialogue:
Participants stressed the urgency of formalizing political engagement between the Horn and the Gulf through structured mechanisms. Such institutionalization is seen as vital for building trust, enhancing coordination, and shaping a coherent regional security and development agenda.
Strengthening Analytical and Scholarly Engagement:
The panel emphasized the value of sustained collaboration between policy experts and research institutions across both regions. A forward-looking economic diplomacy – rooted in public diplomacy and mutual respect – was identified as a strategic tool for reinforcing interregional ties.
Proactive and Diversified Engagement by the Horn:
Horn of Africa countries were encouraged to adopt a proactive approach to attracting and leveraging Gulf partnerships. These partnerships should extend beyond foreign direct investment to include migrant diplomacy, academic exchange, cultural initiatives, and broader development cooperation frameworks.
