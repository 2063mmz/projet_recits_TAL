ON THE COVER
This year, South Africa and the world celebrate
the centenary of the birth of former President
Nelson Mandela. Born on 18 July 1918, Madiba
was the first President of a democratic South
Africa and a global icon who was revered
worldwide as a champion of human rights,
non-racism and non-sexism. He played a critical
role in unifying South Africans and inspiring
democratic unity across Africa and the globe.
As Chair of the Southern African Develop-
ment Community (SADC) from August 2017 to
August 2018; Brazil, Russia, India, China and
South Africa (BRICS) in 2018; and the Indian
Ocean Rim Association (IORA) from October
2017 to October 2019; and Co-Chair of the

F
rom 25 to 27 July 2018, I will
have the opportunity to host
my fellow Brazil, Russia,
India, China and South Africa
(BRICS) Counterparts on
the occasion of the 10th
BRICS Summit. The year 2018 holds special
significance in the BRICS historical trajectory
as it concludes the first decade of BRICS
summits at the highest diplomatic level. This
year is also important as the BRICS Chairship
coincides with the Year of Nelson Mandela, as
Towards the second decade
of strategic cooperation
By His Excellency, President Cyril Ramaphosa, President of the Republic of South Africa and Chairperson of BRICS 2018
South Africa and indeed the world celebrate
the centenary of his birth.
I have conveyed to my counterparts that
during the two-day event, it is South Africa’s
intention to reflect on the decade-long
cooperation and chart the way forward as
we usher in the second decade of BRICS
cooperation. It is with this in mind that South
Africa has chosen the theme for the 10th
BRICS Summit to be: “BRICS in Africa:
Collaboration for Inclusive Growth and Shared
Prosperity in the 4th Industrial Revolution”.
This theme is reflective of the core priorities
of BRICS as developed in the first decade of
the forum’s strategic cooperation. The BRICS
forum has committed itself to the creation of
inclusive development, by advancing global
partnerships based on mutual benefit and
openness, and that are reflective of the need
to address common challenges that will bring
prosperity to all humankind.
The reality that is the Fourth Industrial
Revolution has accorded us an opportunity
to express our core principles and navigate
Towards the second decade of strategic cooperation
South Africa, during its Chairship and as reflected in the theme, seeks to
consolidate the multisectoral progress that has been made by BRICS members
and build towards the realisation of alleviating our common challenges by
establishing a framework on the Fourth Industrial Revolution geared towards
support for industrialisation and sustainable development.

Towards the second decade of strategic cooperation
a global environment that is already on
the precipice of a dynamic shift in terms of
international politics and the global economy,
especially in the context of future economic
development.
In 2013, at the Meeting of BRICS Ministers
of Science, Technology and Innovation
(STI), held in Cape Town, the BRICS
member countries recognised the need to
develop STI cooperation and in subsequent
meetings further reinforced the need for the
advancement of innovation. The BRICS
Action Plan for Innovation Cooperation for
the period 2017 – 2020, adopted in 2017,
stressed the primacy of innovation as a key to
global sustainable development as it unlocks
human potential through entrepreneurship,
job creation and economic growth for the
benefit of society.
The BRICS countries also established a
broad framework for increased cooperation
with regard to economic development
and growth and the group’s global
competitiveness in 2015 increased with the
adoption of the BRICS Strategy for Economic
Partnership. This strategy sets an outline
for inclusive growth and shared prosperity
for BRICS members by advocating for
greater “macro-economic coordination and
fostering innovative economic development
based on advanced technologies and
skills development with a view to building
knowledge economies”.
During India’s Chairship of BRICS in
2016, the Jaipur Declaration was endorsed
by BRICS Leaders, setting the ground for
strengthened cooperation in STI by identifying
19 priority areas, notably innovation
advancement and technology transfer;
science parks and incubators; and  geospatial
technology and its application. China, as part
of its hosting of the G20 Summit in Hangzhou
(Hangzhou Summit) in 2016, also broadened
the scope by facilitating the adoption of the
G20 Blueprint on Innovative Growth and
the G20 New Industrial Revolution Action
Plan. At the crux of BRICS cooperation is
the need to ensure innovative growth by
addressing common challenges of poverty,
inequality and social exclusion and bridging
the technological gap.
BRICS Leaders in acknowledging the
progress made at the Hangzhou Summit
noted and celebrated the emphasis on the
developmental agenda and the need to
promote innovation in a global economic
environment requiring much-needed
cooperation to foster greater economic growth
and development. The Leaders “stressed
the importance to foster an innovative,
invigorated, interconnected and inclusive
world economy to usher in a new era of global
growth and sustainable development”. The
BRICS countries have set themselves on
a path to realise the empowerment of our
countries in the next phase of global economic
development.
In addressing STI and its strategies,
especially in the context of the Fourth Industrial
Revolution, BRICS has been cognisant of the
significant developments, notably: the Internet
of Things; Big Data and cloud computing;
Artificial Intelligence; and automation and
robotics, and the impact thereof on our way
of life such as in manufacturing and their
potential with regard to health with the advent
of nanotechnology and biotechnology.
South Africa, during its Chairship and as
reflected in the theme, seeks to consolidate
the multisectoral progress that has been
made by BRICS members and build towards
the realisation of alleviating our common
challenges by establishing a framework on the
Fourth Industrial Revolution geared towards
support for industrialisation and sustainable
development.
South Africa moreover wishes to seize the
opportunity presented by its 2018 Chairship of
BRICS to reiterate its commitment to further
strengthening relations with and among its
BRICS partners, the African continent and the
Global South.

A partnership for prosperity
by HE Michel Temer,
President of the Federative Republic of Brazil and incoming Chairperson of BRICS 2019
A partnership for prosperity
B
razil, Russia, India, China
and South Africa (BRICS)
Leaders are meeting in
Johannesburg inspired by
the centenary of Nelson
Mandela. In this 10th
Summit, we will be devoting particular attention
to the social and economic development of
Africa. Our host, President Cyril Ramaphosa,
has offered us a precious opportunity to
gather BRICS and African leaders around one
common objective: the prosperity of each of
our countries, the prosperity of Africa.
In 2011, South Africa joined our group
and the BRIC became BRICS. The addition
of an African country has helped BRICS to
consolidate its global identity and opened
new avenues of cooperation with one of the
most rapidly growing economic regions in the
world.
Brazil has long been an enthusiast of
strong ties between BRICS and Africa. We
are proud of our African roots. The majority
of the Brazilian population is of African origin,
which makes us the largest African country
outside the continent.
Brazil and Africa are also united by a
common language – the Portuguese. Brazil
has just concluded its two-year presidency
of the Community of Portuguese-speaking
Countries (CPLP, in its Portuguese acronym).
This forum gathers, in addition to Brazil,
Portugal and East Timor, six African countries:
Angola, Cape Verde, Equatorial Guinea,
Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique and São Tomé
and Principe. The Brazilian presidency
of CPLP had as its main theme the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development. We
started our presidency of the community with
a meeting of the CPLP Network of Research
and Development in Health, dedicated to
combating malaria, tuberculosis and sexually
transmitted diseases. Technical cooperation
in health has also advanced on the bilateral
front. Brazil has helped build a laboratory
to diagnose tuberculosis in São Tomé and
Principe. Furthermore, it has established
human milk banks in Angola and Mozambique.
Another pillar of Brazilian collaboration
with Africa is science and technology. We
are pleased to announce the opening of a
training centre of the Brazilian aerospace
company Embraer in Johannesburg. With
state-of-the-art flight simulators, the centre
will train thousands of professionals every
year, coming from the entire region.
In our relations with Africa, there is
also vast potential in trade and economic
cooperation. The Common Market of the
South (Mercosur) is ready to negotiate the
expansion of its preferential trade agreement
with the Southern African Customs Union. In
September 2017, the Mercosur-Egypt Free
Trade Agreement entered into force. Mercosur
is also negotiating trade agreements with
Tunisia and Morocco. Moreover, Brazil has
signed investment agreements with Angola,
Ethiopia, Malawi and Mozambique – and
negotiations with other African countries are
underway. More trade and investment mean
more opportunities, more jobs and more
income to the benefit of our peoples.
BRICS as a group has also worked for
the economic development of Africa. The
New Development Bank opened its Regional
Office for Africa in Johannesburg in 2017.
This has already contributed to increase
the bank’s activities on the continent. More
than 380 million dollars have already been
channelled to projects in infrastructure and
renewable energy.
Our agenda with Africa also comprises the
crucial topic of promoting peace and security.
Brazil has a long tradition of participation in
United Nations peacekeeping operations. Our
personnel are currently serving in 10 missions,
five of them on the African continent. We are
well aware of the high importance of peace
and security for development. For this reason,
Brazil has advocated the establishment, at the
Johannesburg Summit, of the BRICS Working
Group on Peacekeeping.
As we prepare to assume the BRICS
Presidency in 2019, Brazil pledges to continue
working in favour of the group’s partnership
with Africa.
Our country is always seeking more
cooperation with Africa. This is our interest,
our desire, our commitment. Africa is part of
who we are.

BRICS-Africa Outreach and the
BRICS Plus initiative: A path
to inclusive development and
shared prosperity
I
n December 2010, South Africa joined the
Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC)
forum, thereby adding the “S” to the
acronym and officially forming BRICS.
With South Africa’s accession to BRICS,
the reach of this nascent trans-continental
formation, with a global projection that not only
brings together the Indian, Atlantic and Pacific
oceans, was expanded to five continents and
came to collectively represent more than
40% of the global population. Notably, these
countries committed to responding to the
clarion call of the 1955 Bandung Conference
for greater cooperation between and among
the countries of the Global South.
The year 2011 was also significant for the
adoption of the Sanya Declaration at the
Third BRICS Summit in Sanya, China. The
By HE Lindiwe Sisulu
Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Republic of South Africa
Sanya Declaration was a seminal expression
of the BRICS countries’ commitment to
global development and the broadening
of relations between developing countries.
BRICS Leaders committed themselves to
the Sanya Principles of “openness, solidarity
and mutual assistance”; which to this day
underpin the core intention of BRICS, to foster
inclusiveness and multilateralism to reflect the
global realities of the 21st century, notably with
regard to the reform of political and economic
global governance institutions and addressing
common challenges that impair development.
South Africa is honoured to host the
10th BRICS Summit in 2018, not only
because 2018 marks a decade of BRICS
cooperation at the highest diplomatic level
but also because in this year our country
commemorates the centenary of two of our
great struggle stalwarts, Nelson Mandela and
Albertina Sisulu. It is intended that our second
rotation at the helm of BRICS will build on
the first, through meaningful institutional
development, expanded sectoral cooperation
and a reflection and consolidation of BRICS
activities undertaken since 2008.
The South African struggle stalwart, Mama
Albertina Sisulu, dedicated her life to fight for
the emancipation of women and the liberation
of South Africa. We remember the sacrifices
women such as Albertina Sisulu made to
build a democratic society which respects and
celebrates the crucial role women play in all
walks of life.
“The strong foundations laid by both Madiba
and Ma Sisulu empower this generation to
press on to make society a better place to
live in,” said the Minister of Communications,
Nomvula Mokonyane. South Africans and
the international community will celebrate
the Mandela centenary under the theme “Be
the Legacy”. Minister Mokonyane said: “The
theme of this centenary means that each
person should emulate the true values that
Madiba upheld.”
One of the areas in which South Africa is
keenly interested in is further enjoining the
BRICS forum with the African continent. The
African Continent has from the onset pledged
its support to South Africa’s membership of
BRICS and it was incumbent on us to ensure
that we created a constructive mechanism
of dialogue and action between BRICS and
African countries.
On the occasion of the eThekwini Summit
in 2013, South Africa hosted the first
BRICS Outreach Dialogue, during which
African Leaders representing the regional
groupings, and the African Union (AU), as
well as the key development institutions of
our continent were invited to engage with
BRICS Leaders. The Africa Outreach was
held under the theme, “BRICS and Africa:
Partnership for Development, Integration
and Industrialisation”, and was a tangible
expression of the commitment made by
BRICS Leaders in the Sanya Declaration to:
“support infrastructure development in Africa
and its industrialisation”. The support provided
by fellow BRICS members is reflective of the
realisation that global development cannot
happen without Africa.
This support has not been merely
rhetorical, but it has found practical and
institutional expression as well. Key among
the more noteworthy of these results is the
establishment of the Africa Regional Centre
(ARC) of the New Development Bank (NDB),
BRICS-Africa Outreach and the BRICS Plus initiative: A path to inclusive development and shared prosperity
The African continent has from the onset pledged its support to South Africa’s
membership of BRICS and it was incumbent on us to ensure that we created
a constructive mechanism of dialogue and action between BRICS and African
countries.

which was first mooted by BRICS Leaders at
the time of South Africa’s Chairship in 2013.
Launched in Johannesburg, on 17 August
2017, the ARC is the first regional centre
to be established under the auspices of the
NDB, and is intended to play a catalytic role
in providing financial and project preparation
support for infrastructure and sustainable
development projects in South Africa and the
African continent, with an initial phase focus on
project preparation and facilitation. As we take
greater strides in developing our connections
for intra-regional trade, notably through the
Continental Free Trade Agreement, greater
infrastructure connectivity will be essential
to assist us in enabling and maximising
regional trade. The potential role of the ARC
will thus be critical here. We will continue this
legacy of development dialogue, notably by
focussing on BRICS' potential contribution to
the objectives as outlined in the continent’s
development plan, Agenda 2063.
This year, the following Leaders have been
invited to participate in the BRICS-Africa
Outreach Dialogue: Rwanda, as Chair of the
AU; Senegal, as Chair of the New Partnership
for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) Heads
of State and Government Implementation
Committee; Gabon, as the Chair of the
Economic Community of Central African
States; Uganda, as the Chair of the East
African Community; Ethiopia, as Chair of the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development
(IGAD); Togo, as Chair of the Economic
Community of West Africa States; Zambia, as
Chair of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA); and, given South
Africa’s concurrent Chairship of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC),
we have invited Namibia, as incoming Chair
of SADC and Angola, as Chair of the SADC
Organ. The other SADC countries were
also invited. Furthermore, we have invited
the Chairperson of the AU Commission, Mr
Moussa Faki Mahamat, as well as the heads
of the secretariats of the aforementioned
regional economic communities, the CEO
of the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating
Agency and the President of the African
Development Bank.
Subsequent to South Africa’s successful
introduction of the Africa Outreach, all
the BRICS members have since hosted
outreach initiatives on the margins of their
respective summits, inviting members (or a
representative selection of the membership)
of a formal regional organisation to which
they are affiliated, and which represents a
formation of the Global South.
The approach to the BRICS Outreach
was innovated further in 2017 when under
the Chinese Chairship the concept of a
BRICS Plus initiative was introduced.
The initiative was posited as a “Dialogue
with Emerging Markets and Developing
Countries” and represented an expression of
paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Sanya Declaration,
where Leaders expressed the intention
“to enhance the voice of emerging and
developing countries in international affairs
and strengthen cooperation for common
development”. The Chinese Foreign Minister,
His Excellency Mr Wang Yi, best captured
this sentiment when he eloquently noted
that, through the BRICS Plus initiative “We
will widen the circle of friends of the BRICS
and turn it into the most influential platform for
South-South cooperation in the world”.
From the onset of our membership of
BRICS, South Africa has advocated for the
inclusivity not only of the African continent
but also the Global South more broadly. As
a result, it is appropriate that our Chairship
embraces a dual approach to the Outreach
mechanism format by including the BRICS
Plus initiative in addition to the BRICS-Africa
Outreach.
The rationale behind the BRICS Plus
initiative is to promote a platform for greater
partnerships among countries of the Global
South to shape the agenda and to effect
changes in the global economy, notably
for: development and economic growth
through trade and investment integration and
cooperation in global governance financial,
economic and political institutions.
As the 2018 Chair of the BRICS forum and
host of the 10th BRICS Summit, South Africa
is seeking not only to fulfil the objectives
set out in the Sanya Declaration, but also to
realise the objectives expounded in the 1955
Bandung Conference by inviting countries of
the Global South to the second BRICS Plus
initiative.
The 2018 BRICS Plus initiative will include
countries currently chairing formations of
the South and representing various regions
around the globe. In this regard, South Africa
has elected to invite: Argentina, as the Chair
of the G20 and influential member of the
Common Market of the South; Indonesia, as
the Co-Chair of the New Africa-Asia Strategic
Partnership with South Africa and influential
Association of Southeast Asian Nations;
Egypt, as Chair of the Group of 77+China;
Jamaica, as the incoming Chair of the
Caribbean Community; Turkey, as the Chair
of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation;
as well as Mr Ant ónio Guterres, the United
Nations Secretary-General.
It is trusted that this conversation between
BRICS and these countries/entities will take
forward South-South solidarity, through a
dialogue that furthers collaboration on the
critical objectives of inclusive growth and
sustainable development.
The theme for the 10th BRICS Summit and
South Africa’s BRICS Chairship is: “BRICS
in Africa: Collaboration for Inclusive Growth
and Shared Prosperity in the 4 th Industrial
Revolution”. This theme reminds us that the
21st century, and indeed the approaching
Fourth Industrial Revolution, afford us both
opportunities and vested responsibilities to
address our common challenges.
The African continent and the Global South
cannot be left behind.
The BRICS forum is an important
mechanism through which cooperative
partnerships can, and will be strengthened so
that we may accomplish the objectives of an
open, inclusive and transparent global order
for shared prosperity.

A commitment to contributing to the
global communities in which we operate
Over the years, Naspers has witnessed countless examples
where innovation and entrepreneurial spirit came together
to solve unique local challenges and address big societal
needs. And as a global company, it recognises the
importance of making a positive economic and social
contribution to communities in which we operate.
Enriching the lives of South Africans
Off screen, more than 90 000 black South Africans have
benefitted from MultiChoice’s broad-based black economic
empowerment (BBBEE) share scheme, Phuthuma Nathi.
A R2 000 investment at scheme launch was worth close to
R25 000 in 2016, having yielded a total dividend of R10 000
over that period. The scheme has paid out almost R6.5
billion in dividends since inception, changing the lives of
thousands of shareholders. Media24’s BBBEE share scheme
Welkom Yizani further affords thousands of black South
Africans the opportunity to own 15% of the company.
For over 100 years Media24 has produced content through
its newspapers, magazines, books, digital media and
multimedia that has kept South Africans informed of the
world around them.  Voted the media company most
graduates aspire to work by more than 2 000 graduates,
Media24 remains committed to equality, diversity and
transformation. And when you consider that Media24’s
digital platforms have over 12 million daily page views, it’s
clear this is a company looking ahead to the next 100 years.
MultiChoice is not only the provider of world class
TV-programmes, movies, sport, news and documentaries
across the African continent, it is also one of the biggest
contributors to the growth of the South African film and
television industry.
T ogether with M-Net, it include one the largest funders of
local content in Africa and through SuperSport, the biggest
funder of sport on the continent. MultiChoice believes in
the youth of South Africa, and through its corporate social
investment and skills development programmes, helps
young people realize their potential in sport, broadcasting,
and film-making. Through its flagship corporate social
investment programme, Media24 equips young South
Africans with digital skills by teaching them how to
use digital technologies to research and produce news
and information.
As part of its commitment to empowering women,
MultiChoice has implemented a Leading Women
programme with the Gordon Institute of Business to
develop women at a middle to senior management level.
Other initiatives include internal leadership development
programs, a Women in Business Program (Wimbiz) and a
Women Empowerment Program with the Lagos Business
School.
A meaningful place to work
It can be tempting to think that only founders can be
entrepreneurial. Over the years, Naspers has come to
believe that entrepreneurial spirit is actually just a mindset,
and anyone can have it. And sometimes you can’t just simply
cross your fingers and hope it happens, you have to give it a
helping hand. Opening the lines of communication is a good
first step. Ensuring everyone in the business understands
the big picture is key – if teams don’t know what they’re
trying to achieve, it’s less likely they’ll focus their creativity
and efforts on the right things.
Giving people the freedom to think for themselves and
challenge the status quo is important. Not just in terms of
how things are done within the organisation, but also in
terms of what the organisation is doing for its stakeholders
and customers. Encouraging everyone to stay close to the
people they serve and fully understand what they are trying
to achieve can spark all sorts of innovative ideas.
Encouraging and listening to ideas from across the
organisation about every aspect of the organisation can
open up new sources of innovation. In short, creativity is
everyone’s job.
Naspers has created a compelling place to work where
people are engaged and motivated to achieve their full
potential. The company employs nearly 25 000 people
across the world in fully-owned andmanagement-controlled
businesses. In South Africa the company employs more than
15 000 people in MultiChoice, Media24 and Takealot, and
thousands more indirectly through MultiChoice’s network
of more than 1200 accredited installers and 120 DStv
agencies. MultiChoice also backs emerging entrepreneurs.
Its enterprise and supplier development programme offers
various forms of support to small businesses, including
loans, favourable supplier payment terms and trading
opportunities. This commitment to enterprise development
creates jobs and delivers economic growth, which
ultimately ensures social upliftment in local communities.
NASPERS
The first pivot came in 1985, when Naspers launched
M-Net, Africa’s first pay television channel. The M-Net vision
was forged by a group of energetic young entrepreneurs
with a dogged determination to transform the lives of
South Africa’s viewing public.
This vision would permanently change the face of local
broadcasting. Launched at a turbulent time in South African
history, many believed that the pivot into paid-for TV was a
daring experiment, perhaps even doomed to failure.
Decades later, MultiChoice produces and serves the best of
local and international content to millions of customers
across Africa. And continues to lead innovation in an
increasingly digital world.
The second pivot came in 2001, with the truly
transformational decision to invest in T encent, a fledgling
Chinese internet company.  T encent remains one of the
very best enterprises in the world and we therefore remain
firmly committed to the investment. Followed by an
investment in Mail.ru in 2006, these early bets in the new
world of online lead to a period of intense investment
beyond the shores of Africa and into exciting markets as
diverse as Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, and
the Middle East, and Asia.
T oday, Naspers companies and investments improve the lives
of hundreds of millions people in more than 120 countries
and markets across the world. They operate across print
and digital media, video entertainment (including the classic
pay TV model, digital terrestrial TV, and digital streaming)
and the internet, including marketplaces, online classifieds,
etail, travel, entertainment, payments and fintech, education
technology and food delivery. With nearly 20% of the
world’s population using the products and services of
companies Naspers has built and invested in, and many of
these customers using the products of more than one of its
companies, the group continues to look for innovative and
ambitious founders and businesses to back, particularly
those that address big societal needs.
The Naspers story
Innovating for a changing world
For over a century, Naspers has steadily grown from its
humble beginnings as a small newspaper publisher, by
investing in, acquiring and building leading companies with
sustainable competitive advantages.
T oday, Naspers is a global internet and entertainment group
and one of the largest technology investors in the world. But
the group stays true to its roots: it continues to back
innovative founders and businesses that it believes have the
potential to scale beyond their local market. Increasingly,
they address big societal needs using technology.
Naspers holds entrepreneurship at its heart. The group
constantly looks at the world around it, identifying the
changes and shifting trends it believes will shape the needs
and behaviours of both local communities and society at
large. In recent years, rapid technology innovation has
created and connected communities, enabled trade and
broken down borders, removed friction and added speed,
commoditised knowledge and delivered real-time news, and
of course entertained. In short it has played a key role in
empowering people and enriching communities. And in
todays connected world, the way people think, influence,
interact and live continues to evolve in unprecedented,
transformational ways.
Naspers was established in 1915 to produce a Dutch-language newspaper. From that starting point,
two pivotal moments – both leaps into brave new worlds – redefined the future of its business. Those
moments in time triggered the evolution from a print media business into a global internet and
entertainment group, and one of the largest technology investors in the world.

Increasing access to education
Recent investments by Naspers into education technologies
like Codeacademy, Udemy and Brainly are helping to
redefine how education is accessed and delivered across
the world. These innovative online platforms are opening
the doors to learning for millions of people who previously
did not have access to education around the world –
people who face many barriers that prevent them from
learning and developing their skills in traditional classroom
or university environments.
Efficient transportation
Another example of how innovation and entrepreneurial
spirit merge to solve unique local challenges and address a
big societal need is redBus in India. This innovative
transportation app keeps India moving by digitally
Solving complex and challenging
problems that face the world
aggregating the nation’s vast number of bus routes and
timetables from a wide array of operators. Before redBus,

lacked official bus stops. redBus helps people get to work
on time, visit relatives, and enjoy pastimes with far less
hassle.  And that’s not all.
In addition to timetable and route data, redBus also
aggregates information on the experience delivered by each
of the bus companies. Customers can use this information
in their ticket purchase decisions, but by making this
information visible in one place, redBus also enables India’s
various bus companies to see what their competitors offer.
The result is that all the companies raise their game,
ultimately benefiting society at large. Naspers is helping
Our entrepreneurs, at the forefront of innovative technology
redBus scale beyond India, with expansion into Latin
America, Malaysia and Singapore – regions it believes can
also benefit from the company’s leading-edge technology.
Giving youth access to the work place
SuperSport’s Let’s Play, part of MultiChoice, has
benefitted millions of school children in South Africa
through various physical education programmes for over
10 years. On top of this, the MultiChoice Diski Challenge
– the Premier Soccer League reserve league – has
opened up opportunities for young footballers aspiring
to professional careers, while providing a learning
platform for over 40 interns, who produce the
broadcasting of the matches on SuperSport and
community television stations.
Retraining workforce with new skills
Naspers launched its online and offline learning
environment, MyAcademy, in September 2016 specifically
NASPERS
for its staff around the world. This year, more than
20 000 group employees accessed content on
MyAcademy online. MyAcademy offers the very
best online learning content from global providers
such as Udemy, Big Think, Harvard Business School,
Codecademy, Ready, Vado, and Rosetta Stone.
Naspers’ MyAcademy classroom-based
programmes offer its people the opportunity to
grow their leadership skills regardless of where
they are in the world. The company also focus on
developing key functional skills in the areas of
technology, sales and business development, finance,
law and human resources. This year more than
1 500 people attended such programmes, and from

lectures and engaged in more than 43 000 hours
of training on the platform.

How an Argentinian entrepreneur
invested in India and is now leading a
classified innovation in the U.S.

When Alec co-founded OLX, he took what he
describes as the “Martian approach.” Most
entrepreneurs launch their business in their home
country– and city– because that’s what they know best.
But imagine you are a Martian looking down on the
world. As an unbiased extra-terrestrial, with no ties to
any particular region, you would take a different course.
Y ou would look at the whole world and choose the
optimal market to build your business. So despite being
Argentinian, Alec started with India.
Alec believes that people are far more similar around
the world than most realise: they may have different
day-to-day priorities and habits but, in the main,
virtually everyone is driven by the same motivations.
Chief among them is the desire to make life better for
themselves and their family. He believes OLX and let go
help people do this by enabling “wealth creation”,
making it easy to monetise personal possessions that
would otherwise sit unused, by selling them locally. But
his vision is bigger than creating successful, local trading
Helping local entrepreneurs scale their
businesses to compete in the global market
We identify, invest, and work with local entrepreneurs in order to
scale their businesses to the global market
Entrepreneurial spirit is the foundation of success at Naspers. And while we
believe entrepreneurial spirit is not the sole preserve of entrepreneurs –
anyone can have it – it is true that founders embody that spirit.  At Naspers
we’re fortunate that many of the founders of the businesses we have invested
in over the years remain part of our family, leading their companies through
the next waves of growth. Our founders are role models for our people across
the globe; they inspire us to not only have vision, but also innovate to take
calculated risks, and to push hard to pursue our dreams. It’s why we encourage
all our teams to act like founders. No founder embodies entrepreneurial spirit
more than Alec Oxenford.
Alec is the Argentinian co-founder of OLX and, more recently, Letgo, two
global classifieds businesses that we are proud to say are part of the Naspers

Our formula for success
Fostering innovation
As a society, we need to recognise the importance of
promoting innovation as a key driver of social change. As a
company, Naspers understands its importance, and
recognises and rewards the best examples from across the
group. The Naspers Innovation Awards recognise people or
teams who have made a significant, positive and measurable
impact on their customers through a great innovation,
usually product or technology based.
This year’s prizes went to teams from OLX India for
innovative solutions in intelligent messaging templates;
MultiChoice for big data competency used for insights and
recommendations by products like DStv Now, and
designing a new advertising architecture, unique in the
world, which allows MultiChoice to effectively monetise
content; and Irdeto’s research team who used machine
learning (ML) to automatically process and identify streams
distributed by pirate aggregation sites to our classifieds and
ecommerce platforms. Their efforts, and the efforts of
countless other dreamers, thinkers, entrepreneurs,
innovators, developers and doers are transforming the lives
we live every day. They are at the forefront of the charge to
address big societal needs through innovation and Naspers
celebrates their success.
Movile is the top mobile commerce platform in Latin
America, with over 100 million users per month. Movile
develops world-class mobile marketplaces and is a leader
in B2C mobile app-based services in Latin America
including iFood and Sympla. A leading self-service ticketing
platform in Brazil, Sympla is a one-stop-shop for
entertainment and events in Latin America. Movile is also
ramping up its content distribution. It is one of the largest
distributors of kids’ content digitally in the world.
iFood, a subsidiary of Movile is a leading online food
delivery platform in Latin America, fulfilling more than six
million orders per month. In Brazil, iFood is the preferred
destination for food delivery. Another way of bringing
technology to a very important part of people’s lives -
eating at home and at work.
Competing globally
Naspers knew it had to respond to the rapidly changing
television viewing habits seen elsewhere in the world.  The
associated rise of subscription video on demand (SVOD)
was gathering pace and, with continued improvements in
internet connectivity in Africa, it was only a matter of time
before new entrants brought this service to our markets. It
was a chance between being disrupted by others, or taking
the initiative and disrupting itself first. The company
decided on the latter and built a leading-edge SVOD
business in the full knowledge it could well cannibalise its
existing pay TV interests. Naspers took ShowMax from
idea to full launch in just six months.
ShowMax vouchers are now available in more than 500
different retail stores. South Africa’s four main banks also
allow the linking of ShowMax subscriptions with their
customer loyalty programmes. ShowMax also works in
partnership with mobile equipment manufacturers and
internet service providers like T elkom, who offer an
entertainment data bolt-on.
In its first 15 months, ShowMax achieved well over
10 million views or, put another way, more than 700 years
of continuous viewing if watched back-to-back. Creating
downloadable content, enabling customers to apply data
usage caps, establish a cash voucher system, and
implementing multiple user profiles are some of the
tougher technical challenges that had to be solved. Our
founders are role models for our people across the globe;
they inspire us to not only have vision, but also innovate
to take calculated risk, and to push hard to pursue
our dreams.

How an Argentinian entrepreneur
invested in India and is now leading a
classified innovation in the U.S.

When Alec co-founded OLX, he took what he
describes as the “Martian approach.” Most
entrepreneurs launch their business in their home
country– and city– because that’s what they know best.
But imagine you are a Martian looking down on the
world. As an unbiased extra-terrestrial, with no ties to
any particular region, you would take a different course.
Y ou would look at the whole world and choose the
optimal market to build your business. So despite being
Argentinian, Alec started with India.
Alec believes that people are far more similar around
the world than most realise: they may have different
day-to-day priorities and habits but, in the main,
virtually everyone is driven by the same motivations.
Chief among them is the desire to make life better for
themselves and their family. He believes OLX and let go
help people do this by enabling “wealth creation”,
making it easy to monetise personal possessions that
would otherwise sit unused, by selling them locally. But
his vision is bigger than creating successful, local trading

Entrepreneurial spirit is the foundation of success at Naspers. And while we
believe entrepreneurial spirit is not the sole preserve of entrepreneurs –
anyone can have it – it is true that founders embody that spirit.  At Naspers
we’re fortunate that many of the founders of the businesses we have invested
in over the years remain part of our family, leading their companies through
the next waves of growth. Our founders are role models for our people across
the globe; they inspire us to not only have vision, but also innovate to take
calculated risks, and to push hard to pursue our dreams. It’s why we encourage
all our teams to act like founders. No founder embodies entrepreneurial spirit
more than Alec Oxenford.
Alec is the Argentinian co-founder of OLX and, more recently, Letgo, two

BRICS: The next decade
By HE Aloysio Nunes Ferreira
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Brazil
T
he upcoming Johannesburg
Summit will inaugurate the
second decade of Brazil,
Russia, India, China and
South Africa (BRICS) – a
group of five large and diverse
emerging countries that defies labelling.
Indeed, the emergence before our eyes of
a complex multipolar world, whose contours
are still a “work in progress”, calls for new
approaches to analyse the international
scene. In this new emerging environment,
creating benchmarks, assessing results and
projecting expectations have proven to be
humbling tasks. Groundbreaking shifts on
the political, economic and social fronts,
both domestically and internationally, bear
testimony to that assessment.
Despite the complexities of navigating these
largely uncharted waters, BRICS coordination
has been thriving for a decade, with tangible
achievements to its credit as far as both joint
cooperation initiatives and global governance
reform are concerned.
BRICS achievements rest on a pragmatic
and exploratory approach to coordination
and cooperation, which is fully cognisant
In 2019, it will be Brazil’s honour to hold the presidency of BRICS. As it prepares
to take the baton from South Africa, Brazil looks forward to a new decade of
even more ambitious purposes, of even more ambitious results.

that we are a group of diverse countries with
different historical, geopolitical, social and
economic contexts and interests. Our aim
has never been to compete with or replace
existing institutions, but rather to improve
and complement them, making international
organisations more democratic and
responsive to our development needs.
Guided by this pragmatic, result-oriented
approach, the South African Chairship has
chosen as the theme for the 10th Summit:
“BRICS in Africa: Collaboration with
Developing Countries for Inclusive Growth
and Shared Prosperity in the 4th Industrial
Revolution”. It is a topic that allows us to revisit
past achievements while adopting a forward-
looking attitude. It invites us to discuss what
we can do better for the well-being of our
societies in a fast-changing world.
Chief among our achievements are
the group´s decisive contribution to the
International Monetary Fund’s quota
reform, and the establishment of the
New Development Bank (NDB) and the
Contingency Reserve Arrangement (CRA).
The implementation of the NDB, in particular,
will help meet the demand for financing of
sustainable infrastructure projects, as well
as foster joint ventures among our business
sectors. In less than four years, the NDB
has already approved projects amounting to
over US$5 billion in the five countries. After
the setting up of the Africa Regional Centre
in Johannesburg, Brazil looks forward to the
launching of the Americas Regional Office,
which will have its headquarters in São
Paulo. The new office will improve the NDB’s
operational capabilities in the country and
help identify and prepare new projects.
On the cooperation front, the group has
found rich potential in the common challenges
that the five members face as middle-income
countries, such as public health, education,
science, technology and innovation and
energy, among others. Cooperation in these
fields is starting to bear tangible fruits.
The summit also invites a reflection on
the future of multilateralism. BRICS has long
defended the need for a comprehensive
reform of the structure and working methods
of the United Nations (UN), including its
Security Council, with a view to making it
more representative, effective and efficient.
The reformed global governance BRICS has
always advocated will only materialise with a
UN that is overhauled to meet the challenges
of the 21st century. At this point, it is by and
large still stuck in the 20th century.
In the realm of international peace and
security, our five countries are leading
financial and troop contributors to UN
peacekeeping operations. Brazil looks forward
to the establishment, under the South African
Presidency, of the BRICS Working Group
on Peacekeeping, which will improve our
practical cooperation on issues such as pre-
deployment training, regional cooperation,
mandates and the use of intelligence.
  Another issue that will merit our Leaders’
attention in Johannesburg is sustainable
development. At the 10th Summit, BRICS
countries will have the opportunity to enhance
cooperation with a view to achieving the
full implementation of the 2030 Agenda.
Our Leaders have continuously reaffirmed
BRICS commitment to achieving sustainable
development in all its three dimensions –
economic, social and environmental – in a
balanced and integrated manner.
We stand on the brink of a technological
revolution that will alter the way we think
about economic growth and development –
and a BRICS partnership in this area certainly
has vast potential. The summit will offer
an opportunity to discuss how to promote
our competitive participation in the new
industrial revolution and in the global value
chains. In this regard, Brazil has welcomed
South Africa’s choice of the Fourth Industrial
Revolution as one of the main priorities of its
presidency.
In this common effort to prepare for a new
era of innovation, we should enhance our
BRICS cooperation in science and technology.
Brazil has proposed the establishment of
the BRICS Networks of Science Parks,
Technology Business Incubators and Small
and Medium-sized Enterprises. The networks
will help our countries take advantage of the
new industrial revolution to promote inclusive
development.
Health is perhaps the area in which
practical cooperation within BRICS has been
most successful – and one in which many
possibilities remain open. The Tuberculosis
Research Network, established in 2017,
provides a clear example of how BRICS
collaboration can have a real impact that
changes real lives . But we can and should
do more. Brazil is a strong supporter of
South Africa’s proposal to launch a Vaccine
Research Platform. Brazil also considers
that BRICS coordination in the World Health
Organisation has been very fruitful and should
continue.
The establishment of a Regional Aviation
Partnership is a milestone for our countries,
which share similar challenges and
opportunities in this field. It is no coincidence
that the Brazilian aeroplane manufacturer,
Embraer, is making significant investments
in South Africa. During the BRICS Summit,
the US$10-million Embraer Regional Training
Centre at Oliver Tambo International Airport
will be opened.
With state-of-the-art facilities, and six top-
notch flight simulators, the centre will train 2
000 professionals per year, including pilots,
engineers, mechanics and flight attendants
coming from the whole of Africa and the
Middle East.
Finally, Brazil welcomes the organisation
of “people-to-people” events, such as the
Business Forum, the Academic Forum,
the BRICS Games, the Cultural Festival
and the BRICS Film Festival. They all
contribute to the fundamental task of
improving mutual knowledge between
our countries. After all, civil society is
the ultimate beneficiary of our initiatives.
As we conclude our first 10 years, the
competent and effective South African
Chairship has helped shape our vision and
objectives for the next decade. In 2019, it will
be Brazil’s honour to hold the presidency of
BRICS. As it prepares to take the baton from
South Africa, Brazil looks forward to a new
decade of even more ambitious purposes, of
even more ambitious results.

BRICS return to Africa
By HE Sergey Lavrov
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia
I
t is highly symbolic that Brazil, Russia,
India, China and South Africa (BRICS) is
returning to Africa in the year 2018, which
marks the 100th anniversary of the birth
of Nelson Mandela, a prominent political
and public figure of a global scale. A true
son of the South African nation, he dedicated
all his life to the fight against apartheid and
rightfully became a key figure in the national
reconciliation process in South Africa. We
will always be grateful to him for his great
personal contribution to the establishment of
friendly relations between our two countries
that have now reached a high level of a
comprehensive strategic partnership. Our
group is a unique example of building
partnerships between states that differ greatly
in terms of culture and civilization. And this
is exactly why it is so strong and united. The
cooperation between the five countries is
based on mutual respect and mutual benefit,
as well as strict consideration of each other’s
interests. BRICS countries represent a major
stabilising factor, promoting sound multilateral
initiatives in global affairs.
I am convinced that BRICS can be proud
of the fact that it is a successor in interstate
relations of the wise Madiba’s work. The five
countries advance the same principles that
Nelson Mandela stood up for – equality, dignity
and justice – when forming constructive and
equitable polycentric patterns of international
relations.
We welcome the active and highly effective
work done by South Africa at the helm of
the group in 2018. Led by Pretoria, our
countries managed to significantly enhance
the multifaceted strategic partnership, make
qualitative and quantitative leaps in all three
major pillars of intra-BRICS cooperation:
policy and security, economy and finance,
culture and humanitarian exchanges. Our
South African friends have succeeded
in strengthening successive, consistent,
sustainable and continuous interaction
between the five states. This serves as a
foundation for the steady development of
BRICS.
Russia supports fully BRICS priority areas
of action proposed by South Africa for this
year. The cross-cutting issue of the Chairship –
launching partnership on the Fourth Industrial
Revolution – is of high relevance for us since
it is in line with Russia’s state programmes on
digital economy development.
We welcome special attention paid by
Pretoria to Africa-related issues in the work
of BRICS. This area of work is becoming
increasingly important for Russian foreign
policy as well. Russia has significantly
contributed to decolonisation processes and
the rise of new independent states on the
continent. We support further strengthening
of the sovereignty of African countries,
their independent choice of the way of
development while preserving national
We welcome the decision of the BRICS Chair to invite to Johannesburg other
friends of the five countries from around the world representing authoritative

distinctiveness. Sub-Saharan Africa is the
most dynamically developing region of the
planet, which plays a key role in world mineral
and hydrocarbon markets, a broad and rapid-
growing consumer market and one of the
most attractive investment areas.
The BRICS-Africa Partnership that was
launched during South Africa’s 2013 BRICS
Chairship is steadily developing. During the
Johannesburg Summit, a special outreach
session will be held with the participation of
the Heads of States presiding over regional
organisations of the continent in order to
focus on its most relevant issues.
We welcome the decision of the BRICS
Chair to invite to Johannesburg other
friends of the five countries from around
the world representing authoritative
integration associations. This is the practical
implementation of the “BRICS Plus” initiative
approved by our Leaders during the Xiamen
Summit. Thus, we expand the global reach of
the group and establish the outer circle of like-
minded countries. In this regard, BRICS has
good potential to become a unique platform
for linking various integration processes in a
flexible way.
The attractiveness of the “Big Five” to
third countries is explained by the fact that
they are open to constructive cooperation
and share universal values. I am referring
to the impeccable respect for the United
Nations (UN) Charter and basic principles of
international law, including sovereign equality
of states, commitment to the UN central role
and indivisibility of security. We do not accept
double standards, military interventions,
unilateral coercive economic measures,
protectionism and unfair competition. We
stand in solidarity that the use of military
force to solve international problems is
unacceptable. We defend the foundations of
an open, inclusive, equitable, transparent and
mutually beneficial multilateral trade system
with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at
its core.
Russia consistently advocates a greater
coordination of the five BRICS countries
within major international platforms, such as
the UN, G20, WTO, International Monetary
Fund, World Bank, as well as other multilateral
organisations and fora. When the states of the
group speak up in a strong and unified voice
about the core issues of global politics and
economy, this voice is heard by other states
as well. Consolidation of our efforts is a key
to ensuring world stability and a way to settle
serious conflicts.
BRICS successfully promotes cooperation
in international politics, in particular on
such issues as terrorism, drug threats
and non-proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction. Russia pays particular attention
to strengthening cooperation in international
information security, including the
development of a relevant intergovernmental
agreement between the five countries.
Our country aims to increase joint efforts
with partners against the use of information
and communications technology for terrorist
or other unlawful purposes. BRICS economic
and financial cooperation remains the most
active area of development. Over the past two
years, significant progress has been made in
the establishment of the fully operational New
Development Bank (NDB). The pipeline of
approved investment projects in the BRICS
countries is now close to US$5 billion and can
exceed US$18 billion by 2021. We expect that
the NDB Africa Regional Centre, established
last year, will make an important contribution
to financing initiatives in South Africa.
Among other economic achievements of the
five BRICS countries, it is worth mentioning
the establishment of the mechanism of the
BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement and
the launch of a practical dialogue on mutual
payments in national currencies. We expect
that new initiatives to enhance interaction
in the field of energy research and female
entrepreneurship will also be made, adding
value to the practical results of South Africa’s
Chairship.
Interaction within the so-called “third
basket” of intra-BRICS cooperation,
which includes humanitarian issues, looks
promising. South Africa gives priority to this
area. The work to implement the Agreement
between the Governments of the BRICS
States on Cooperation in the Field of Culture
and the Action Plan to promote practical
cultural interaction is underway. The BRICS
Games, Film Festival, civil and academic fora,
and events with the participation of young
diplomats, scientists and representatives of
the friendship cities have taken place so far
this year.
We note that the Johannesburg Summit
is properly prepared and has an intense
programme. We are confident in its success.
We expect that it will have a special
“milestone” character. The anniversary
meeting of the Leaders is intended not only
to confirm the BRICS countries’ commitment
to further strengthening of the full-fledged
strategic partnership, but also to determine
the key priorities of the “Big Five” activities for
years to come.
BRICS economic and
financial cooperation
remains the most
active area of
development. Over
the past two years,
significant progress
has been made in the
establishment of the

he upcoming Johannesburg
Summit will be the 10th
summit of BRICS countries.
It will take place again on the
vast African continent with
South Africa, the beautiful
rainbow nation, as the host. The meeting
is important and will have far-reaching
significance as President Xi Jinping and other
participating leaders will jointly discuss plans
for the future development of BRICS and
South-South cooperation.
In a world of major development,
transformation and adjustment, BRICS was
founded as a response to the call of the age,
and has since grown from strength to strength
amid a changing international landscape,
benefiting its five members and the world
over. It has now developed into a South-South
cooperation platform with global influence,
making a remarkable contribution to the
economic growth, governance reform, peace
and stability of the world.
Like a vibrant river that keeps running
forward, BRICS cooperation builds on a
strong past, gains strength along its course
and flows to a bright future. At the successful
Xiamen Summit presided over by President
Xi Jinping last September, the five leaders
agreed to forge a closer, broader and more
comprehensive strategic partnership. They
reinforced the cooperation framework in three
key areas, namely economy and finance,
political and security and people-to-people
exchanges, and adopted the BRICS Plus
approach, ushering in the second golden
decade of BRICS cooperation.
At the Xiamen Summit, President Xi
highlighted three important practices to be
carried forward in BRICS cooperation: first,
treating each other as equals and seeking
common ground while reserving differences;
second, taking a results-oriented, innovative

approach to make our cooperation benefit all;
third, developing ourselves to help others with
the well-being of the world in our mind. This is
what the BRICS spirit is all about. It reflects
the value of BRICS partnership and distinct
features of the BRICS mechanism. Defined by
such value and features, BRICS cooperation
has gained endorsement and support from
other countries, emerging markets and
developing countries in particular, and BRICS
has become a positive, enterprising and
constructive force in international affairs.
The world is faced with changes unseen
in a century. Global economic recovery is
gaining momentum. The Fourth Industrial
Revolution is nurturing new growth drivers.
And emerging markets and developing
countries are powering an unstoppable trend
of development. That said, however, the
rising unilateralism, protectionism, Cold War
mentality and zero-sum game thinking have
added uncertainties and destabilising factors
to the international situation.
Faced with unprecedented opportunities
and challenges, China wants to work with
South African Chairship and other members
to keep BRICS cooperation in the right
direction with a broader strategic vision and
a stronger sense of responsibility. We want
to create wider development space for all
emerging markets and developing countries
and build a more balanced global governance
system that embodies the will and interests of
the greatest majority of countries.
Deepening economic cooperation to
energise development
Practical cooperation lays the groundwork
for BRICS cooperation. China commends the
efforts by South Africa to prioritise the Fourth
Industrial Revolution and inclusive growth. It
is important for us to keep abreast of the trend
of the times, devote ourselves to reform and
innovation with a keen sense of urgency, and
facilitate the process of industrialisation and
economic transformation of BRICS countries
through the Partnership on New Industrial
Revolution (PartNIR). We need to ensure the
smooth progress of the New Development
Bank, a flagship project in BRICS cooperation,
and support the early operation of its African
Regional Centre to lend fresh impetus to
infrastructure and sustainable development
in Africa. Efforts should also be made to
enhance macroeconomic policy coordination
and synergise development strategies, step
up cooperation in trade and investment
liberalisation and facilitation, e-commerce,
public private partnership, local currency bond
market, and infrastructure connectivity. In this
way, we will be able to make new progress
toward the goal of a big market for trade and
investment, closer monetary and financial
cooperation, and greater infrastructure
connectivity.
Strengthening strategic coordination to
make the voices of BRICS heard
In this world of uncertainties, BRICS
cooperation reflects the aspirations of
emerging markets and developing countries
and embodies their endeavours to build a
better world. It is important for us to unite
together and closely cooperate at the
UN, the WTO and the G20, firmly support
multilateralism, respect each other, treat
each other as equals, explicitly oppose
unilateralism, protectionism, and reject the
practices of the big and strong bullying the
small and weak. Thus we will be able to
uphold the common interests and space
for development of emerging markets and
developing countries. Efforts should also
be made to make full use of mechanisms
such as the Foreign Ministers Meeting,
Meeting of National Security Advisers, and

regular consultations among our permanent

voice on multilateralism, global governance,
counter-terrorism, peace-keeping,
cybersecurity and other major issues. We
want to foster a new type of international
relations featuring mutual respect, fairness,
justice and win-win cooperation.
Promoting people-to-people exchanges
to solidify the foundation for cooperation
BRICS countries, known for their rich cultural
heritages, have made people-to-people
exchanges the third pillar of cooperation
at the Xiamen Summit, opening a new
chapter in BRICS cultural exchanges. Going
forward, we will continue to enhance amity
and communication between our peoples
by supporting friendly exchanges in diverse
forms. A variety of events, such as the Film
Festival, Cultural Festival, the BRICS Games
and co-production of film, will deepen BRICS
cooperation and get more people involved,
building increasing public support for BRICS
cooperation.
Strengthening outreach dialogue to
expand the partnership
Since its inception, the BRICS cooperation
mechanism has been tied closely to the
development of the emerging market and
developing countries.
Five years ago, South Africa brought
African leaders and BRICS Leaders together
in Durban for their first dialogue, enlarging
BRICS’ circle of friends. Under the Chairship
of South Africa this year, BRICS countries
have made progress once again in the
cooperation with other emerging market and
developing countries, as we focus on Africa in
the context of developing a global partnership.
This will enhance the BRICS Plus
cooperation approach adopted at the Xiamen
Summit, boost the development of the African
continent and facilitate the South-South
cooperation across the globe. China will hold
the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-
Africa Cooperation in September. We hope
these two summits will reinforce each other
and promote the development and prosperity
of African countries.
2018 marks the 100th anniversary of
the birth of Mr Nelson Mandela. This great
statesman once said, “It always seems
impossible until it’s done”.
There is also an old Chinese saying that
“Those who have a strong will get things
done”. Let us join hands and work together to
write a new chapter of BRICS cooperation in
Johannesburg in the new era.
In a world of major
development,
transformation and
adjustment, BRICS was

to the call of the age, and

T
he Republic of South Africa
first hosted a Summit of the
BRICS Forum in 2013, in
Durban, two years after we
joined this eminent platform
of emerging markets and
developing countries. Since its inception,
BRICS’s performance has gone from strength
to strength and has surpassed the initial
expectations of members and observers
alike.
The marking of a decade of cooperation at
the level of Heads of State and Government
(i.e. summits) is thus an important aspect of
the South African Chairship in 2018, and we
intend to use the 10th BRICS Summit to chart
the path for the next chapter of meaningful
and impactful BRICS cooperation.
As a member, and in pursuit of national and
regional objectives, South Africa intends to
maximise its Chairship of BRICS in 2018 to
derive tangible cooperation results for our
partners, our continent and the developing
community more broadly. In particular, this
cooperation should allow us all to better
navigate the transition into the Fourth
Industrial Revolution, and to benefit from
shared prosperity in this new reality, rather
than to be overwhelmed by its effects.
Our objectives during our first tenure of
Presidency were modest but emphatic in
their intention to contribute to the institutional
agenda of the BRICS forum. The platforms
that we proposed in 2013, including the
BRICS Think Tanks Council and the BRICS
Business Council have gained traction and
have been fully embraced and strengthened
Making space for new
areas and ways of
cooperation
Professor Anil Sooklal
South African BRICS Sherpa and DDG: Asia and Middle East Department of International Relations and Cooperation
by the efforts of all members over the years.
These have become positive platforms of
knowledge generation and sharing, as well
as for the formulation of responsive answers
to the questions posed to us by the unfolding
modern realities.
Furthermore, the New Development
Bank (NDB) truly took form in 2013, in the
discussions under South Africa’s Chairship.
Along with the Contingent Reserve
Arrangement, these are considered the
flagship institutions of BRICS cooperation.
Our theme in 2013 namely, “BRICS
and Africa: Partnership for Development,
Integration and Industrialisation”, articulated
an objective that we still hold as imperative
today; that being, to use our participation
in BRICS to enjoin BRICS and Africa in
development cooperation and to advocate for
the support of BRICS members for Africa and
its endogenous regional policy objectives.
Of course, we began weaving the African
Agenda into BRICS declarations as soon
as we joined the forum at the 2011 Sanya
Summit. However, it was important to ensure
that the sentimental support was buttressed
by a practical and tangible articulation of this
support.
Thus, subsequent to our arranging an
Outreach Dialogue between African and
BRICS Leaders in 2013, the BRICS Leaders
mandated that the first regional centre
of the NDB would be in Africa and would
be established concurrently to the NDB
headquarters. South Africa is delighted
to have delivered on the mandate given
to us by our African partners. The Africa
Regional Centre was launched in August
2017 and, although at a nascent stage, it has
commenced its work and has credible plans in
place to facilitate infrastructure and industrial
development projects on the continent.
South Africa was the first to initiate these
outreach dialogues and our BRICS partners
have all given momentum to this initiative
through the outreach summits they have
respectively hosted since 2013. We will
bring this initiative full circle this year, when
President Cyril Ramaphosa again hosts
the BRICS-Africa Outreach, during the 10th
BRICS Summit. Additional to this, we have
invited representative leaders from the Global
South for an interaction in the BRICS Plus
format.
As much as the agenda of BRICS is driven
by consensus, South Africa on its part is
pleased to have made notable and valuable
contributions over the years. South Africa’s
current Presidency, as with those of our
partners in the past, has been anchored in
two approaches, namely ensuring continuity
for the projects and programmes that are
in place, and carrying those successfully
forward; while keeping innovation in mind
and making space for new areas and ways
of cooperation.
This means that, during our Chairship,
we will preside over an annual calendar of
events that comprises more than 100 sectoral
meetings. In this regard, the meetings of
the BRICS Sherpas and Sous-Sherpas are
particularly valuable, as they provide the first
point of consultation among our countries
and are instrumental in building consensus
Making space for new areas and ways of cooperation
South Africa is honoured and takes seriously its responsibilities as Chair

Mandela in our efforts.

around ideas that subsequently become
BRICS projects and programmes.
Thus far, we have hosted four meetings
of the BRICS Sherpas and Sous-Sherpas in
the Western Cape, Limpopo and Gauteng,
respectively. These meetings not only gave
our partners unique and multi-dimensional
offerings of our country but, more importantly,
we caucused our key Chairship deliverables
and proposals, which received resounding
support. These include: the establishment
of a BRICS Vaccine Research Centre; a
BRICS Peacekeeping Working Group; a
BRICS Women’s Forum; BRICS Tourism
Cooperation; and leveraging the Strategy for
BRICS Economic Partnership towards the
pursuit of inclusive growth and advancing
the Fourth Industrial Revolution. All of these
represent an effort to provide responses
to challenges and realities in the political,
economic and social spheres.
In addition to the Sherpas’ meetings, we
have hosted various high-level engagements
and ministerial meetings. These include, but
are not limited to, an Anti-Corruption Working
Group Meeting (February 2018); the 17th
Meeting of the Contact Group on Economic
and Trade Issues (February 2018); the Ninth
Technical National Statistics Offices (March
2018); Counter-Terrorism Working Group
(April 2018); Security in the Use of ICTs
(May 2018); Meeting of BRICS Environment
Ministers (May 2018); and the Meeting of the
Energy Working Group (May 2018).
Furthermore, the BRICS Ministers of
Foreign Affairs/International Relations met
on 4 June 2018. The ministers’ discussions
reinforced the core values that brought BRICS
countries together – including the safe-
guarding of the United Nations and its Charter
and upholding multilateral cooperation. In the
face of the current global realities, including
the turn by some international players towards
unilateralism and protectionism, these values
have become even more important and
BRICS must lead the way in their protection
and further entrenchment. A global world
order that is based on equity and fairness
depends on this. The Ministers’ Meeting was
equally demonstrative of the manner in which
the BRICS countries are, and must continue
to be, responsive to global developments and
realities as they unfold.
The BRICS Envoys (Deputy Ministers) on
the Middle East and North Africa met from
20 to 21 June and similarly grappled with
burgeoning international crises in this complex
region, and forging BRICS consensus in
responding to these.
These meetings, and those to come, are
laying the path to the 10th BRICS Summit
and constitute the sectoral backbone of the
upcoming meetings of the BRICS Leaders.
Further meetings will be held throughout the
year, until the conclusion of the South African
Chairship in December.
Currently, in addition to being seized with
their sectoral work, South African national
departments and stakeholders are in the
process of consolidating the Johannesburg
Summit Declaration, which will be a
comprehensive and reflective outcomes
document.
The declaration will speak to the key issues
that we are driving this year, particularly the
Fourth Industrial Revolution, and of the areas
of shared importance for BRICS countries. As
always, BRICS will consider the international
realities and endeavour to collectively
respond to those.
South Africa is honoured and takes
seriously its responsibilities as Chair of
BRICS. We look forward to welcoming the
Leaders and delegates of BRICS, Africa
and other emerging markets and developing
countries to South Africa in July; and to
continuing the legacy and spirit of Nelson
Mandela in our efforts.

By Kundapur Vaman (KV) Kamath
President of the BRICS New Development Bank
I
n 2017, we continued to build strong
momentum in our operations and
strengthen our institutional foundations in
all functional areas.
Six projects aggregating over
US$1,8 billion were approved by the
Board in 2017. The total amount approved
since inception was US$3,4 billion at the
end of 2017. In addition, certain projects of
about US$900 million were appraised but
were not put up for Board consideration, as
we await necessary government approvals.
All of these projects focussed on improving
sustainability and addressed some of the
critical developmental needs of our member
countries.
These projects go beyond the core
renewable energy sectors that we earlier
focussed on in areas such as ecosystem
restoration, water supply, irrigation system
restructuring and energy conservation,
reflecting our ability to appraise increasingly
complex projects as we continue to move up
the learning curve.
The Africa Regional Centre (ARC), based
in South Africa, opened for business last year.
The ARC will be lean and initially tasked with
project identification and project preparation
for the New Development Bank (NDB). It will
serve as the bank’s interface for governments,
private-sector entities, financial institutions
and project preparation agencies as we scale
up our operations in South Africa. The ARC
will serve as a focal point for the NDB in
Africa and gradually help expand the bank’s
footprint on the continent.
In September 2017, we formalised the
Project Preparation Fund (PPF). The PPF is a
contributory multi-country fund that will enable
infrastructure and sustainable development
projects to be better prepared, so that they
can attract financing more easily. The PPF will
enhance the project preparation capacity of
member countries, facilitate feasibility studies
where necessary and support improved
project implementation. The emphasis will be
on leveraging local expertise.
Our members continue to demonstrate
strong support for the NDB by timely, and
in some cases, advance payment of equity
capital. By May 2018, we had received
US$4,1 billion in capital contributions, with
Russia and China already having paid their
2019 commitments.
In September last year, we had the
groundbreaking ceremony of our permanent
headquarters. The construction of the building
is now in full swing. We expect to move in by
2021. In line with the bank’s sustainability
mandate, the building has been designed
to be environmentally friendly, ensure a
healthy working space for its occupants and
involve low maintenance costs. Our new
headquarters will contribute to Shanghai’s
emphasis on green buildings, while also
contributing architecturally to the skyline of
Shanghai.
The current development context
We stand today at the dawn of a new industrial
revolution where technology-led disruption is
transforming the way we perceive products,
services and our physical space.
At the same time, the benefits of an
infrastructure-investment-led growth model
on job creation and poverty alleviation are
well documented. But the scope of this
infrastructure investment is changing fast,
with technology disrupting infrastructure
design.
Take for example bike-sharing. Bike-sharing
provides convenience to its customers by
offering “the perfect last-kilometre solution”.
Such solutions, combined with ride-hailing
The biggest economic opportunity today is that we can invest in a new
generation of smart and sustainable technologies to meet our infrastructure
requirements. We will leverage these transformations and promote knowledge
flows to support appropriate and effective solutions in our member countries.

technologies, reduce overall trips, as fewer
people individually drive to work. Reduced
overall trips means less road and parking
space is required. Additional urban space
opens up, including, possibly for green belts.
Another example of a disruptive technology
is that of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous
vehicles can be on the road longer, travel
further, and, potentially, more safely. In
a few years’ time, as more cars become
autonomous, public transport networks may
need to be realigned to this new pattern of
transportation.
This will fundamentally change the way
roads, bridges and parking systems are
designed and built.
Smart grids, green buildings, large-
scale off-grid systems, hyper-loops and
underground roadways have the potential
to advance rapidly in conjunction with the
ongoing innovations in network connectivity
and bandwidth. These developments will have
a material impact on how we perceive and
think about infrastructure. The infrastructure
that we need to build today, for use over
the next several decades, is fundamentally
different from what we built in the past.
It is also becoming increasingly apparent
that the impact of technology from artificial
intelligence (AI) to block-chain to fifth
generation (5G) networks will completely
revolutionise approaches to economic
development and service delivery. Early signs
of this emerging trend are visible in Shanghai,
where technology is transforming the city into
a smarter, greener and even more sustainable
city. “Conventional wisdom” clearly needs to
be redefined.
We, at the NDB, are conscious of these
ongoing transformations and we will align our
activities and processes taking these shifts
into account. We will act swiftly, be agile
and leverage technology in everything we
do. The NDB is determined to go beyond a
short-term, purely economics-based focus
for infrastructure development to a longer-
term, broader assessment of its economic,
environmental, social, and climate change
impact. The NDB’s first batch of projects were
all in the renewable energy sector. This was
more than a symbolic gesture; it conveyed
the message of the founders that we are
committed to a better and more sustainable
future for our member countries. We are now
focussing not only on renewables, but also on
projects which aim at undoing the damage
done to the environment during earlier growth
phases of some of our members. Sustainable
infrastructure will make up about two-thirds of
the NDB’s total projects.
In 2018, so far, we have approved projects
aggregating over US$1,7 billion out of our
target of US$4 to US$4,5 billion for the year.
We are striving to have a balanced portfolio
across our member countries. By the end of
this year, our project approval book should be
about US$7,5 to US$8 billion.
Besides the traditional set of lending
products, we will also begin offering non-fund-
based financial products like guarantees and
credit enhancements.
We will increase the scale and scope of
our ARC and operationalise the Americas
Regional Office in Brazil and the PPF.
On the funding side, we will continue to
explore opportunities in the local capital
markets of our members as well as global
capital markets. We will strive to maintain a
balance between pursuing a conservative
approach to institutional growth so as to obtain
and maintain the highest possible credit rating
and addressing our borrowers’ needs, both in
local and foreign currency.
Since the beginning, getting the right
staff in place has been a priority for us. Our
recruitment strategy is based on the principles
of meritocracy and gender-neutrality and
takes into consideration the landscape we
operate in. Our current staff strength is about
115 professionals, which is estimated to
increase to 210 by this year end. We believe
that blending the energy and vigour of youth
with the wisdom of seasoned professionals
is the correct approach in keeping the
organisation agile and nimble in the dynamic
global development landscape.
The biggest economic opportunity today
is that we can invest in a new generation of
smart and sustainable technologies to meet
our infrastructure requirements. We will
leverage these transformations and promote
knowledge flows to support appropriate and
effective solutions in our member countries.
By doing so, we will contribute to sustainable
development and poverty alleviation. As we
do so, we at the NDB will continue to listen, to
learn and to innovate.
This is an extract of Mr Kamath’s address at the Third Annual
Meeting of the New Development Bank, Shanghai, China, on
28 May 2018
At the Fourth BRICS Summit in New Delhi in 2012,
the Leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and
South Africa considered the possibility of setting
up a new development bank to mobilise resources
for infrastructure and sustainable development
projects in BRICS members and other emerging
economies, as well as in developing countries.
They directed finance ministers to examine the
feasibility and viability of this initiative, to set up a
joint working group for further study and to report
back by the next summit in 2013.
Following the report from the finance ministers
at the Fifth BRICS Summit in Durban in 2013, the
Leaders agreed on the feasibility of establishing
the New Development Bank (NDB) and made the
decision to do so. It was also agreed that the initial
contribution to the bank should be substantial
and sufficient for it to be effective in financing
infrastructure. During the Sixth BRICS Summit
in Fortaleza in 2014, the Leaders signed the
Agreement establishing the NDB.
In the Fortaleza Declaration, the Leaders
stressed that the NDB would strengthen
cooperation among BRICS members and would
supplement the efforts of multilateral and regional
financial institutions for global development,
thus contributing to collective commitments for
achieving the goal of strong, sustainable and
balanced growth.
“The Bank shall have an initial authorized
capital of US$100 billion. The initial subscribed
capital shall be US$50 billion, equally shared
among founding members. The first chair of the
Board of Governors shall be from Russia. The
first chair of the Board of Directors shall be from
Brazil. The first President of the Bank shall be
from India. The headquarters of the Bank shall be
located in Shanghai. The New Development Bank
Africa Regional Center shall be established in
South Africa concurrently with the headquarters.”
(Fortaleza Declaration)
The inaugural meeting of the Board of
Governors of the NDB was chaired by Russia and
held on the eve of the Ufa Summit on 7 July 2015,
when the bank formally came into existence as a
legal entity. During the meeting, the appointment of
the President, Mr KV Kamath, as well as four vice
presidents and the Board of Directors took place.
At the signing of the Headquarters Agreement
with the Government of the People’s Republic of
China and the Memorandum of Understanding
with the Shanghai Municipal People’s Government
on 27 February 2016, the NDB became fully
operational.
In 2016/17, the Board of Directors of the Bank
approved loans involving financial assistance of
over US$3,4 billion for projects in the areas of
green and renewable energy, transportation, water
sanitation, irrigation and other areas.

Envisioning inclusive

W
e regard the role
of the Think Tanks
Council of Brazil,
Russia, India, China
and South Africa
(BRICS) as critical to
contributing to the achievement of the stated
goals of the BRICS partnership.
The decision several years ago to
establish both the academic forum and the
collaboration of think tanks was a welcome
recognition of the contribution that research
and policy advice should play in influencing
development. BRICS has become an
important bloc in global politics, but there is a
great deal we need to do to translate the bloc
into one that has the capacity and knowledge
that support it to impact on and shape world
affairs.
Beyond focussing on our partnership,
concerted effort has been directed at finding
a means of ensuring that the rich portfolio of
resources, capacities and expertise brought
together in BRICS is used effectively to
support the development agenda of Africa
and of other BRICS regions that require
development support. This strategic
imperative is supported by all BRICS partner
governments.
South Africa has shown practical
commitment to contributing to the
development priorities of the continent as set
out in Agenda 2063 of the African Union as
well as the regional agenda of the Southern
African Development Community.
As part of the knowledge-generating
community, we live in uncertain times. A time
in which knowledge and truth are threatened
not just by those who are very powerful and
wealthy, but also by those who have been so
marginalised in our world that the opportunities
offered by knowledge are regarded as an
irrelevant and distant stranger. Our think
tanks need to reflect on these developments
and provide advice on how they should be
approached by policymakers and by BRICS.
The BRICS partnership offers an alternative
model of global friendship and solidarity. It
needs to articulate a more optimistic and
a more resolute narrative of inclusion and
progressive values, a narrative that commits
to addressing the needs and interest of the
most vulnerable, a narrative that suggests
the possibility of a bloc that can redress the
imbalances that confront so many millions in
our communities and the world broadly.
The partnership programmes the BRICS
nations have developed indicate that we
know what must be done. When BRICS was
first established, the key areas of cooperation
tended to be largely economic, with a focus
on international trade and global governance.
Reform of multilateral institutions such as the
International Monetary Fund, World Bank and
the United Nations Security Council was key
on our agenda. These remain as areas we
must address.
However, we have recognised the need
to elaborate a broader agenda and have
done so. Our agenda includes issues ranging
from agriculture, health, education, energy,
science and technology, academic exchange
and many others. We must ensure though
that this list contributes to real change and
not increased dialogue.
We believe the think tanks facility
establishes a strategic platform for designing
initiatives that will signal a collaborative
approach to knowledge creation, research
and the development of concrete advice on
solutions. It will be vital that the ideological
philosophy that informs our knowledge
generation is progressive and oriented to
people development, justice and democracy.
Linked to this, we also need to factor in
the important task of creating a new body
of talented young people able to lead think
tanks and fully appreciative of the need for
progressive and responsive concepts and
ideas.
When the BRICS Leaders met in Sanya in
2011, and later in New Delhi in 2012, there
was consensus that for the BRICS initiative to
succeed, it must have its own body of experts
and a think tanks formation that would guide
policymaking and development trajectories
for BRICS as a collective as well as for
individual member countries. The stated
expectation of our Leaders in launching the
BRICS Think Tanks Council was to have a
capacity that would be a reservoir of ideas for
BRICS leaders. Much has been achieved by
the Think Tanks Council since its formation
in 2013. The 10th year of the BRICS Summit
provides a unique opportunity for the council
The decision several years ago to establish both the academic
forum and the collaboration of think tanks was a welcome
recognition of the contribution that research and policy advice
should play in influencing development.

and the Academic Forum to take stock and
reflect on achievements and impacts in their
first five years. This will also allow you to
determine matters on which you may wish
to interact with ministers of education and
research and possibly BRICS heads of state
on think tank matters.
It is vital to have the following questions
answered? Have we achieved all we
wanted to? Has our work had any impact on
decisions taken by BRICS Leaders? What
happens to the papers that we publish from
our meetings?
One of the inadequacies in many of
our countries is short-term policy thinking.
We need to think long term and plan long
term and if capacity for this is lacking we
must ensure it is created. The 2015 Long-
Term Strategy document of the Think
Tanks Council included a focus on peace
and security; health and education; social
justice and sustainable development; and
inclusive growth. All of these continue to be
important for BRICS and we must generate
sufficient knowledge in these to guide policy
interventions.
South Africa has decided to ensure it
includes the Africa Outreach programme
for the 2018 summit. This is in line with
the conclusions of the Sanya Summit.
This is intended to ensure continuity with
commitments made at the 2013 Summit in
South Africa, especially those of support for
African industrialisation and infrastructure
development. The summit will include a
number of invited African heads of state
based on the current or pending chairship of
their regional bloc.
This year’s Academic Forum included
several African embassy representatives as
observers. I am certain that as the BRICS
knowledge project grows and matures and
takes concrete shape, more stakeholders
and interested parties will be invited to
participate. Again this will be acting on the
intentions expressed in various resolutions
of our summits as communicated by BRICS
Leaders.

About the BRICS Think Tanks Council (BTTC)
The establishment of the BRICS Think Tanks Council (BTTC) was proposed at a meeting of the five BRICS countries’
think tanks in March 2013 and confirmed by the BRICS Leaders at the eThekwini Summit in Durban later that month.
The BTTC comprises the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA) (Brazil), the National Committee for
BRICS Research (NRC/BRICS) (Russia), the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) (India), the China Centre for
Contemporary World Studies (CCCWS) (China), and the National Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences
(NIHSS) (South Africa).
The main purposes of the establishment of the body, as encapsulated in the BTTC Declaration on the Establish-
ment of the BRICS Think Tanks Council, are to form a platform for the exchange of ideas among researchers, aca-
demia and think tanks; to convene the BRICS Academic Forum, and to present policy recommendations and guidance
to the BRICS Leaders for consideration.
About the South African BRICS Think Tank (SABTT)
BRICS is a platform for dialogue and cooperation for the promotion of peace, security and development in
a multipolar, interdependent and increasingly complex, globalising world – Delhi Declaration, 27 March 2012
The National Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences (NIHSS) was established on 5 December 2013 as
an independent statutory body in terms of Gazette No. 37118 vol. 582 and in accordance with Section 69 read with
sections 38A, 38B, and 38C of the Higher Education Act (Act 101 of 1997). The scope or application of the NIHSS
will be to advance and coordinate scholarship, research and ethical practice in the fields of Humanities and the Social
Sciences (HSS) within and through the existing public universities and those to be established or declared in future as
public universities.
The work of the NIHSS is guided by the following principles:
• cooperation between institutions and the establishment of communities of scholarship in South Africa, Africa and
internationally
• functional differentiation as opposed to resource differentiation.
The role of the NIHSS is to broadly enhance and support the HSS in South Africa and beyond, as well as to advise
government and civil society on HSS-related matters. It conduct its work through various programmes, including
the Doctoral Schools, Catalytic Projects, African Pathways Programme and through supporting the Department of
Higher Education and Training in the implementation of the proposed corrective interventions.
In 2015, the NIHSS was requested to be the permanent host of the South African BRICS Think Tank, including
the Academic Forum. In February 2015, the former Minister of Higher Education and Training, Dr Bonginkosi
Nzimande, gave the NIHSS the function to permanently host the South African BRICS Think Tank.
The South African BRICS Think Tank is chaired by Professor Ari Sitas.
SABTT objectives:
• Provide a platform for researchers and academics to exchange ideas and to generate evidence-based policy

Why BRICS is important to
South Africa
By Dr Iqbal Survé
Chairperson of the BRICS Business Council, SA Chapter
W
hen you identify
an opportunity,
grab it, steer it and
keep it on course
with everything
you have. I believe
in steering true north, and now we have an
opportunity to chart a new course for the great
SAS South Africa. As the Chairperson of the
Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa
(BRICS) Business Council, South Africa
Chapter; as an innovative entrepreneur and
businessman; and above all else, a South
African, I have many concerns.
Our high unemployment rate, educating
our youth, equipping them with relevant skills,
building infrastructure, our gross domestic
product (GDP) and attracting foreign direct
investment (FDI) are high on my agenda.
There is no argument that we are dealing
with one of the most important destructive
apartheid legacies, second-class education
– which led to a myriad of social evils. The
results of which need more than just two
decades to repair.
We have to credit our government for
realising the goal for South Africa to be a
partner in this multinational forum. The State
continues to amend policies and laws to create
attractive conditions to draw investments.
It was after intense lobbying with economic
giants and wealth-creating nations, Brazil,
Russia, India and China, that we joined the
partnership eight years ago. We set ourselves
on a course to roll back centuries of economic
drought.
BRICS gives us an opportunity to create
jobs, and work in tangent with the partnership
to re-skill and up-skill our workforce. It is not
up to the Government alone to fix this. The
State is not a creator of a lot of jobs. This is
where the private sector has a role to play; to
work hand in hand with the Government.
It is without question, for our economy to
grow, we need to create jobs for millions of
young people. South Africa has participated
in many multinational institutions, such as
the United Nations, the African Union and the
G20. Our partnership with BRICS is not meant
to be at the exclusion of other investment
partners such as the European Union and
North America. It is intended to augment the
partnership and draw increased investment.
Protectionism
However, protectionism politics from
traditional trading partners such as the United
States and some European countries, has had
immediate negative economic consequences
for South Africa and the 1,2 billion-strong
African family. To keep the ship afloat, we
have to remain innovative and in tune with
our alliance. We must see BRICS as a flotilla,
able to survive the headwinds and the storms
One of the opportunities BRICS gives
is to cut red tape and we have made some
headway in that. Even though our economy is
smaller than the rest of the BRICS nations, we
are equal partners when it comes to decision-
making and entering into agreements with
other partners.
BRICS and the BRICS Business Council,
South African Chapter, which I lead by
appointment of the Government, oversees
and guides infrastructure, deregulation,
agribusiness, financial services, skills,
manufacturing, energy and the green
economy working groups.
The Business Council plays a crucial role.
It is there to ensure that as a country we can
channel FDI from across the world, but mostly
from Brazil, Russia, India and China.
Through BRICS, we have access to the
global market, and access to capital. Our
government debt is 51,7% of the GDP; most
of the country’s budget goes to servicing
that debt and investing in infrastructure.
Therefore, because we are constrained, we
cannot invest in new opportunities to create
jobs. But, our partners in BRICS, which have
the capital, are able to invest to create jobs.
When we seek out FDI, we must ensure that
there are skilled jobs, in addition to jobs in
low-cost manufacturing. We are aiming for
investment that needs a higher skill level,
such as in car manufacturing. The more
skilled our workforce, the more attractive we
become for investments.
The BRICS Skills Development Working
Group set up the BRICS Skill Governance
Body to oversee skills development for the
labour force, which includes the learnings and
challenges faced in skills development.
The year-on-year employment growth
was driven by manufacturing (145 000),
construction (143 000) and finance (152 000).
There is no doubt we are on a road made of
BRICS, cemented by the hopes and dreams
of 3,6 billion people.
We have to credit our government for realising the goal for South Africa to be
a partner in this multinational forum. The State continues to amend policies and
laws to create attractive conditions to draw investments.

T
his year, we mark the
centenaries of two notable
Africans: Tata Nelson Mandela
and Mama Albertina Sisulu.
These are Africans who, at
different times in the history of
our continent, bequeathed to us values and
behaviours that stand us in good stead in the
21st century.
By President Cyril Ramaphosa
Both Tata Mandela and Ma Sisulu dedicated
their lives to securing better social and
economic conditions for all the people of our
country and our continent.
I was recently very honoured to interact
with a global industrial giant and a group of
highly skilled and productive young South
Africans in Amanzimtoti, KwaZulu-Natal.
My visit to the South Coast took me to the
Volvo Trucks factory, where Volvo had firmly
placed its confidence and its capital in South
Africa as a vibrant, productive and profitable
investment destination.
Sensitive to the need for us to promote
manual work in the midst of the unstoppable
march of automation, Volvo continues to
invest in providing skills to its energetic team
of assembly workers.
Between them, these impressive young
people turn the key on a new Volvo truck
every 45 minutes, thanks to the skills, sound
working conditions and motivation with which
they have been empowered.
These young workers have not only
become self-sufficient individually, but the
material support they provide to their families
means that purchasing power and personal
pride and dignity are living side-by-side in
neighbourhoods around Amanzimtoti.
This story illustrates that the achievement
of the African Union’s (AU) Vision 2063
relies on seemingly isolated and disparate
stories that are unfolding from Amanzimtoti to
Abidjan, Algiers and Addis Ababa.
Yet, instead of being isolated and disparate,
these examples of progress are in fact part
of a rich tapestry of social and economic
transformation that, collectively, produce a
composite image of a continent on the rise.
It is therefore with a sense of hope and
optimism that we find inspiration in the
transformation that is sweeping across our
continent in waves of varying intensity and
size.
These waves of development and
transformation are constantly reshaping
the shoreline of underdevelopment and
disadvantage that used to characterise life on
our continent. Hopelessness and despair are
being eroded by the expansion of education
Our own new dawn is part of a broader continental dawn of shared growth and
prosperity, in which South Africa retains its position as a gateway to Pan-African
opportunity for the peoples of this continent and our international partners.
South Africa’s own growth stands to benefit significantly from – and contribute
to – the rising tide of development in our region and continent.

and entrepreneurship on our continent, and
the advancing empowerment of women in
African societies and economies.
In March this year, the AU Summit in Kigali,
Rwanda, reached the historic milestone of an
Agreement on the African Continental Free
Trade Area (AfCTA).
This agreement seeks to dissolve barriers to
shared opportunity and prosperity by enabling
the movement of people, goods, services and
knowledge around our continent.
This agreement places the best that Africa
has to offer at the disposal of all Africans and
promises to reduce the inequality that exists
across national borders.
Poverty and underdevelopment often exist
just a few kilometres away from prosperity
and progress.
The agreement on an AfCTA took place
on a continent far removed from the Africa
in which Pixley ka Seme penned his 1906
essay, titled: The Regeneration of Africa.
Seme called for all the people in the land
to unite and see the continent as equal in its
contribution to civilisation.
His generation understood that the
responsibility rested on their shoulders to
restore the dignity of the African people.
They challenged the Eurocentric
stereotypes of Africa as a dark continent.
It was our forebears, especially those
who had early contacts with their Diaspora
counterparts studying overseas, who
exchanged ideas on how to confront colonial
oppression.
In the interconnected world of today where
we as Africans assert ourselves as equals
– not subjects – in the global governance
system and the globalised economy, we
are able to sustain the thinking and work
pioneered by Pixley ka Seme.
Our current task is to shape the progressive
and prosperous Africa we wish to bequeath to
future generations.
This future must be the outcome of a shared
vision in the same way that our dismantling of
the shackles of oppression and colonialism
relied on solidarity and unity in resistance.
Therefore, in 2018, we continue to be
guided and inspired by Kwame Nkrumah
of Ghana, Murtala Mohammed of Nigeria,
Patrice Lumumba of Congo, Amilcar Cabral
of Guinea Bissau, Agostino Neto of Angola,
Eduardo Mondlane of Mozambique, Seretse
Khama of Botswana, WEB Du Bois and Martin
Luther King Jr of the United States, Marcus
Garvey of Jamaica, and our own Albert Luthuli
and Nelson Mandela.
We remain inspired by the words of Madiba,
when he said: “I dream of the realisation of the
unity of Africa, whereby its leaders combine
in their efforts to solve the problems of this
continent.”
The realisation of Madiba’s dream rests
on leaders from all sectors of our society –
leaders in government, business, labour,
communities and civil society at large across
the continent.
In our own instance as South Africa, we are
taking steps to transform an economy that
remains largely characterised by the structural
flaws of a racist and patriarchal past.
Our own new dawn is part of a broader
continental dawn of shared growth and
prosperity, in which South Africa retains
its position as a gateway to Pan-African
opportunity for the peoples of this continent
and our international partners.
South Africa’s own growth stands to benefit
significantly from – and contribute to – the
rising tide of development in our region and
continent.
This rising tide entails political and
economic cooperation, with outcomes that
include greater regional integration and
the development of regional infrastructure,
services and knowledge bases that equitably
benefit all member states.
Investors and innovators must feel at home
in Africa.
We must be inspired by our ancestors,
whose boundless creativity and majestic
works endure today.
The magnificent pyramids of Egypt, the
sculptures of the ancient kingdoms of Ghana
and Mali and Benin, the temples of Ethiopia,
and the rock paintings of the Kgalagadi, all
speak volumes about Africa’s innovation and
contribution to human development.
Increasingly, these representations of
African civilisation are being supplemented
by advanced infrastructure, industrial parks,
scientific laboratories and corporate tower
blocks that mark our continent’s urban
landscapes.
The engineers and artists of ancient times
have worthy successors in a new generation
of young scientists, technicians, financiers,
coders and designers.
Our task is to create the conditions for this
new generation to grow and thrive and to build
a continent of hope and progress.
We must constantly remind them of the
words of Madiba, who said:
“Sometimes, it falls upon a generation to
be great. You can be that generation. Let your
greatness blossom.”
It is then that the brighter day of which
Pixley ka Seme spoke will rise upon Africa.
It is then that our chains will be dissolved,
our plains will be red with harvest and our
crowded cities will send forth the hum of
business.
It is then that we will achieve an African
renaissance.
God bless Africa. Nkosi sikelel’ iAfrica.

T
he recent African Union (AU)
Summit, held in Nouakchott,
Mauritania, took several
important decisions that will
place the continent on a path
to rapid growth and stability,
as envisioned in the AU’s long-term vision
document, Agenda 2063.
Landmark resolutions place
Africa on the path to rapid
growth, stability
By Lindiwe Sisulu
Minister of International Relations and Cooperation
Agenda 2063 is a strategic framework
for the socio-economic transformation
of the continent up to the year 2063, the
centenary year of the founding of the AU’s
predecessor, the Organisation of African
Unity.
The vision document sets out ways
through which African states can
collectively accelerate the implementation
of past and existing continental initiatives
for growth and sustainable development.
The Africa Rising  narrative has never
been more evident than now with the
AU’s collective commitment to the
implementation of the African Continental
Free Trade Area Agreement, which will
have a far-reaching impact on the African
economies and significantly increase intra-
Africa trade, investment and infrastructure
development.
The free trade area agreement will
integrate Africa, leading to the creation of
a single market of over one billion people
and approximately US$3,3 trillion in gross
domestic product (GDP), making it the
world’s largest free trade area.
To date, 49 of the 55 member states of
the AU have signed the agreement, while
six countries have ratified the agreement.
During the summit, South Africa, Namibia,
Burundi, Lesotho and Sierra Leone signed on
to the agreement, increasing the number of
signatories to 49 countries.
eSwatini and Chad deposited their
instruments of ratification, thereby increasing
the number of states who have ratified the
free trade area agreement to six. The other
counties that have ratified it are Kenya,
Ghana, Rwanda and Niger. The agreement
will enter into force once 22 states have
ratified it.
Following the signing of the agreement at
the Summit by President Cyril Ramaphosa,
the agreement will be submitted to Parliament
as part of the process towards its ratification.
The agreement is an important step
towards South Africa’s participation in this
market that will create opportunities and
many benefits for the country and enable
South African companies to export goods and
services across the continent.
It will contribute to the growth and
diversification of our economy and therefore
create jobs, as well as reduce inequality and
unemployment.

investment, is the establishment of the AU
Development Agency.
The AU Summit approved the establishment
of the agency as a technical body of the
AU, and requested the AU Commission, in
consultation with the New Partnership for
Africa’s Development (NEPAD) Planning and
Implementation Agency, to develop a statute
for the agency and submit it for adoption at
the January 2019 AU Summit.
The NEPAD Agency is responsible for the
implementation of the AU’s Agenda 2063 and
works to support the realisation of various
development programmes and initiatives
within African countries. The transition from
NEPAD to the development agency will be
undertaken as part of the establishment of the
latter.
These positive developments offer the
prospect of a new dawn for Africa.
The unity and renewal of our African
continent must be pursued together with
efforts to transform the global system.
It is within this context that the upcoming
10th Brazil, Russia, India, China and
South Africa (BRICS) Summit in Sandton,
Johannesburg, under our Chairship, will host
an Africa Outreach meeting of selected Heads
of State and Government.
This approach was started in Durban when
we hosted the BRICS Summit in 2013.
Our view is that we must continue to
promote and enhance the implementation of
the AU’s Agenda 2063 through the BRICS
mechanisms, among other routes.
In this way, we will be able to improve intra-
Africa trade and leverage more on alternative
sources of funding than the BRICS New
Development Bank provides for infrastructure
development and sustainable development.
The continent is already benefitting in
this regard, particularly in implementing the
BRICS-funded AU North-South Development
Corridor projects.
An effective, efficient and a financially self-
reliant AU is required if the continent is to
achieve its goal of integration, development,
peace and security.
In this regard, the AU Summit discussed
various institutional and financial reform
measures, which will not only place our
continent on the path towards Africa’s
transformation, but will also reverse the
dependency that hampers the development
of the full potential of our continent.
Africa continues to make progress in its
quest to mobilise financial resources within
the continent through the full implementation
of the decision on financing of the AU,
adopted in 2016.
With the efforts that have been put in
place in the fight against corruption and
illicit financial flows, Africa can augment and
enhance its prospects for adequate self-
financing for its development agenda.
The continent has become generally
politically stable and has over the past 20
years made significant strides in deepening
democracy and good governance. Conducting
elections has also become regular.
Peace and security matters were also high
on the agenda of the AU Summit, where the
situation in South Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea,
Libya and Somalia was discussed. Progress
made in the fight against terrorism and
extremism on the continent was also raised.
The AU Summit adopted two very important
resolutions on the AU’s Agenda 2063 Flagship
Project on “Silencing the Guns in Africa by
2020”.
Firstly, member states were urged to mark
September as Africa Amnesty Month by
mobilising citizens to voluntarily surrender
illegally owned weapons.
Secondly, member states were called on to
submit reports on their efforts to implement
the AU master roadmap on practical steps to
silence the guns in Africa by 2020.
The goal of “Silencing the Guns in Africa
by 2020”, as contained in Agenda 2063,
will coincide with the end of South Africa’s
two-year tenure on the United Nations
Security Council (UNSC). Our term as a non-
permanent member of the UNSC will run from
January 2019 to December 2020.
Among the priorities South Africa will
pursue in the council to achieve this goal
will include: addressing the inextricable
link between security and development;
strengthening political solutions to conflict
situations, including through preventive
diplomacy, conflict prevention and
management, mediation and peace-building;
and strengthening cooperation between
the UNSC and the AU Peace and Security
Council in the maintenance of international
peace and security.
South Africa is fully committed to
implementing the decisions taken at the AU
Summit level.
For too long, laudable initiatives have
failed to come to fruition as a result of failure
to implement. Our leaders are becoming
increasingly impatient with delays and
procrastinations.

BRICS in Africa: Working towards
the realisation of African aspirations
By Luwellyn Landers
Deputy Minister of International Relations and Cooperation
T
he 10th anniversary of
Brazil, Russia, India,
China and South Africa
(BRICS) and our hosting
of the BRICS Summit in
July takes place in a very
important year, the Year of Nelson Mandela,
who would have turned 100 in 2018. This
is an opportune time to again reflect on the
important pillars of our foreign policy that
Nelson Mandela identified in 1993 when he
penned an article, titled: “South Africa’s Future
Foreign Policy: New Pillars For A New World”.
He said: “Economic development depends on
growing regional and international economic
cooperation in an interdependent world”.
This is one of the pillars our foreign policy
objectives remain predicated on. Suffice to
say that it is in this context that South Africa
accepted the invitation to join BRICS in
2011. We believe that economic cooperation
remains an important instrument to pursue
our national interests and improve the living
conditions of our people.
South Africa’s foreign policy outlook is
predicated on our African history and identity.
We are Africans by birth and therefore our
country belongs to this continent and not as a
result of geographical composition.
In the same vein, Africans are part of the
Global South comprising in the main countries
which were colonised and citizens who were
subjugated for a long time. The BRICS
formation signifies a longstanding tradition of
solidarity that was firmly established 63 years
ago, in April 1955. This was when countries of
Asia and Africa met at the historic Bandung
Conference to determine their stance and
common goals in the emerging Cold War era
and assert themselves in the international
system. The historic result of the Bandung
Conference was the formation of the Non-
Aligned Movement (NAM) in later years.
Amid pressure from the Cold War
bipolarisation, those countries were able to
concertedly affirm that they would choose
neither the East nor the West, but pursue their
own path and strategy under the “Bandung
Principles” of the Afro-Asia solidarity. South
Africa was at the Bandung Conference,
represented by selected African National
Congress leaders.
Russia as a member of the BRICS identified
themselves with the anti-colonial struggle and
development of countries of the South. Their
involvement in our own country as well as our
struggle against apartheid is well documented
and they continue to support our development
priorities in the post-Cold War and post-
apartheid era.
Following the attainment of democracy,
South Africa has appreciated the common
socio-economic challenges of countries of
the South. These challenges continue to be
compounded by an international system that
perpetuates the marginalisation of developing
countries. In this context, South Africa sought
to forge partnerships with other developing
countries through formations such as BRICS
to address historic imbalances and economic
inequalities.
Even before South Africa joined BRIC,
reference was made by scholars and
commentators to its potential. The concept
“BRIC” was first mooted by Jim O’Neill of
Goldman Sachs in reference to emerging
economies. Perhaps what becomes important
and relevant today is that while this concept
was intended to reflect emerging markets
and investment opportunities, the acronym
became equated to a shift in global economic
power.
The original projections for the emerging
economies to become dominant global
powers were estimated at around 2050.
However, due to unforeseen positive growth
in their economies, particularly at the time of
the global financial crisis, such projections
have since been revised to 2027. The BRICS
countries produce a third of the world’s
industrial products and one half of agricultural
goods.
According to the Standard Bank Report on
BRICS, published in 2017, as at the end of
2016, the collective gross domestic product
of BRICS was larger than that of the entire
European Union, and accounted for 22,5%
of total global output. Though the value of
external trade relationships has declined,
BRICS is still a collectively profound trading
partner for developing economies in general
and Africa in particular, with these flows
South Africa’s foreign policy outlook is predicated on our African history and
identity. We are Africans by birth and therefore our country belongs to this
continent and not as a result of geographical composition.

bolstered by investment on the continent,
particularly from China, South Africa and
India.
In this regard, there is general consensus
that since its inception, the BRICS formation
has joined an array of interregional bodies
that contribute to the global diffusion of power.
It is not an illusion that BRICS countries
collectively and individually contribute to
the tectonic shift due to, among others, the
increased economic dominance of China and
the re-emergence of Russia.
These shifts and changes in the global
sphere augur well with our African Agenda.
The unity and renewal of our African continent
must be pursued together with efforts to
transform the global system. Humanity can
thrive when their collective and individual
interests and aspirations are responded to
and the BRICS formation is tilting the balance
of forces to ensure exactly that.
It is within this context that during the
upcoming Summit, we will host an Africa
Outreach meeting of selected Heads of State
and Government. This approach was started
in Durban when South Africa hosted BRICS
in 2013. Our view is that we must continue
to promote and enhance the implementation
of the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063
through BRICS mechanisms.
There is no contestation that
the establishment and subsequent
operationalisation of the BRICS New
Development Bank (NDB) provides an
alternative for project funding. This will again
complement the existing global traditional
financial institutions. The BRICS mandate is
to ensure that infrastructure and sustainable
development project funding by the BRICS
bank is made available to countries that are
not members of the formation.
We have started to implement some of
the selected and profiled BRICS projects.
These projects and areas included: Insurance
and Re-insurance Cooperation; the BRICS
Seed Bank; Infrastructure, including
Electricity Generation and Transmission; the
BRICS Cable Project; the AU North-South
Development Corridor; the Oceans Economy;
Cooperation in Aviation; and Manufacturing.
We witnessed with pride the first tranche
of NDB project loans disbursed in 2016.
This included a project in renewable energy
amounting to US$180 million to South Africa.
This has enabled us to stabilise our electricity
grid supply and keep much-needed jobs
through continued operations in factories.
In May 2018, South Africa was granted an
additional loan of US$200 million by the NDB
for expansion of the Durban Port. The NDB
has disbursed loans totalling US$5,1 billion.
As we continue leveraging the opportunities
provided by the BRICS formation, we must
ensure that we infuse and harness youth
dividends. Young people represent 66% of
South Africa’s population and the challenge,
at hand, is how to harness their collective
potential to be productive and contribute to
the growth of an inclusive, knowledge-driven
industrial economy.
In his maiden State of the Nation Address,
President Cyril Ramaphosa gave clear
direction on youth empowerment; a message
that will cascade to all the facets of the 10th
BRICS Summit. “Our most grave and most
pressing challenge is youth unemployment. It
is, therefore, a matter of great urgency that we
draw young people in far greater numbers into
productive economic activity. Young South
Africans will be moved to the centre of our
economic agenda.”
I am certain that this can be achieved within
the ambit of the intra-BRICS cooperation work
programme, as contained in the BRICS Action
Plan. Similarly, we want to see deepened
engagements with the South African BRICS
Business Council, BRICS civil society and
academic community.
In 2017, China innovated on the traditional
Outreach approach by introducing the concept
of BRICS Plus, which entailed a dialogue with
emerging markets and developing countries.
The rationale behind the BRICS Plus
concept is to create a platform for greater
interaction and partnerships among countries
of the Global South to shape the agenda to
effect changes in the global economy, notably
for:
• development and economic growth
through trade and investment integration
• cooperation in global governance
financial, economic and political
institutions.
In the interest of ensuring maximum synergy
between South Africa’s Chairship of BRICS
and that of China’s in 2017, South Africa
has also elected to consider a BRICS Plus
element. In this regard, South Africa has
elected to invite the leaders of the following
countries representing regional economic
communities in the Global South and the
United Nations (UN):
• Argentina: as Chair of the G20 and
influential Common Market of the South
member
• Indonesia: as Co-Chair of the New Africa-
Asia Strategic Partnership with South
Africa and influential Association of
Southeast Asian Nations member

We are confident that the 10th BRICS Summit
will prove a success as the previous one
hosted in eThekwini in 2013. The following
new areas of BRICS cooperation have been
proposed by South Africa:
• establishment of a Working Group on
Peacekeeping
• establishment of a Vaccine Research
Centre for Collaboration with BRICS
vaccine innovation and development
partners – this is intended to be a physical
research centre focussed on research
and development and vaccine innovation
• establishment of a BRICS Gender
and Women’s Forum – intended as a
dedicated track for gender and women’s
issues, given the economic benefit to
be derived from the socio-economic
empowerment of women, particularly in
developing countries
• leveraging the Strategy for BRICS
Economic Partnership towards the
pursuit of inclusive growth and advancing
the Fourth Industrial Revolution – this is
intended to foster discussions to address
opportunities provided by the Fourth
Industrial Revolution, as a means of
leapfrogging development stages and
bridging the digital divide
• establishment of a BRICS Tourism Track
of Cooperation.
South Africa’s approach to its Chairship
is grounded in the intention to ensure
programmatic continuity for BRICS and
commitment to execute approximately 100
sectoral meetings, reflective of the expanded
BRICS architecture. We also intend to
bring a specific focus to the challenges
and opportunities presented by the Fourth
Industrial Revolution.
We believe that, in this second decade of
existence, the BRICS formation has gained
sufficient experience to play a larger, active
and more constructive role in global affairs.
We must build on the achievements recorded
in the past decade and further strive towards
collective prosperity and contribute to the
greater cause of humanity.
We have stated in various platforms that
our membership of BRICS will never be
misconstrued as a negation of our relations with
countries of the North. This is a complementary
mechanism, which has already proven to be
beneficial to its members and certainly will
benefit the African continent

BRICS provides us with a
unique opportunity

provides us with a unique
opportunity as we usher our
country into a new dawn of
shared prosperity for all.
2018 has been declared the Year of
Nelson Mandela with a view to commemorate
his centenary and to celebrate his legacy.
Similarly, this year also marks the centenary
of Mama Albertina Sisulu and as such, South
Africans will be joined by the international
community for the commemorations of the
centenary of not one but two international
icons of the anti-apartheid struggle.
This year’s programmes have been
designed in such a way that it deliberately
remembers and follows on the footsteps of
these two gallant stalwarts of our liberation as
a lesson to the new generation of commitment,
resilience, selflessness and dedication in
service of the people.
The global economy is showing signs of
recovery and improved growth. Here at home,
we have entered into a new contract, a new
dawn, where our economy occupies centre
stage, and business confidence and investor
sentiment are improving.
We are working extra hard to capitalise on
this positive turn as indicated in the reversed
economic rating from negative to stable by
Moody’s.
As President Cyril Ramaphosa alluded
in his speech at the South Africa-Canada
Investor Engagement: “This is a positive
development, which can be attributed to
the implementation of more predictable and
transparent policies.
“The revised outlook conveys the
message that South Africa is politically and
economically stable and is becoming more
attractive to potential investors.”
We are aware of the challenges that face
us here at home and also on the international
stage, where South Africa continues to punch
above its weight, while the global trends
have indicated the rise of Alt-Right popular
politics and also an increase in inward-looking
policies that have shifted defined goalposts
on matters surrounding international trade
and migrations.
These challenges offer us a unique
opportunity as the Brazil, Russia, India, China
and South Africa (BRICS) grouping to assume
a key role in introducing initiatives that will
champion the course of internationalism that
is under siege under the theme: “BRICS in
Africa: Collaboration for Inclusive Growth
and Shared Prosperity in the 4th Industrial
Revolution”.
We are therefore continuing with efforts to
fast-track the socio-economic transformation
of our society in line with our shared vision
as encapsulated in the National Development
Plan (NDP) 2030. As spelt out in the NDP,
our transformation agenda can only be

realised through cooperative partnership with
business through public-private partnerships.
For our part, government is doing everything
possible to improve existing conditions to
increase foreign investment in the country.
South Africa remains an investment
destination with strong economic and financial
sectors.
Furthermore, our intensive efforts in
engaging in various strategic partnerships are
yielding positive returns. Such partnerships
will greatly contribute to the diversifying of
African economies while also contributing to
the continental efforts of building infrastructure
which will bode well for the intra-Africa trade
agenda we are working on.
The intention of the BRICS Leaders to
find expression beyond the highest political
domain is being realised through increased
people-to-people cooperation, which has
spurred new and increased platforms for
BRICS cooperation, including youth and
women, among others.
In the context of South Africa’s summit
deliverables for 2018, a proposal has been
made for the establishment of a BRICS
Women’s Forum as a fully-fledged cooperation
track, under which discussions around
the socio-economic empowerment and
advancement of women will be deliberated
and advanced.
The Fourth BRICS Youth Summit, organised
by the National Youth Development Agency
(NYDA), in cooperation with the Department
of National Planning and Evaluation, took
place from 16 to 21 July 2018 under the
theme “Radical Economic Transformation –
Making the BRICS Bank Work for Youth”. The
objectives of the Youth Summit were to:
• encourage young leaders among
BRICS nations to actively participate in
addressing the most significant global
challenges, economic and social issues
and development agenda
• establish constructive exchange of views
on strategic issues empowering youth
• build ideas for a brighter and better
tomorrow.
A Concept Note on the establishment of the
BRICS Women’s Forum was presented by
the Department of Women at the First BRICS
Sherpa/Sous-Sherpa Meeting from 4 to 6
February 2018 in Cape Town.
It is envisaged that the Women’s Forum will
be established prior to the 10th BRICS Summit
from 25 to 27 July 2017 in Johannesburg.
The proposed forum is aimed at providing a
platform for BRICS members to:
• engage on critical issues of gender
equality and women’s empowerment
• address major concerns related to women
across the BRICS countries
• promote mainstreaming of women’s
issues across BRICS’ processes, priority
areas, declarations and agreements
• provide a platform for exchange of best
practice, research and knowledge relating
to BRICS women and girls.
Proposed priority areas for collaboration of
the BRICS Women’s Forum include poverty
eradication. financial inclusion of women,
entrepreneurship and business innovation,
and bridging the digital divide.
The President has urged all stakeholders to
work together on a social compact to create
jobs, particularly for young South Africans.
In this regard, we have, in collaboration
with the private sector, launched the Youth
Employment Service initiative in March this
year.
Over the next three years, this initiative
aims to create paid work experience
opportunities in South African companies to at
least one million young people. Young people
represent 66% of South Africa’s population
and the challenge at hand is how to harness
their collective potential to be productive and
contribute to the growth of an inclusive and
knowledge-driven industrial economy.
We are confident as well that we will realise
our full growth potential and targets of our
social pact, which President Ramaphosa
announced to drive investment that aims to
raise US$100 billion over the next five years.
The interaction with the private sector under
the auspices of the BRICS Business Council
will assist us to realise this undertaking.
This is important considering that all
BRICS member states are committed to
support youth employment in their respective
countries. One of the ways to overcome
the challenge of youth unemployment, is
for BRICS to prioritise the development of
small and medium enterprises. In doing so,
we must place emphasis on creating young
entrepreneurs as compared to job seekers.
For our part, the African Union focussed
its thematic work in the previous year on
harnessing the demographic dividends
and therefore work has begun to deal with
youth unemployment on the continent. We
believe that the young generation will help
us to realise our development aspirations as
contained in Agenda 2063 as well as ensuring
that we are not left behind in this era of the
Fourth Industrial Revolution.
We remain steadfast in utilising the BRICS
mechanisms to achieve both our national and
continental development agenda. The BRICS
New Development Bank (NDB) has opened
its Africa Regional Centre and we believe that
this centre will facilitate development funding
for countries on the continent. The NDB has
already accomplished the unthinkable in the
few years of its existence. By June 2018, the
bank has approved loans of US$5,1billion
(R68,7 billion) and it envisages to reach
US$15 billion worth of loans by 2021. The
recent meeting of the Board of Directors and
Governors of the NDB has approved a budget
for six new projects.
Accordingly, the bank has approved a loan of
U$200 million to Transnet in order to enhance
the capacity of the Port in Durban. The
project will see the rehabilitating of the port’s
container terminal docks that are currently
operating beyond their original design, and
the upgrading of port infrastructure to provide
additional slots for larger vessels.
Our aim is to unlock the economic potential
of our country, which includes realising the
full benefits of our ocean economy to fight
poverty and underdevelopment. This requires
commitment to initiate and manage systemic
changes in our economy.
Other benefits from our membership
with BRICS countries is the increase in
foreign direct investment and access to
markets which were witness when South
Africa starting exporting beef to China. Our
business community and in particular, small
to medium enterprises, utilise these leverage
of our bilateral and multilateral agreements to
achieve business success and create much-
needed jobs for our economy.
In this context, I recall Tata Madiba’s words
during the rally address following his release
from Pollsmoor Prison, on Sunday, 11 February
1990, in Cape Town when he called for:
“A fundamental restructuring of our political
and economic systems to ensure that the
inequalities of apartheid are addressed and
our society thoroughly democratised.”
We are under no illusion that a lot still
needs to be done to improve the ease of
doing business in our country and also ways
of incorporating small business into the
economy. Our special economic zones should
be encouraged to open up opportunities
to small, medium and micro-enterprises to
stimulate economic growth and enhance
participation of the previously disadvantaged.
We must work hard to eliminate the
constraint of doing business to grow the
economy and also attract new investment.
South Africa is indeed open for business.
BRICS provides us with a unique opportunity
One of the ways to
overcome the challenge
of youth unemployment,
is for BRICS to prioritise
the development of small
and medium enterprises.

BRICS is more important
than ever in a changing
world
By Nomvula Mokonyane
Minister of Communications
T
he recent sign of tension in the
G7 grouping has led to more
focus being placed on other
multilateral organisations
around the world, including
Brazil, Russia, India, China
and South Africa (BRICS).
This is an important moment in world
history, with the United States of America
(USA) adopting a go-it-alone policy and
determined to pursue a unilateralist form of
international economic diplomacy. The time
has come for the BRICS grouping to increase
its interaction with partners, particularly in
Africa, which already contains some of the
fastest-growing economies in the world.
And that is why the theme this year is
“BRICS in Africa: Collaboration for Inclusive
Growth and Shared Prosperity in the
4th Industrial Revolution”.
While BRICS is well known as an inclusive
body where disparate languages and cultures
are able to gather together in peace and
cooperation, there is much to do to expand
the relevance of the grouping internationally
South Africa, by hosting the 10th BRICS
Summit in 2018, is crucially positioned to
feature as the main glue in this process.
The BRICS bloc has much to trumpet, as it
comprises around a quarter of the world’s
land mass and more than 40% of the
population according to figures released by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in
2017.
BRICS countries contributed over 23% to
the world economy in 2017 and this is likely
to rise to nearly 27% by 2022 according
to the IMF. So, as delegates arrive for the
commemoration of the first decade of the
grouping, they will be well aware of their
importance to the global order.
The G7 is far more powerful economically,
however, with the USA beginning to withdraw,
particularly in the last meeting in Canada in
June 2018 during which President Donald
Trump announced that he did no longer
honour pre-arranged agreements, this august
body may be down to what is known as G6
plus one.
This is a clear opportunity for the BRICS
grouping as the voice of the developing world
and none more so than in the area of shared
trade and finance.
An important focus of the BRICS grouping
is the New Development Bank (NDB), along
with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(CCI). The latter was set up ostensibly to
promote entrepreneurship and encourage
the youth to establish and grow businesses
across national boundaries.
In the modern world of online buying and
selling, accessing products from across
the world and then distributing them in your
country of interest, BRICS 2018 is what
could be called a perfect moment. The CCI is
tasked with building a repository of data and
information that can be used by members.
It also is building a database of business
partners across the world, as well as different
business sectors. However, a major stumbling
block, which it has been asked to address,
is the culture of doing business, which is
different across the BRICS countries.
For example, in South Africa, the banking
industry is owned by private enterprise,
whereas in China and Russia, there is a much
closer link between the State and banks.
This poses challenges for businessmen and
women from Brazil, South Africa and India, for
example, who want to work more closely with
Chinese business but may face headwinds as
trade issues escalate.
The same is true of Russia, where US and
European Union sanctions over the Crimea
means South African businesses could fall
foul of international law, should they pursue
growth in their BRICS partner country. Yet, we
remain committed to our BRICS partners as
they come under pressure, and considering
South Africa’s fundamentally important role in
Africa, there are other opportunities that have
emerged in recent years.
So far, the CCI has arranged a number
of working visits where mainly government
officials have exchanged views on global
business. The chamber’s focus is on the
digital economy, food processing and
agribusiness, manufacturing, rural and
affordable healthcare and logistics while at all
times seeking to improve skills development
and entrepreneurship.
While the CCI goes about its business, the
country is chairing other bodies, including the
Southern African Development Community
and the Indian Ocean Rim Association.
Furthermore, South Africa was successful
in its bid for a non-permanent seat on the
United Nations Security Council (UNSC) in
June 2018, and will take up its seat between
2019 and 2020.
South Africans are fully aware of the role
of BRICS and early in June 2018, during the
visit by the BRICS ministers of foreign affairs/
The second leg of the theme this year is the importance of
what is being called the Fourth Industrial Revolution. One
of the least understood realities is that there is a direct link
between what has become known as “science fiction” and
economic history.

international relations, the subject trended on
social media in the republic.
One of the most important aspects of the
grouping is the outreach programme, which
seeks to improve inclusivity and extend
cooperation to developing economies. With
the theme rooted in Africa this year, South
Africa is hard at work using a two-pronged
approach to this outreach concept by
promoting the BRICS Africa Dialogue and the
BRICS Plus cooperation.
Russia, in particular, along with South Africa
has been instrumental in being vocal about the
outreach concept. The BRICS Plus initiative
was outlined during China’s Chairship and a
meeting attended by the presidents of Egypt,
Tajikistan, Mexico and Guinea and Thailand’s
Prime Minister as invited guests took place
during the BRICS Summit in Xiamen.
There is a drive to invite other regional
associations from Africa to the summit in
Johannesburg in order to reaffirm the principle
of inclusive cooperation. There are areas of
mutual interest such as all-round innovation
and sustainable development, which is the
watchword on the continent with its incredible
diversity.
However, it’s the spirit of unilateralism and
the knowledge gleaned through decades of
being involved in such negotiations that put
South Africa in a strong position when it comes
to the BRICS process. The rules-based order,
which is at the core of international interests,
has seen the country voted onto the UNSC for
the period 2019 to 2020. This means South
Africa has once again emerged as a facilitator
and globally important partner.
The ministers commended African countries
and the African Union on the signing of the
African Continental Free Trade Area as an
important step to economic integration on the
continent, unlocking the tremendous potential
of intra-African trade and addressing the
socio-economic challenges. In this regard, the
ministers reiterated their support for Agenda
2063 and efforts to promote continental
integration and development.
Free trade is vital in order to secure growth
in the world’s economies and any attempt
to shut down or overprotect trade through
tariffs is a short-term solution to a long-term
challenge. It is also likely to damage direct
investment by business.
This is where the BRICS forum can make a
difference in the year South Africa is hosting
the 10th Summit. Ministers have already
pledged their support for efforts towards
improving governance through increased
representation of marginalised nations as
well as greater participation of developing
economies in decision-making. An exciting
development is the progress reported by the
NDB, which alongside the Africa Regional
Centre, will help consolidate this modern
investment thinking inside BRICS.
The second leg of the theme this year is
the importance of what is being called the
Fourth Industrial Revolution. One of the least
understood realities is that there is a direct
link between what has become known as
“science fiction” and economic history.
South Africans are well endowed with a
long list of brilliant thinkers who have made a
name for themselves internationally, using the
innovation that comes from African thinking
combined with a global market. Elon Musk,
who was born and raised in Pretoria, is an
example. While now living and working in
the USA, there is no doubt the developer of,
among others, the Tesla electric, was shaped
by his formative years avidly consuming
science fiction and other science-related
material while being surrounded by a vibrant
and changing society.
Another is Mark Shuttleworth, who was an
early adopter to the technology of the Internet
and who created a way and who understood
BRICS is more important than ever in a changing world

52
UBUNTU - BRICS SPECIAL www.brics2018.org.za
that the revolution of the digital world
fundamentally changed the way we live and
work.  He designed and built the first online
payment system called Thawte, which is
now the standard in an industry that is worth
hundreds of billions of dollars.
We are only into the second decade of
this revolution and there is no real blue print
and future map. Governments around the
world are trying to respond to this tech heavy
future by rapidly developing their core skills
and improving education methodology to take
advantage of this new world.
While the digital revolution began mid-way
through the 20th century, the blurring of the
lines is now accelerating and causing some
confusion for policymakers. For example,
how should the Internet be run in terms of
freedom of information, cost of reaching that
information and dispensing the content, and
coping with the threats in the digital world?
Countries can now reach out and strike
each other through a few keystrokes on a
computer keyboard. According to the World
Economic Forum (WEF), there are three
reasons why this revolution of technology is
different from the previous.
The first is the scope of the change. Now,
we have entire factories being run by robots
which are interlinked using data-reading
computers. The speed at which we now
have to work or that business must operate
is a second reason why this revolution is
different. Think about the trading systems
on stock exchanges such as the Dow where
algorithmic trade, as it is now called, accounts
for most of the daily activity instead of humans
pressing buttons.
The third is the impact on systems.
Disruptions are taking place at a pace which
is hard to fathom. Applications and platforms
are replacing legacy businesses such as in
human transport, with Lyft and Uber, among
others, now dominating the so-called gig-
economy. The flow of cash and capital
between companies and out of countries has
become a threat in terms of tax and other
financial systems. How does a country in the
BRICS bloc such as Brazil or South Africa
ensure that the registered company in these
locales are paying the taxes associated with
their sector?
The Fourth Industrial Revolution has
its challenges, particularly with warnings
that it could lead to greater inequality as
it disrupts traditional labour. Automation
means fewer people are being hired and as
youth employment directly relates to societal
stability, how are countries going to create
new jobs for their citizens lost to technology?
This is going to be one of the points under
discussion during the BRICS Summit in South
Africa.
However, there will be an increase in safer
jobs with machines going underground to
protect workers. In South Africa, the mining
industry is a major job creator, but mines that
are up to three kilometers deep are by their
very nature, incredibly dangerous places to
send men and women.
With talent emerging as a central feature of
the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the displaced
workers will quite possibly be working in
more rewarding and safer jobs, according
to the WEF and other think tanks. However,
the low skill/low pay versus high-skill/high
pay segments of our various populations
could lead to increased social tension, but it
is something that the BRICS countries are
highly aware of, and are proactively dealing
with.
Our Chinese partners, for example,
are building a capacity in terms of global
innovation when it comes to solar energy.
Beijing has focussed on this technology for
strategic and economic rea sons, and South
Africa has already seen 27 large-scaled
power projects signed off this year alone,
which will use sustainable energy to produce
electricity.
More than 30% percent of the globe now
uses social media platforms of various
types to learn about the world around them.
However, this technology is being exploited
by governments and private enterprises and
even propagandists to spread racist and other
extremist content. This is a challenge that
must be well met and managed by BRICS
states and we cannot avoid the implications
for each country in the bloc.
The growing demand for transparency is
to be welcomed as South Africa has led the
drive to improve the quality of information that
can be used by its citizens in order to improve
services. However, citizens are also free to
voice their opinions and even share content
linked to services, so it is actually helping to
improve government’s delivery by listening
more effectively to its people.
As the physical, digital and biological worlds
continue to converge, new technologies
and platforms will increasingly enable
citizens to engage with governments, voice
their opinions, coordinate their efforts and
even circumvent the supervision of public
authorities.
Governments which are able to successfully
embrace this new disruptive world caused by
the Fourth Industrial Revolution and improve
efficiency in operations will endure.
A traditional top-down approach to
responding to this new opportunity is no longer
satisfactory as the rapid pace of change
means those countries with a highly stratified
process of information management may
find their own citizens will circumvent their
policies and build their own. Agile governance
has become the watchword for governments
around the world, and our BRICS partners
are well placed in this to adapt to the ever-
changing environment and become more
collaborative.
The Fourth Industrial
Revolution has its
challenges, particularly
with warnings that
it could lead to
greater inequality as
it disrupts traditional
labour. Automation
means fewer people
are being hired and
as youth employment
directly relates to
societal stability, how
are countries going
to create new jobs
for their citizens lost
to technology? This
is going to be one
of the points under
discussion during
the BRICS Summit in
South Africa.

he year 2018 marks the
10th anniversary of the
Brazil, Russia, India,
China and South Africa
(BRICS) partnership.
Since its inception, BRICS
cooperation has expanded to a wide range
of issues – trade, industry, international
cooperation and security, science, health,
energy, water, environmental affairs, and
agriculture, among others.
With a combined gross domestic product
of US$15 trillion (R205 trlllion), BRICS
countries account for 19,3% of gross global
product; 25,7% of the world land area;
more than 40% of the world population;
and have contributed more than 50% to
the world’s economic growth during the
last 10 years. Intra-BRICS trade grew from

US$567 billion in  2010 to US$744 billion in 2017.
Similarly, South Africa-BRIC trade grew from
US$28 billion to US$35 billion over the same
period. Both South Africa exports to and
imports from other BRICS countries have
grown at a rate faster than South Africa’s
global trade, thus increasing the importance
of other BRICS countries in South Africa’s
trade basket.
Combined, the BRICS countries account
for 15,4% of South Africa’s global exports and
25,4% of the country’s imports. The BRICS
Trade and Industry Ministers’ meetings are
taking place at a time when the multilateral
trading system is facing unprecedented
challenges.
This includes the rise in unilateral
measures that are incompatible with the
World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules that
put the multilateral trading system at risk. Of
key concern is the disregard of the multilateral
rules and principles that underpin international
trade.
We are also witnessing a shift that seeks
to question the continued relevance of
development-focussed multilateralism. In
addition, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is
transforming the global economy.
New technologies and approaches are
merging the physical, digital and biological
worlds in ways that will fundamentally
transform humankind. The extent to which
that transformation is positive will depend on
how we navigate the risks and leverage the
opportunities that arise along the way.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution is based

Importance of the BRICS trade and investment agenda
Global trade rules should facilitate effective participation of all countries in the
multilateral trading system in order for developing and least-developed countries
to secure a share in the growth of world trade commensurate with the needs of
their economic development. In this regard, we continue to work with our BRICS
partners to advocate for an inclusive multilateral trading system that promotes
inclusive growth, integration of developing countries in the global economy and
sustainable development.

of digitisation, automation and networking.
Cyber-physical systems are an essential
feature of the technical infrastructure. This
is expected to lead to disruptive changes
in production and services, which require
appropriate regulatory frameworks,
infrastructure and skills to support and enable
the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
In the context of these global developments,
South Africa’s membership of BRICS has
been one of the key strategic partnerships
of the democratic South Africa and is a key
platform for promoting South-South trade
and investment. South Africa’s drive to
attract US$100-billion investment over the
next five years requires leveraging trade
and investment partnerships to achieve this
objective.
South Africa is relatively well represented
as a destination country for intra-BRICS
investment. In 2016, it attracted 6,2% of
intra-BRICS investment, at R34,5 billion.
This mainly originated from India and China.
South African companies utilised investment
opportunities in other BRICS countries, mainly
Brazil and China, to the value of R22,6 billion.
BRICS countries are important developers
of technology, sometimes embodied in
investment. Investment promotion aims to
contribute to the creation and development
of hi-tech industries and move South Africa
towards a knowledge economy. Our objective
is to also promote investment into South
Africa’s special economic zones.
South Africa’s Chairship of BRICS presents
an opportunity for collaboration among
BRICS countries on the Fourth Industrial
Revolution with a view to share and exchange
views on regulations and policies to shape
markets, including learning best practice from
other BRICS members to ensure businesses
in the respective countries can effectively
participate in the Digital Industrial Revolution.
While BRICS countries are competitors
in the trade and investment sphere, there
is agreement to advance cooperation
on the basis of complementarity. South
Africa’s participation in BRICS, therefore,
provides opportunities to build its domestic
manufacturing base, enhance value-added
exports, promote technology sharing, support
small business development and expand trade
and investment opportunities. This is more
likely to be achieved through participation in
the value chains of these countries.
In relation to the multilateral trading system,
the BRICS Trade and Industry meetings
present an opportunity for the development
of a coordinated message on the centrality of
a rules-based multilateral trading system, as
embodied in the WTO.
Global trade rules should facilitate effective
participation of all countries in the multilateral
trading system in order for developing and
least-developed countries to secure a share in
the growth of world trade commensurate with
the needs of their economic development.
In this regard, we continue to work with our
BRICS partners to advocate for an inclusive
multilateral trading system that promotes
inclusive growth, integration of developing
countries in the global economy and
sustainable development.
What makes BRICS more significant
is the expansion of its institutional
framework, including the establishment of
the New Development Bank (NDB) and the
development of a Strategy for BRICS
The NDB aims to finance, among others,
infrastructure projects in developing countries.
This presents an opportunity for collaboration
in the development of key infrastructure
projects that contribute to regional integration
in the African continent and facilitates the
creation of regional value chains to boost
industrial development.
Importance of the BRICS trade and investment agenda
BRICS countries are
important developers of
technology, sometimes
embodied in investment.
Investment promotion
aims to contribute
to the creation and
development of hi-tech
industries and move
South Africa towards a
knowledge economy.
Our objective is to also
promote investment into
South Africa’s special
economic zones.

BRICS STI partnership a recognised force in global science arena
UBUNTU - BRICS SPECIAL www.brics2018.org.za
In South Africa, we live by the credo that science knows
no borders. It is only by sharing our resources, experience
and expertise that the global community will effectively put
research and innovation at the service of our societies,
achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. We should
therefore concertedly invest in and further develop our BRICS
STI partnership, which has become a recognised force in
the global science arena.

T
he Department of Science
and Technology (DST)
is strongly committed to
the Brazil, Russia, India,
China and South Africa
(BRICS) partnership in
science, technology and innovation (STI).
Over the years the five BRICS partners have
developed an impressive portfolio of jointly
funded BRICS research and innovation
initiatives, which have also played a critical
part in fostering friendship, solidarity and
political and economic relations between
the BRICS partners. We have put Science
Diplomacy into practice.
When we meet as BRICS ministers
recently, our mission was to strengthen our
partnership to ensure STI plays an optimal
role in further enhancing the competitiveness
of the BRICS economies and in improving the
quality of living of all our citizens. Our Heads
of State entrusted this critical task to us when
at the 2017 BRICS Summit they explicitly
recognised innovation as a key driver for
growth and sustainable development. The
2018 BRICS Summit, to be hosted by
President Cyril Ramaphosa in July, under the
theme of “BRICS in Africa: Collaboration for
Inclusive Growth and Development in the 4th
Industrial Revolution”, will provide a further
opportunity to consider the critical role of STI
as part of the overall BRICS partnership.
As policymakers for our governments,
the BRICS Ministerial Meeting provided a
valuable opportunity for us to share within our
partnership, our respective experiences and
expertise, in formulating and implementing
policies and strategies, which will ensure
innovation-driven growth. This is especially
useful for South Africa, as the Ministry of
Science and Technology is preparing a
new White Paper on STI . The White Paper
is intended to guide our efforts to ensure
we are successful in promoting inclusive
development in South Africa through science
and innovation.
The new policy document will have an
important focus on the role government
should play in enabling innovation, notably by
instilling a national innovation culture across
all spheres of government. This is certainly
an area where we can learn much from
our BRICS partners. In addition, receiving
attention will be ensuring that appropriate
supply-side measures such as funding and
other incentives fulfil their role as drivers for
innovation performance. Equally important
will be the role of demand-side measures
to promote the so-called innovation pull,
through for example the leveraging of public
procurement and specific support for small
and medium enterprise development. This
is an area where Brazil has significant
experience.
Another priority will be the promotion of
grassroots innovation, ensuring all South
Africans enjoy the opportunity to create and
exploit innovation opportunities. Grassroots
innovation is notably a strategic focus area in
our bilateral cooperation with India.
Of course, we will not achieve our vision
without successful policies and practices
to facilitate the contribution of industry and
business to innovation-driven growth.  Without
the participation of our enterprises, the so-
called innovation chasm, which hampers our
economies, will continue to persist. Unless
our enterprises assist us to bridge this divide
between research and the marketplace,
we will be faced with the continued inability
to translate a significant proportion of our
research and development results into socio-
economically useful products and services.
Through STI, the business sector also
has a critical role to play in diversifying our
economy, helping us to develop a competitive
knowledge economy, not dependent on raw
materials and other commodities.
For South Africa, cooperation with and
learning from our BRICS partners is crucial
also in this domain. We therefore greatly
value the strategic partnership with China on
Science Park Cooperation, launched during
Vice Premier Liu Yandong’s visit to South
Africa last year. We, for example, admire the
success of the Skolkovo Innovation Centre
in the Russian Federation, a prime example
of concerted investment in a public-private
partnership to boost innovation and the
development of hi-technology enterprises.
We should also spare no effort to promote
youth innovation and entrepreneurship.
In this regard, the DST hosted in the City
of Durban, as a precursor to the BRICS
Ministerial Meeting, the annual BRICS Young
Scientists Forum, bringing together more
than a 100 young scientists from the BRICS
partners. The youth is our future.  Eliminating
poverty, unemployed and inequality starts by
investing in our youth. The immense potential
of their ingenuity, drive and commitments are
our most precious assets for the future, and
these should be permitted to blossom in the
BRICS partnership.
In South Africa, we live by the credo that
science knows no borders. It is only by sharing
our resources, experience and expertise
that the global community will effectively
put research and innovation at the service
of our societies, achieving the Sustainable
Development Goals. We should therefore
concertedly invest in and further develop our
BRICS STI partnership, which has become a
recognised force in the global science arena.
Successful cooperation between South
Africa, China and India, is for example one of
the pillars underpinning the global partnership
to advance the Square Kilometre Array global
radio telescope project, of which we launched
the MeerKAT precursor telescope on 13 July
2018. We hope the Russian Federation and
Brazil will join soon.
Furthermore, in another example of the
impact of our collaboration, South Africa
and Brazil have launched a science plan for
South-South research cooperation in the
South Atlantic Ocean. I hope that we will
also be able to support the building of STI
capacities elsewhere in Africa through our
BRICS partnership. In this regard, I would
like to acknowledge the efforts of China under
the Forum for China-Africa Cooperation and
also of all the BRICS partners who continue
to invest in and support Africa.
This year marks the centenary anniversary
of democratic South Africa’s first President,
our beloved and iconic leader, Nelson
Mandela. His legacy should also inspire our
BRICS partnership, including in science and
technology, to take action and inspire change.
In the words of one of the other historic
leaders of South Africa’s liberation struggle
Chief Albert Luthuli, who in 1961 stated:
“Scientific inventions at all conceivable
levels should enrich human life, not threaten
existence. Science should be the greatest
ally, not the worst enemy of mankind.”
BRICS STI partnership a recognised force in global science arena
The youth is our
future.  Eliminating
poverty, unemployed
and inequality starts
by investing in our
youth. The immense
potential of their
ingenuity, drive and
commitments are
our most precious
assets for the future,
and these should be

Small business is big
business
By Lindiwe Zulu
Minister of Small Business Development
S
outh Africa’s Brazil, Russia,
India, China and South
Africa (BRICS) membership
contributes to further
leveraging economic
opportunities for its own
development agenda, as well as that of the
continent. South Africa’s interaction with
fellow BRICS states is premised on three
levels of engagement:
• national: to advance its national interests
• regional: where it promotes regional
integration and interaction with specific
emphasis on the African Union (AU)
mandate given to South Africa to promote
infrastructure development throughout
the continent
• global: where it advocates for a more
inclusive global governance system.
As part of the developing world, South
Africa faces the triple challenges of poverty,
unemployment and inequality. BRICS
Leaders engage in peer learning and share
best practices and development models
to address and combat these common
challenges.
South Africa uses its membership of BRICS
to garner BRICS support for AU priority
programmes, including Africa’s infrastructure
development; industrialisation; and spatial
and regional integration initiatives; and more
recently, for the overarching socio-economic
development plan, Agenda 2063.
BRICS seeks to advance the restructuring
of the global political, economic and financial
architecture into one that is more equitable
and balanced and which rests on the
important pillar of multilateralism. International
financial institutions that are more just and
representative will better serve and support
the interests of all members, especially the
development of emerging economies.
Our government has identified small
businesses and cooperatives as critical
to creating an economy that benefits all.
It is by investing in small businesses and
entrepreneurship that we will be able to
defeat the triple challenges of poverty,
unemployment and inequality. Small
businesses and cooperatives hold the key to
unlock our country’s economic potential.
There is consensus across government that
the economy needs a thriving small business
and cooperative sector to reach national
socio-economic goals of a prosperous and
inclusive society. It is only through a flourishing
inclusive economy that the challenges of
inequality, unemployment and poverty can be
comprehensively addressed.
Across the globe, experience demonstrates
that small business and cooperatives thrive
if an enabling environment is created and
if there is a robust partnership between
government, big business small, medium and
micro-enterprises (SMMEs) and cooperative
sector.
It is in this context that the Department
of Small Business Development (DSBD)
was established. As a department, we are
committed to fulfilling the objectives of the
National Development Plan (NDP), which
enjoys overwhelming support from the people
of South Africa as a realistic proposition
to grow and develop an inclusive national
economy.
Since 2014, we have been mobilising
society across the board and raising
awareness around the issues and challenges
confronting small businesses. We are
successfully placing small businesses and
cooperatives firmly on the national agenda.
In order to unlock the potential of (SMMEs)
and cooperatives, we have proposed five
critical areas that could play a major role in
the promotion and development of the small
business sector. The five areas are:
• public sector procurement
• building market access into private-sector
value chains
• simplifying the policy and regulatory
environment
• access to finance
• support to township and rural economies.

The country’s high rate of unemployment and
extreme inequality call for bold and far-sighted
interventions. The NDP is the vehicle which
will address poverty, unemployment and
inequality. It sets an ambitious aim to treble
the size of the economy by 2030; a daunting
challenge that will require our collective
contribution. Meeting the NDP’s growth target
of 5,4% for the next 16 years will not only
guarantee South Africa’s material prosperity,
but will be an elevating and inspiring narrative
for the country – “an optimistic new story”, as
the NDP phrases it.
As the NDP makes clear, getting South Africa
onto a high-growth trajectory demands that
we fundamentally change our game plan and
place small businesses and cooperatives
Across the globe, experience demonstrates that small business and cooperatives
thrive if an enabling environment is created and if there is a robust partnership
between government, big business and the SMMEs and cooperative sector.

at the centre of our war against poverty,
inequality and unemployment. Developing
a strong and growing SMME community is
a cornerstone of the NDP’s vision. SMMEs
are expected to be central to South Africa’s
job creation efforts, in line with international
trends.
One of the specific targets of the NDP is
to reduce unemployment to 6% by 2030
through the creation of 11 million jobs. The
NDP projects that if we implement the full
range of its recommendations, our economy
will grow at 5% per annum, with 60% to 80%
of this value being generated by SMMEs
and expanding businesses, and that this
sector will create 90%, or 9,9 million, of the
11 million new jobs we will boast by 2030.
Hence our bold assertion: small business is
big business!!
This task is not only limited to government
but is a joint compact between government,
civil society and the private sector. The key
responsibility of government is to create an
enabling environment for small business to
take their rightful place in the mainstream
economy.
We see small businesses and cooperatives
as critical to creating an economy that
benefits all.
Our point of departure is that small
businesses can be the backbone of any
economy and the main driver of economic
growth, poverty reduction and job creation.
A healthy SMME sector can make a massive
contribution to the economy by creating more
employment opportunities and generating
higher production volumes.
As South Africans, we remain concerned
that small businesses have an exceedingly
high failure rate, and the majority of the
casualties are black and women-owned
businesses. Statistics tell us that small
businesses have only 37% chance of
surviving four years and only a 9% chance of
surviving 10 years. Between 70% and 80%
of small businesses fail in their first year, and
only about half of those who survive remain
in business for the next five years. Among
a variety of reasons why small businesses
collapse, is lack of access to markets. For
this reason, we must prioritise supplier
development as one of our key and critical
intervention strategies.
We have adopted new Broad-Based
Black Economic Empowerment codes,
which incorporate supplier development
programmes that include and integrate
SMMEs. There is, however, a need for us
to ensure that we have a solid monitoring
and evaluation system that ensures that big
business includes SMMEs in their supplier
development programmes.
It is through the department’s overall
portfolio that includes the Small Enterprise
Development Agency (SEDA), which provides
non-financial support to enterprises, and the
Small Enterprise Finance Agency (SEFA),
which offers financial support to SMMEs
and cooperatives, that we believe we can
implement these interventions to enable
SMMEs and cooperatives to develop and
thrive.
Access to finance is one of the key
constraints faced by entrepreneurs, be
it a start-up or an existing SMME and
cooperative wishing to diversify or explore a
new opportunity. Time and time again, these
starts-ups, young people, people living with
disabilities and women in particular, tell us of
their frustrations with banks and development
finance institutions (DFIs), which refuse to
support them because they are perceived
as high-risk ventures, irrespective of the
brilliance of their proposals or demonstrable
potential to succeed.
A core tenant of government’s small
business policy is the provision of finance to
start-up enterprises and those that struggle
to get funding from commercial finance
institutions. Since its establishment six years
ago, SEFA has financed 286 000 SMMEs and
cooperatives to the value of R5,5 billion and
facilitated the creation and maintenance of
312 235 formal and informal sector jobs.

60
UBUNTU - BRICS SPECIAL www.brics2018.org.za
disbursed R1,2 billion to 45 035 SMMEs and
cooperatives and facilitated 54 144 jobs.
Integral to its mandate, SEFA has during the
last 12 months provided targeted finance
support to:
• 44 792 black-owned enterprises to the
value of R836 million
• 9229 youth-owned enterprises to the
value of R191 million
• 44 116 women-owned enterprises to the
value of R403 million.
The Black Business Supplier Development
Programme (BBSDP) is another financial
instrument, which a cost-sharing grant mainly
extended to expanding SMMEs. Since
2014/15, 2 558 SMMEs were supported to the
value of R1,32 billion.
President Cyril Ramaphosa reiterated
in the State of the Nation Address that
“government will honour its undertaking to set
aside at least 30% of public procurement to
SMMEs, cooperatives and township and rural
enterprises.”
Hence, the department together with
National Treasury, is determined to sharpen
the monitoring and implementation of the
30% Set Aside Policy for SMMES. The Public-
Sector Supply Chain Review confirmed that
in 2016/17 alone, government spent over
R750 billion on the procurement of goods
and services, as well as construction works.
However, many SMME continue to complain
that they are overlooked.
We hold the view that 30% is not the ceiling.
Instead it is the minimum value of contracts
which should be awarded to the SMMEs and
cooperatives. It is encouraging that there are
many departments and a few provinces which
have far exceeded the 30%.
The payment of suppliers within 30 days
remains a challenge. As at September 2017,
a total of 71 883 invoices to the value of
R4,3 billion were older than 30 days and not
paid. In the 2017/18 financial year, the DSBD
was among those departments which paid
100% of its invoices within 30 days. However,
there are many departments who are non-
compliant.
We are determined to implement stronger
enforcement measures because we cannot
turn a blind eye to departments who are in
flagrant violation of a policy decision and
Treasury Regulations and who cause the
collapse of SMMEs and cooperatives. Our
programmes are responding directly to the
plight of small businesses and cooperatives.
The BBSDP continues to support the
development of black entrepreneurs through
the provision of equipment, machinery and
tools, which they require to expand their
business operations. This cost-sharing grant
funding has been in operation for quite a
number of years now, and has benefited
black-owned businesses all over South Africa.
The Cooperatives Incentive Scheme (CIS)
is a support programme in the form of a grant
set aside for cooperatives.
It provides a 100% grant for the acquisition
of tools, machinery and equipment for
both start-up and expanding cooperatives,
thereby providing them an opportunity to start
production and generate profits.
Financial support entails access to
business loans that are provided through
SEFA at favourable rates (below market
rates). The role of the DSBD is to:
• assist youth access financial support from
SEFA
• ensure quality and accessibility of support
from SEFA and act as an intermediary
where there are challenges
• identify additional programmes for
financial support within the context of the
incentives offered by the department.
It is important to note that the incentives
administered by the department, except for the
CIS grant, focus on growth and expansion of
SMMEs and are only accessible to enterprises
that have been established and operational
for at least a year and stipulate other criteria
which the CIS beneficiaries will have to fulfil.
The department’s Youth Directorate will also
assist with handholding and counsel, by
directing young entrepreneurs to DFIs.
SEFA offers a range of financing products
to qualifying SMMEs and cooperatives to start
and grow their businesses. These products
include:
• Working capital loans, targeted at
enterprises which do not have sufficient
working capital to fulfil a specific contract.
Such loans are for a maximum duration
of 12 months.
• Term loans to finance longer-term working
capital requirements.
• Specific capital acquisition.
• Business expansion projects with a re-
payment term of between one and five
years.
• Revolving credit facilities for established
SEFA clients with satisfactory credit
records and is to facilitate short-term
capital requirements for the delivery of
existing customer contracts or orders.
The capital repayments plus interest are
structured in relation to the cash flow
projections of the borrower.

There are a range of non-financial support
measures, ranging from identifying a
business idea, conducting market analysis,
business finance, bookkeeping etc. which
are primarily offered by the DSBD through
SEDA. SEDA has a national footprint, with
offices in all provinces as well as at district
level and in some instances, municipalities.
The department will facilitate access to this
support for beneficiaries who have an interest
in establishing a business or cooperative.
Together, we move SMMEs and
cooperatives forward.
The provisional 2017/18 financial year loan
performance indicators show that SEFA disbursed
R1,2 billion to 45 035 SMMEs and cooperatives
and facilitated 54 144 jobs.
The Cooperatives Incentive Scheme (CIS) is a
support programme in the form of a grant set aside
for cooperatives. It provides a 100% grant for the
acquisition of tools, machinery and equipment for
both start-up and expanding cooperatives, thereby
providing them an opportunity to start production
and generate profits.

By the Department of Mineral Resources
W
hen South Africa
joined Brazil,
Russia, India and
China (BRIC)
in 2010, it was
an affirmation
of what the country had achieved and
represented a strong foundation for building
Africa's growth and regeneration. BRICS
member countries have natural resources
and investment potential that are changing
the face of the mining world. South Africa is
one of the most promising emerging markets
globally, mainly because of the abundance of
natural resources and huge exploration real
estate; political and economic stability with
sound mining regulatory and macro-economic
management; a world-class financial system;
favourable cost of doing business supported
by excellent infrastructure; readily available
geological information; and skills availability.
South Africa’s mining industry is one of
the country’s key economic sectors with
the potential for a substantial contribution
to economic growth, job creation and
transformation, consistent with government’s
objectives of higher and more balanced
economic and inclusive growth as stipulated
in the National Development Plan.
The mining sector in South Africa has been
a cornerstone of South Africa’s economy
with over 150 years of formal mining
experience and it continues to be a mineral
investment destination of choice. The country
continues working to ensure the growth and
sustainability of the sector through innovation.

Government intends on strengthening the
linkages between mining and manufacturing,
thus ensuring maximum benefit is leveraged
from the development of the country’s mineral
resources and that the country is placed on a
more sustainable growth path by supporting
industrialisation.
South Africa’s partnerships in mining with
other BRICS member countries:
Brazil
South Africa and Brazil held a joint commission
in 2013 and an action plan was produced.
The action plan provides for various
measures to be taken in a variety of fields,
including mineral resources, more balanced
trade, encouragement of investment in South
Africa’s manufacturing industry (mineral
beneficiation) and skills development.
South Africa has noted with interest the
decision by Brazil to abolish a vast national
reserve to open the area for commercial
mineral exploration to stimulate and grow
the contribution of mining to the Brazilian
economy.
Russia
South Africa continues to support the Inter-
Governmental Committee on Trade and
Economic Cooperation, which was established
in 1999 as a coordinating bilateral body to
exploit trade and investment opportunities
and identify and resolve potential obstacles
in areas of cooperation between South Africa
and Russia.
The Department of Mineral Resources,
supported by relevant state-owned entities,
engages its Russian counterparts on the
following areas of cooperation:
• Sub-committee on Mineral Resources,
which was established to implement the
Agreement between South Africa and
Russia on Cooperation in the Field of
Exploration, Mining, Processing and
Beneficiation of Minerals, signed in 1999.
The implementation plan was finalised in
October 2017 and is awaiting sign-off by
the two ministers.
• Joint Working Group on Platinum
Group Metals (PGMs), which is the
implementation mechanism of the 2013
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
on Cooperation in PGMs. The strength of
the South Africa-Russia partnership lies in
their dominance in PGM resources. This
partnership is envisaged to lead to better
collaboration in the discovery of new
technologies to diversify the application
of PGMs, the sharing of best practices
for geological survey and exploration of
PGMs and combating illicit trafficking,
among others.
India
India has a vibrant diamond beneficiation
industry, which South Africa can learn from
as one of the largest diamond-producing
countries. India also has an advanced
diamond cutting and polishing industry. One of
the identified value chains in the Beneficiation
Strategy of South Africa is the establishment
of the Integrated Jewellery Hubs under the
Jewellery Fabrication Value Chain. South
Africa is considering collaborating with India
in the following areas:
• training in cutting and polishing of
diamonds
• fostering cooperation between South
African designers and large-scale
producers from India
• joint programmes aimed at improving
jewellery manufacturing facilities in South
Africa
• encouraging Indian jewellery
manufacturing companies to set up
commercial jewellery manufacturing and
trading hubs in South Africa
• technology exchange and transfer.
China
The collaboration between South Africa and
China in the fields of mining and mineral
development takes place within the framework
of the MoU on Cooperation in the Field of
Geology and Mineral Resources, concluded
in 2011.
The two countries agreed to the establishment
of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership
based on equality, mutual benefit and
common development.
Under this partnership, the Bi-National
Commission was established to guide and
coordinate exchange and cooperation on
political and economic matters of mutual
interest in the bilateral and multilateral
spheres.
Mining Sectorial Committee meetings have
been taking place, with the last one held in
November 2016 between the Department
of Mineral Resources and the National
Development and Reform Commission of
China.
Some of the areas of collaboration that
have been identified include:
• Deepened collaboration within the context
of the Kimberley Process.
• The creation of favourable environments
to stimulate reciprocal investments
in South Africa and China to facilitate
mineral value chain integration.
• Encouraging both governments to support
each other’s companies' investment
in their respective countries, as far as
possible.
• Cooperation and investment in
beneficiation of product/projects, albeit
not limited to, polished diamonds,
precious metals jewellery, ferro-alloys,
and autocatalytic convertors. China has
urged South Africa to provide a list of
activities or projects aimed at expanding
collaboration and stimulating local
production.
• Commitment to exploring collaborative
opportunities between our respective
technical entities, which include mineral
processing technologies as well as
diamond trading, cutting and polishing
techniques.
South Africa will continue with efforts to support
investment in mining and beneficiation with a
particular focus on the growth and promotion
of small and medium-sized enterprises.
The country’s mining sector has the
potential to unlock economic investment
opportunities that will develop and sustain the
country even beyond the lifespan of mining
operations.
The Department of Mineral Resources will
support business and create an environment
conducive for investment in the mining space.
The department will further work with its
counterparts in forging stronger partnerships
for the benefit of all South Africans, and the
African continent in general.

BRICS countries must
become climate change
patrons
By Sezeni Zokwana
Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries
I
t was with great honour that South
Africa hosted the Eighth Meeting of
the BRICS Ministers of Agriculture and
Agrarian Development in June 2018 in
Mpumalanga. It is not just about hosting
but about the important resolutions that
we ratified arising out of the work done by our
technical teams. Important forward-looking
decisions were taken last year in Nanjing,
China, and these were built on during the
Eighth Meeting of Ministers.
As Brazil, Russia, India, China and South
Africa (BRICS) agriculture ministers, we are
racing against time in making meaningful
impact against hunger, food security and
climate change phenomena. While our pace
is commendable in this regard, we must not
rest on our laurels and be complacent about
the mammoth tasks lying ahead.
As BRICS, we are an emerging bloc that
carries with it the aspirations of more than
40% of the world population. Within this
population lies challenges of poverty, food
insecurity and the effects brought about by
climate change as it affects production levels.
The United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO) made an interesting
observation that: “With the clock ticking
toward the 2030 deadline for meeting the
international goals to eradicate hunger and
poverty, ministries of agriculture in five of the
world’s most important emerging economies
are well positioned to take a leading role in
helping to achieve these objectives …”
In his address to the Seventh BRICS
Meeting of Ministers in China last year,
Assistant Director-General and the FAO’s
Regional Representative for Asia and the
Pacific, Kundhavi Kadiresan, made the
following interesting remarks: “Despite the
trends towards urbanisation, poverty in the
world today is primarily rural. As a result,
accelerating rural development will be key
to achieving the Sustainable Development
Goals. The question is how to do it? Our
experiences in countries in different parts of
the world have shown that it can best be done
through a combination of agricultural growth
and targeted social protection, but also
through growth in the rural non-farm economy
…  Agriculture can be a driver of sustained
and inclusive rural growth. In low-income
countries, growth originating from agriculture
is twice as effective in reducing poverty as
growth originating from other sectors of the
economy”.
Economic indicators show that agriculture
in many parts of the world, no less in our
own country, carries a potential of being a
arger contributor (than it is) to national gross
domestic product, thereby representing a
sunshine economic sector that we must
nurture for prosperity of our nations. In South
Africa, despite the effects of drought to the
sector, the agricultural sector displayed
resilience and extricated this country from
technical recession in the third quarter of 2017
when other sectors faced sluggish growth.
We must embrace the technological take-
over that is replacing old agricultural
methods of doing agricultural business.
These are necessary disruptions that put us
on a hi-tech competitive edge with younger
generations becoming the masters of the
new technological revolution in the sector.
Through our collegiality as BRICS countries,
I plead that let us hand-hold each other; let’s
share information and experiences in our
scientific and technological advances that
each one of us has. As the BRICS bloc, we
must be driven by the great sense of solidarity
rather than competition, brotherhood rather
than enmity and increased intra-trade.
   Like many other countries which are affected
by extreme weather events and vulnerable to
the effects of climate change, South Africa
has been affected by meteorological hazards
such as drought, which has negatively
affected our economy.
South African agriculture, forestry and
fisheries are highly vulnerable and exposed
to the impacts of climate change due, on the
one hand, to our socio-economic context (e.g.
the many  land-dependent rural poor) and, on
the other hand, to an already high risk natural
environment (including high season to season
climate variability, extreme weather events
and times of severe water stress).
The impact of climate change is felt on both
food security and livelihood perspectives,
particularly by poor smallholder and emerging
farmers, as they are especially vulnerable

as they have little means or no resources to
cope with the increasing climate variability
and frequencies of extreme weather events.
Extreme weather events and their impacts
are increasing at an alarming rate. The
frequency and intensity of extreme weather
events are expected to increase as a result
of increasing climate variability and climate
change and this will negatively affect
agricultural productivity and food security.
Recent model projections for South Africa
generally indicate an increase in temperature
and rainfall variability. Adaptation to climate
change remains a top priority for the
developing countries such as South Africa.
Smallholder farmers represent about 80%
of sub-Saharan Africa’s farming population,
and suffer disproportionately in the face of
droughts, floods and other weather-related
events.
Extreme weather events are becoming
more frequent and more severe, threatening
the reliability and productivity of agriculture.
This state of affairs contributes negatively
to the already extreme levels of poverty and
is reinforcing inequity and chronic under-
nutrition.
These problems can only be solved
through the widespread adoption of more
resilient, productive, sustainable, equitable
and increasingly efficient farming practices.
It is important to increase capacity in the risk
reduction of disasters, the prioritisation of
training and awareness. These interventions
will ensure that knowledge about potential
hazards and usage of climate information
become widespread.
We also have to promote and adopt climate
smart agroforestry/fisheries approaches to
mitigate and adapt to the climate change
impact as well as to increase adaptive
capacity of producers, especially small
growers in the forestry and producers in the
fisheries sectors.
However, this climate change threat calls
on all of us as BRICS countries to become
climate change patrons by playing a more
meaningful role in the fight against global
warming. Global warming in large measure,
is man-made through selfish chasing of
profits by excessive industry heavy machine
polluters that produce greenhouse gas
emissions that influence our ozone, and in
turn affect our climate and agricultural land for
food production.
We are excited that significant progress
has been made to implement the BRICS
Action Plan: 2017 – 2020 for Agricultural
Cooperation of BRICS Countries, and this
includes the achievement of broader aims
such as:
• supporting the United Nations (UN)
efforts in fighting poverty and eradicating
hunger at the global level; exchanging
information, experiences and policies;
ensuring food security; enhancing
the food supply capacities of BRICS
countries; and reducing food crises
• implementing national programmes
of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development; exchanging and sharing
basic agricultural information and
technologies adaptive to climate change;
strengthening resilience of agricultural
productive systems and their adaptability
to natural and climate disasters; and
deepening cooperative research
• improving the livelihoods of farmers,
especially through capacity-building and
the participation of smallholder farmers
in the global agricultural value chains;
helping BRICS smallholders to increase
food productivity and improve food
security through meetings, technical
cooperation, technology demonstration
and training; as well as holding BRICS
seminars to share experiences of
agricultural resilience and adaptation to
climate change.
We would like to express our sincere
gratitude to all the participants (both local
and BRICS member states) who shared
valuable information and experiences and
also provided their valued contributions at the
BRICS Climate Smart Approaches Seminar
from 19 to  20 June 2018. The outcomes of the
successful BRICS Seminar encouraged all of
us to deepen cooperation under the theme:
“Promoting Cooperation and Exchange on
Climate Change for Stronger Agricultural
Resilience to Natural Risks”.
We proposed that BRICS member states
continued to engage on matters that would
enable us to achieve our common objectives
and ensure priorities are met. We should
focus more on increasing agricultural
research cooperation among the academic
and research institutions within BRICS
and tapping into international funding
mechanisms.

Education – an important
area of collaboration for BRICS
By Naledi Pandor
Minister of Higher Education and Training
T
he Brazil, Russia, India,
China and South Africa
(BRICS) partnership has
come a long way. In the
beginning, there were many
sceptics and naysayers
who gave it little chance of success.
Yet, here we are today, with a series of
meaningful structures, collaborations and
exchanges across a wide spectrum of areas
in place.
What started off as a trade and economic
partnership, has evolved into an array of
collaborative projects in education, science
and technology, arts and culture, agriculture,
health, sports and many others.
Education is an important area of collaboration
for BRICS, given the many developmental
challenges that our countries still face.
In November 2013, the BRICS ministers
responsible for education met on the
margins of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organisation General
Conference in Paris to agree on a roadmap
for education collaboration across BRICS.
Higher education mobility was a key
aspect of the discussions, leading to the
establishment of the BRICS Education
Working Group a year later in Brasilia.
There, the BRICS Heads of State
reaffirmed the importance of higher education
exchange for BRICS and called for a network
of universities across the BRICS countries
to collaborate and exchange knowledge and
research experience.
In November 2015, a Memorandum
of Understanding on the establishment
of the BRICS Network University
was signed in Moscow, Russia.
 This shows that the Network University
initiative is deeply entrenched within
BRICS, and in fact, a lot is expected from
it, not only by the BRICS Leaders and
countries, but by the entire developing world.
If universities in BRICS collaborate
successfully on research and teaching and
engage in student and staff exchanges,
we can make a significant contribution
to global knowledge production.
 The BRICS Network University is grounded in
the challenges, opportunities and aspirations
of the BRICS communities.
Through its research partnerships, the
BRICS Network University can help reduce
poverty, unemployment and inequality that
characterise many countries in the developing
world.
Through its teaching partnerships,
the BRICS Network University can
promote academic programmes that
produce the kind of graduates that
can lead our societies into the future.
 The thematic areas – energy, information
security, climate change, water resources and
pollution treatment – for the BRICS Network
University have been carefully crafted to
exploit our knowledge strengths.
We have a clear thematic focus, but this list
is not exhaustive. There are many others that
we will have to consider as we strengthen our
collaboration. Issues such as food security,
health, the changing nature of work and
others will come to mind.
Our BRICS university collaboration has
enormous potential to bolster the existing
strong political and economic relations
between our countries.
 By working together, we can achieve
our goal of becoming a powerful force
for growth, development and discovery.
 As part of the global effort to combat diseases
such as HIV and AIDS, our countries have
made significant progress in the production of
generic antiretroviral drugs.
As part of the global effort to explore
the universe, our countries have
made significant progress in satellite
construction and astronomy research.
As part of the global effort to contain
the impact of climate change, our
countries have taken significant steps.
 The BRICS Network University is an
important structure that will undertake the
research that is needed to inform the overall
BRICS collaboration and how it must evolve.
We need to manage participation
in the network carefully.
  We must ensure that we do so in a way that
does not advantage only a few universities.
   We must seek to ensure that a broad
spectrum of our universities benefit from and
contribute to the shaping of this important
structure.
There are pockets of excellence in all our
universities and our goal should be to benefit all.
  The development of joint research projects
and joint postgraduate programmes at
Master's and PhD levels is important.
The BRICS Network University can
be a driving force for building a closely
knit BRICS intellectual community.
It can foster new dynamics in South-South
cooperation while advancing intellectual
bonds and exchanges among the BRICS
academic community.
It can be a transmitter of cultural knowledge
and exchange between the BRICS countries.
I hope that our universities will take
full advantage of this initiative and seek
opportunities to collaborate in terms of
research, and in doing so, learn as much as
possible from one another.
I hope that universities will take ownership
of the initiative and come up with collaborative
projects that will be of benefit not only to
BRICS, but the developing world as a whole.
Education – an important area of collaboration for BRICS
What started off as a trade and economic
partnership, has evolved into an array of
collaborative projects in education, science and
technology, arts and culture, agriculture, health,
sports and many others.

Discovering the soul of
Africa
By Derek Hanekom
Minister of Tourism
We have unique attractions to share and stories to
tell, stories of our common origins and of early African
civilisations. Stories of courage and resilience abound,
including the story of Nelson Mandela, who would have
turned 100 years old this year.
T
he powerful stories of Africa –
a continent that has given so
much to the world – will never
cease to amaze the visitors to
our continent.
A record 62 million people
visited Africa in 2017, representing nothing
less than 8% year on year growth.
And to varying degrees, all countries on the
continent have the potential for exponential
growth, given that arrivals to our vast continent
represent only 5% of global tourists.
Travel and tourism is the fastest-growing
sector in the world, outperforming other
sectors of the global economy.
In Africa, examples abound of diverse,
world-class and accredited attractions
supported by transport, services and
communications infrastructure that compete
with the best on offer elsewhere in the world.
This is why we were able to offer
62 million visitors the opportunity to discover
the soul of the real Africa – not the false picture
sometimes portrayed on news bulletins.
Our attractions
 In Africa, we know how to welcome visitors
with warmth and with our own unique flair, and
we know how to host them professionally in
our own way.
We can guarantee a life-changing
experience. Story-telling is part of who we
are.
We have unique attractions to share and
stories to tell, stories of our common origins
and of early African civilisations.
Stories of courage and resilience abound,
including the story of Nelson Mandela, who
would have turned 100 years old this year.
We have experiences to offer of sacred
sites, of natural wonders, beautiful
landscapes, spectacular mountains,
wide open deserts and exquisite coastlines; of
heritage and culture; of music and dance and
astonishing artistic creativity. Visitors to Africa
experience one of the most profound stories
the world has witnessed: how the birthplace of
civilization is catapulting itself into the future.
Stories of ancient African civilisations
such as Great Zimbabwe and Mapungubwe
predate the story of Gorée Island in Senegal
which is, perhaps, one of our continent’s most
important symbolic sites.
Together with much-visited sites like
Mozambique’s Ibo Island and the Slave
Market in Stonetown, Zanzibar, these places
portray the triumph of the human spirit, and,
in the same way as Auschwitz, serve to renew
our commitment to never allow the atrocities
of history to be repeated.
Gorée Island and the rock hewn churches
of Lalibela in Ethiopia were the first two sites
inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1978.
Our continent now has more than 130 world
heritage sites.
As these sites become better known around
the world, they find their way onto the bucket
lists of tourists as iconic attractions, and they
become included in itineraries that connect
countries, attractions and people.
However, our strongest selling point that
sets us apart from the rest of the world is
probably our abundant wildlife.
In Tanzania, the Ngorongoro Crater Nature
Reserve has the largest concentration of wild
animals in the world.
In the Serengeti, tourists can witness the
most spectacular migration of animals on the
planet.
In the Mount Kenya National Park, home
to Africa’s second-tallest mountain, you can
touch the sky and experience the migratory
route of African elephants.
The Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in
Uganda is one of the last remaining homes of
the mountain gorilla.
These are animals you will see nowhere
else in the world. And we are of course also
proud of our own Kruger National Park, and
the many other national parks we have in our
country. Our visitors invariably become our
brand ambassadors as they return home with
a deeper understanding of Africa’s stories,
and they spread the magic of Africa.
Planning for the future
Tourism already contributes about 8% to
Africa’s gross domestic product and employs
6,5% of the workforce. Imagine the impact it
will make on growth, jobs and livelihoods if, or
rather when, we double and quadruple that.
We can exponentially increase the value
that tourism brings by collaborating to make
tourism work for everyone.
We must continuously enhance and expand
our attractions, we need constant training to
professionalise our services, and we need to
market our attractions in the most effective
way. We need to work together to ensure
ease of travel. All this in turn creates the right
climate and opportunities for investment,
which will lead to greater growth.
The Tourism Investment Seminar this
year will help us to assess the appetite for
emerging opportunities. We have created
opportunities for investors to interact with
a wide array of product owners, tourism
operators, development finance institutions
and representatives of government.
The African Ministers’ Session, which we
have hosted at the Africa Travel Indaba for
the past four years, has established itself as a
platform for policymakers to discuss emerging
tourism trends, opportunities and challenges
facing the tourism sector on our continent,
and most critically, the interventions required
to enhance the performance of the sector.
This year, we focussed on how integrating
regional tourism could be used as a tool for

economic development. We explored the
role of governments in creating a conducive
environment for regional tourism integration
and the role of the private sector and investors
in developing regional tourism products and
promoting growth.
Our countries are intertwined and our
complementary, rather than competitive,
interaction will lead to a fairer share of the
economic benefits of tourism for Africa.
There are many ties that bind the people
of this continent. During the years of our
liberation struggle, so many of us lived in
exile, and we were welcomed by our fellow
brothers and sisters in Africa.
The story of our struggle is a story that
unites us, a story that in the coming years
will no doubt see the unveiling of new sites
of historical interest to share with the rest of
the world.
The modern traveller is looking for a travel
experience that is distinctive and authentic.
Travel in Africa offers exactly that: an
unforgettable experience that leaves you with
unique stories to tell.
In Africa, our enduring tourism sites and
ancient cultural artefacts provide many
compelling reasons to visit.
It’s a package which is unmatched
anywhere in the world, and as we work
together to market ourselves to the world, we
start to write the true story of Africa.
Tourism growth and sharing the benefits of
tourism contribute to replacing poverty and
despair with prosperity and hope.
South Africa welcomed over 10 million
international visitors in 2017 and the
forecast for 2018 is very positive. We are
determined to stimulate inclusive growth in
the mainstream tourism economy and create
meaningful opportunities for the majority of
our population.
Indeed, the entire value stream of tourism
lends itself to the inclusion of women and
young people and those living in rural
areas. At this year’s Africa Travel Indaba, held
in May in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, 135 smaller
enterprises from all nine provinces attended.
This was 50% more than in 2017. We call
them our “Hidden Gems”. These small, up-
and-coming businesses add to the diversity
of our tourism offering and they are the rising
stars of tomorrow.
We are committed to supporting this critical
sector of our economy.
Let us take inspiration from what President
Cyril Ramaphosa said in his State of the
Nation Address.
He acknowledged tourism as a significant
driver of our economy and our country’s
development, and his rallying call Tuma Mina
– or “send me” – has echoed throughout our
nation.
It has been taken up in earnest by people
from all walks of life, and we are more
motivated than ever to continue building and
growing our tourism sector inclusively, and to
be the best ambassadors for tourism.
“Send us” on our homeward journeys
to develop and enhance what each of our
countries has to offer the world’s tourists.
“Send us” to do more business and grow
tourism and to create even more jobs.
“Send us” to convert the immense potential
of tourism into tangible and durable benefits
for all our economies, so that we improve
the lives of all our people. This year, we are
celebrating the centenary of our beloved
President Nelson Mandela. The South
African Tourism Campaign in celebration of
the Nelson Mandela centenary identifies 100
experiences, attractions and destinations
around South Africa that have strong historical
and social ties to Madiba’s life.
Tourists can experience the emotion and
relevance of each location through audio, text
and image galleries.
The two iconic well-known sites associated
with our first democratically elected President
are Robben Island and Vilikazi Street in
Soweto. The life story of this extraordinary
man is laid out for all to experience at many
other sites in our country.
As we take our brand of tourism to the
world, let us tell our own stories in our own
authentic way.
Let’s work together to replace the
sometimes negative narrative of Africa with
the real story of so many nations on the move,
of people innovating and moving confidently
into the future.
Let’s ensure that tourism makes a positive
and meaningful contribution to the lives of all
the people of Africa.
In Africa, our enduring tourism
sites and ancient cultural artefacts
provide many compelling reasons
to visit. It’s a package, which
is unmatched anywhere in the
world, and as we work together
to market ourselves to the world,
we start to write the true story of

Cultural collaboration
strengthened
A
s we strengthen relations
between the Brazil,
Russia, India, China and
South Africa (BRICS)
partners, let us be guided
by history that tells us
that long before colonisers arrived on our
shores, there was thriving Indian Ocean trade
between southern Africa and the Far East.
Archaeological evidence indicates that
shards of pottery and stoneware from the
Ming Dynasty, which began in the 1300s,
were found at the ruins of Great Zimbabwe
as well as a coin from the Sultan of Kilwa at
about the same period. Trade existed on the
Limpopo River during this period in an area
rich in gold. Pottery and beads from India
and Iran have been found at Iron Age sites in
South Africa.
The earlier kingdom of Mapungubwe, dated
to about 1045 AD, located at the confluence
of the Shashe and Limpopo rivers, left behind
remains that demonstrated its importance
in the trade between southern Africa, East
African ports, India and China. The wealth
of this society and its involvement in gold
smelting, was evident in the finding of golden
artefacts, notably the golden rhinoceros,
which has become a symbol of an African
civilization that flourished in pre-colonial
times.
 The late poet Laureate, Keorapetse “Bra-
Willie” Kgositsile, wrote that: “If destroying
all the maps known / would erase all the
boundaries / from the face of this earth / I
would say let us / make a bonfire / to reclaim
and sing / the human person”. His words
inspire us to move beyond the boundaries of
colonialism and into a future characterised by
the free flow of ideas between progressive
countries of the South and the championing
of the BRICS agenda.
BRICS Film Festival
It is in recognition of this great legacy of
pre-colonial trade, through our embrace as
a country of multilateralism, the reclaiming
of humanity through the striving for a more
inclusive and anti-racist world and the
collective efforts of BRICS countries, that
the Third BRICS Film Festival will have the
emblem of the Golden Rhino for its awards
and the celebration of the centenary of the
birth of former President and statesman,
Nelson Mandela, as its central theme.
The BRICS Film Festival takes place from
22 to 27 July 2018 in Durban as an initiative
of the Department of Arts and Culture
together with the National Film and Video
Foundation, with the opening and closing
ceremonies hosted at the Playhouse. The
film festival includes the best films from the
BRICS partners, a competition and award
segment for directors, actors and producers,
and a discussion on establishing a BRICS
Film Fund and a BRICS Film Treaty. These
are new initiatives, which will further develop
and strengthen the BRICS film industry and
sector.
The BRICS Film Forum will provide a space
to further interrogate these ideas, as well as
the funding of films, an audiovisual and co-
production treaty, distribution strategies and
animation matters.
BRICS Cultural Programme in 2018
The film festival is part of a broader cultural
programme. The Department of Arts and
Culture will present a cultural programme
during the South African Chairship of BRICS,
lasting from July to October 2018. This will
include showcasing the best artistic talents
during a cultural festival in September,
building on BRICS institution-to-institution
collaboration in youth theatre, museums,
galleries and libraries, culminating in the
BRICS Cultural Ministers Meeting in October
2018.
South Africa will develop and build on
previous BRICS cultural initiatives, initiated in
Brazil, Russia, India and China, and introduce
new areas of collaboration.
South Africa will host a cultural showcase,
presenting Madiba, the African Opera,  thus
paying tribute to former President Mandela
and carrying his spirit into the year of BRICS
in South Africa.
In September, South Africa will host BRICS
artists for a week-long cultural festival,
including established and new artists in
music and dance, bringing together the best
of BRICS arts and culture to South African
audiences in different provinces. Outreach
programmes and master classes will form
part of the festival, exposing young South
Africans, and introducing our veterans to our
BRICS partners.
A special BRICS exhibition will showcase
the world cultural heritage of the five BRICS
countries and expose South Africans to the
global wonders of the world.
The Department of Arts and Culture is
focussing on the following areas that will
define South Africa’s Chairship of BRICS
2018 in relation to culture.

Institutional Collaboration/Exchange
Programme
During the BRICS Ministers of Culture Meeting
in China in 2018, an action plan was signed
and this plan together with letters of intent
on museums, galleries, national libraries and
children’s theatre present an opportunity to
increase the level of corporation between
BRICS countries’ cultural institutions. It is
through these institutions that professionals
and experts in various areas will be able to
engage each other, plan projects jointly and
share expertise and skills.
 A BRICS Working Group will be
established to provide the necessary stimulus
and engagement in between the BRICS
Summit and Ministers of Culture meetings.
The group, made up of senior government
officials and industry experts (co-opted), will
meet to develop joint projects and determine
policy issues for ministerial approval. This will
be a platform to share ideas and knowledge
systems to ensure that BRICS culture is
promoted among BRICS countries.
The institutional collaboration among
BRICS countries’ museums, children’s theatre
and libraries started in 2017. Letters of intent
were signed in 2017. The Department of Arts
and Culture is coordinating these institutions’
input regarding modalities and content. The
museum meeting is scheduled in China later
in the year and the library meeting will take
place in South Africa on the margins of the
BRICS Ministers Meeting in October.
 BRICS Ministers of Culture Meeting
The cultural programme will culminate in a
meeting of BRICS culture ministers in South
Africa in October 2018. The meeting will
discuss various issues related to culture and
creative Industries, including the adoption
of legacy projects and work towards the
finalisation of the BRICS Audio-Visual Co-
Production Treaty. Progress will be reported
to the ministers on collaboration in youth
theatre, libraries, galleries, museums
and film development. Exchanges and
training opportunities for artists and cultural
practitioners will be presented, with the
ministers providing leadership and direction
on BRICS cultural collaboration going forward.
The cultural partnerships between the
BRICS countries will provide ongoing
impetus as we consolidate our legacies,
through strengthening the cultural strands
and heritage that brought us together in the
earliest times as people were eager to form
networks, trade and exchange knowledge in
peace.
These are historical stepping stones
from Mapungubwe to the present, further
consolidated in our shared struggles for
national liberation, the spirit of internationalism
and the solidarity of the nations of the South.
The historical consciousness set off by earlier
generations inspires us to carry out our
present mission.
 Arts and culture build the mental
framework that strengthens our resolve and
provides our marching orders as we strive for
a better life for all. Together, we shall make
cultural industries a major cornerstone of our
relationship.
We are connected in many different ways,
through shared roads and waterways, through
markets and trade routes, through networks
of interchange and exchange and bound by
a common agenda of economic prosperity for
all our people.

R
apid urbanisation is a
worldwide phenomenon. In
Africa, projections are that in
2050, 60% of its people will
be urbanised, while in South
Africa the United Nations
(UN) estimates that 71% of the population
will be urbanised by 2030. This presents
challenges for sustainable and resilient
urbanisation.
South Africa is a signatory to various
global agreements on resilient urbanisation,
which we regard very highly. These include
the New Urban Agenda, adopted in 2016 in
Quito, Ecuador; Agenda 2030, on Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs); Agenda
2063, The Africa We Want; and the Sendai
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015
– 2030.
We submitted a progress report on
implementation of the six SDGs, which was
discussed recently at the UN High Level
Political Forum in New York.
In February this year, the delegation we
sent to the World Urban Forum in Malaysia
reported on progress with regard to the
implementation of the New Urban Agenda,
which we are embedding in our own local
policy, the Integrated Urban Development
Framework (IUDF), thus localising the New
Urban Agenda.
We are also aligning and positioning this
national urban policy in line with the SDG
Goal 11, which is to make cities and human
settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and
sustainable.
Our legislative review regarding disaster
management also factors in the Sendai
Framework and aligns it to these global

Our planning and legislation also factor in

Building urban resilience and ensuring
sustainable development demand integration
of urban governance, climate and risk-
sensitive development planning, as well other
systems, services and resources.
Both the New Urban Agenda and the IUDF
emphasise the importance of integrated
urban infrastructure planning for accessible
and sustainable services, which must also
bring together spatial and fiscally targeted
agreements for land use, human settlements
and public transport in particular.
South Africa is proud to be actively engaged
in all these processes as part of its own urban
agenda and sustainable development, and
looks forward to diverse perspectives from
this forum.
The BRICS Friendship Cities, Local
Government Forum took place under the
theme: “BRICS in Africa: Collaboration for
Inclusive Growth and Shared Prosperity in
the 4th Industrial Revolution”. The theme is
reflective of the core BRICS priority of the
creation of an inclusive society and global
partnerships that will bring prosperity to all
humankind.
Reflecting on the history of BRICS
cooperation preceding the 10th Summit, the
First Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC)
Summit, held in Russia in 2009, called for a
greater say and representation of emerging
markets and developing countries in
international financial institutions.
At the BRICS Leaders’ Summit, which we
hosted in 2013, the eThekwini Declaration and
Action Plan were issued, which committed to
setting up the New Development Bank (NDB).
Five years later, here in South Africa,
we celebrate the recently launched Africa
Regional Centre of the NDB, and the bank’s
Board of Governors is Chaired by our Minister
of Finance, the Honourable Nhlanhla Nene.
Importantly, the bank’s Strategy for 2017
– 2021 focusses on financing sustainable
development and infrastructure projects
in BRICS and other economically more
developed countries.
Physical infrastructure is a critical enabler
of faster, inclusive and sustainable economic
growth. However but, currently, infrastructure
investments needed in South Africa far
exceed available fiscal resources, affecting
municipal services as well.
Typically, just the energy, waste, water and
sanitation networks are responsible for nearly
50% of city budgets in South Africa. Research
shows that while capital requirement for
water services (and water resources) will
decrease with water demand management,
approximately R97 billion is still required to
rehabilitate existing assets.
To get infrastructure to suitable standards,
the South African Financial and Fiscal
Commission estimated that an additional
R4 billion per sector would be required
yearly for five years in the case of water and
sanitation, and for just under seven years in
the case of electricity.
Yet, infrastructure development is integral
to overcoming poverty and inequality, as well
as building environmental sustainability and
urban resilience, particularly in the light of
rapidly risen urbanisation rates.
A recent State of South African Cities
Report, entitled Toward Resilient Cities ,
indicated that sustainable infrastructure
approaches were starting to be adopted by
the country’s cities, and this was a promising
trend.
Moving towards a more inclusive urban
spatial form thus requires considerable long-
term planning; we must examine in more
depth, how sustainable and how realistic is
continuing state investment without sufficient
The role of technology in enhancing cities as centres of development
will enable us as emerging markets and developing nations to play
a more prominent role in stimulating inclusive growth and shared
prosperity. This gels well with the broader BRICS theme of being
positioned to take advantage of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

spatial modelling to inform these locational
investment decisions?
At national level, strategies are currently
being formulated to better guide our urban
infrastructure investments, with recognition
of the interface between the objectives of
the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the National
Industrial Policy, spatialised investment
planning and the implementation of the
country’s national urban policy.
 President Cyril Ramaphosa has
embarked on an investment drive targeting
US$100 billion in investment over the next five
years. South Africa will host an investment
conference in September to further advance
this goal.
At the 2016 World Economic Forum Annual
Meeting, held under the theme “Mastering
the Fourth Industrial Revolution”, the need to
prepare for this revolution was highlighted. The
Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised
by a range of new technologies that are fusing
the physical, digital and biological worlds,
impacting all disciplines, economies and
industries, and even challenging ideas about
what it means to be human.
The key questions are how do we create
meaningful collaboration through this
revolution, how can new technologies assist
the world to close a US$1 trillion annual
infrastructure investment gap, and design
long-term oriented investment frameworks to
create a sustainable future?
In line with the theme of the 10th BRICS
Summit, it is also important to mention that
research by the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development, World Bank
and others, highlight that new thinking in
industrial policy pays attention to spatial
outcomes of development processes to
address inequalities.
This means that we must critically examine
our own National Industrial Policy Action
Plan, which has a special focus on minerals
and beneficiation, agriculture and agro-
processing, energy, attracting investments
and growing the oceans economy – from
the perspective of spatial profiling that
understands and facilitates the location of key
growth points across regions.
Our strategies have to grow the economy
and bring social cohesion and spatial justice
to all our people.
Our urban policy, the IUDF, provides an
urban vision and policy for South Africa
and presents practical interventions for
implementing the policy.
These are premised on nine policy levers.
These levers provide entry points for planning
and implementing optimal city environments.
The key lever is for interdisciplinary spatial
planning and land-use management
practices that actively integrate infrastructure
investments, public transport and human
settlements as the baseline for the productive,
inclusive and liveable city.
These interventions are to be sustained
through building more inclusive urban
economies, improving the way that cities are
governed, strengthening the management of
city finances and empowering communities to
participate in urban design and form.
The IUDF addresses cross-cutting
levers, namely the promotion of urban-rural
interdependency, urban safety and urban
environmental resilience.
Our urban agenda commits us to action on
these levers through the mobilisation of “An
all of government, and a whole of society
approach”, which at the global level, invites
our BRICS partners to support and engage
with us on our mutual commonalities,
challenges and opportunities for cooperation
and collaboration.
The role of technology in enhancing cities
as centres of development will enable us as
emerging markets and developing nations
to play a more prominent role in stimulating
inclusive growth and shared prosperity. This
gels well with the broader BRICS theme of
being positioned to take advantage of the
Fourth Industrial Revolution.

n June 2018, the BRICS (Brazil, Russia,
India, China, and South Africa) deputy
ministers/special envoys on the Middle
East and North Africa (MENA) region
met in Pretoria. The purpose was to
exchange views on the current situation
in preparation for the 10th BRICS Summit of
Heads of State and Government, scheduled
to take place from 25 to 27 July 2018 in
Johannesburg. This meeting of the deputy
ministers and special envoys has established
itself as an integral part of BRICS.
 The Middle East and North Africa are
regions that since ancient times have had
rich civilizations, cultures and traditions,
contributing positively to advancements in
various facets of life, including science, arts,
culture, politics etc. The MENA region is now
at a critical juncture in its history, as its people
struggle to contain and resolve persistent
conflict, address the challenges of terrorism
and extremism and develop democracy.
The underlying causes of these conflicts are
deeply complex.
BRICS calls for peace,
stability and prosperity in
the MENA region
By Luwellyn Landers
Deputy Minister of International Relations and Cooperation
Since the 2011 uprisings, conflicts of
divergent origins across the Middle East and
North Africa have intersected and spread into
other regions. Some of these uprisings have
managed to develop into peaceful transitions
towards democracy. Others have remained
within the range of civil conflicts. Two have
become horrific civil wars; the unintended
consequences of which have spread and
affected the continental and international
geopolitical sphere.
Underlying our deliberations was the
commitment to the basic principle that
international peace and security should be
achieved and sustained solely in accordance
with, and in full respect of international law,
including the United Nations (UN) Charter,
with the UN Security Council (SC) bearing
the primary responsibility for maintaining
international peace and security. No effort to
undermine the multilateral system, however
imperfect and unreformed it might be, should
deter international cooperation at all levels to
prevent and resolve conflict and to create the
conditions for peace, stability, development
and prosperity.
There is no place for unlawful resorting
to force or external interference in any
conflict. Ultimately, lasting peace can
only be established through broad-based,
inclusive national dialogue with due respect
for the independence, territorial integrity and
sovereignty of each of the countries of the
MENA region. In our discussions, we reflected
on specific country situations, namely: Syria,
Libya, Iraq, Yemen, and the Middle East
Peace Process (MEPP), among others.
We as the BRICS deputy ministers/special
envoys remained concerned about the
situation in Syria and reiterated our support
for an inclusive “Syrian-led, Syrian-owned”
political process, which safeguards the state
sovereignty, independence and territorial
integrity of Syria, in pursuance of UNSC
Resolution 2254 (2015). We also gave our
support for the continuation of the important
work done in the context of the Geneva
Peace Talks. We furthermore welcomed key
BRICS calls for peace, stability and prosperity in the MENA region

contributions of the Astana Process, which
showed signs of positive developments on the
ground in the last few months, in particular the
creation of de-escalation zones and holding of
the Congress of the Syrian National Dialogue
in Sochi on 30 January 2018.
With regard to Libya, we expressed serious
concern about the political and security
situation in that country, highlighting the
extremely negative consequences for the
Middle East, North Africa and Sahel region.
We noted that the military intervention in
the country in 2011, led to instability, dire
humanitarian consequences and the spread
of terrorism, extremism and other criminal
activities in the region and beyond.
Notwithstanding these challenges, we
expressed our support for the continued
efforts of the UN Special Representative for
Libya, Ghassan Salame. We also reaffirmed
our support for the regional role players such
as the African Union High-Level Panel on
Libya, chaired by Congo’s President, Denis
Sassou-N’Guesso, to engage all Libyan
stakeholders in a constructive dialogue in
pursuance of the UN Action Plan for Libya,
announced in September 2017.
On Iraq, we welcomed the parliamentary
elections held in May this year, as well as the
complete liberation of territories in the country
previously occupied by ISIS. We hope that the
holding of and the outcome of these elections
will strengthen Iraq’s democratic institutions,
broaden dialogue, strengthen negotiations
and promote more peaceful political co-
existence. The international community must
continue to support the Government and
people of Iraq in their efforts to fight terrorism
and extremism.
With respect to Yemen, we expressed grave
concern about the ongoing conflict, which is
having a disastrous impact on human security
as well as regional stability. This conflict has
already led to unspeakable suffering among
the civilian population, including women,
children and the elderly. It has also resulted in
the wilful destruction of a significant part of its
essential services and infrastructure, resulting
in a major humanitarian crisis. We have
therefore as the BRICS deputy ministers/
envoys on MENA called for unhindered access
for the provision of humanitarian assistance
to all parts of Yemen in order to relieve the
health, social and economic situation in
this country. We also urge all parties to fully
respect international law, to cease hostilities
and to return to the UN brokered peace talks.
Furthermore, the UN Special Representative
Martin Griffiths’ efforts to restart talks among
all Yemeni parties must be supported. The
way forward to achieve peace, prosperity
and security in Yemen is through an inclusive
Yemeni-led dialogue towards the achievement
of a political solution to the conflict.
In our deliberations on the MEPP, we were
gravely concerned that, for years now, there
had neither been peace nor a real process.
The recent killings of over 100 Palestinians
and thousands more injured in Gaza by Israeli
troops have led to the situation becoming even
graver with dire humanitarian consequences
for the Palestinians, not only in Gaza and the
West Bank, but also within Israel itself. The
decision to move the United States Embassy
to Jerusalem has further aggravated the
situation.
In this regard, we were unanimous in
our resolve that the conflicts elsewhere in
the MENA should not be used as pretext to
delay the resolution of the long-standing
Palestinian-Israeli conflict. We reiterated
the need for renewed diplomatic efforts to
achieve a just, lasting and comprehensive
settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
This is important if we are to achieve peace
and stability in the Middle East with a view to
creating an independent, viable, territorially
contiguous Palestinian state living side by
side in peace with Israel.
The media statement we adopted at the
end of our meeting highlighted all these
serious realities we faced and specified how
we as BRICS countries intended to contribute
to resolving them. We will continue to hold
regular consultations on the MENA until there
is lasting peace, stability and prosperity in the
MENA region.

The year of Nelson Mandela, a
better Africa and a better world
A
s we celebrate the
centenary of Nelson
Mandela, it is imperative
that we remember that our
own destiny and future
can never be divorced
from that of the continent. From Nkwame
Nkruma in Ghana to our very own son of the
soil, Rolihlahla Nelson Mandela, one can only
marvel at the depth of wisdom and patriotism
that these thought leaders expressed in their
call for African renaissance in calling for unity
in diversity, peace and tolerance.
Our founding fathers of the Organisation of
African Unity (OAU), which is now the African
Union (AU), envisaged an African continent
that is independent, united, peaceful and
prosperous. This vision was exemplified
through the long struggle for liberation of the
Africa continent. While the primary agenda
of decolonisation has been realised, with
only Western Sahara still under the colonial
occupation by Morocco, the continent is still
lagging in terms of economic emancipation of
the African child.
We will continue to play our part in
conflict resolution in those countries that are
still plagued by pockets of instability and
conflict. In addition, South Africa reaffirms its
continued solidarity to assist the people of
Western Sahara in pursuit of their inalienable
right to self-determination and decolonisation.
South Africa remains steadfast in its rejection
of all acts of terrorism and extremism that
have increasingly affected countries on our
continent, contributing negatively to internal
instability.
It was anticipated that the readmission
of Morocco into the AU would expedite the
resolution of this dispute. However, the
contrary prevails. To this end, we will continue
to lobby all AU members and the broader
international community to expedite the
resolution of the Saharawi question.
As South Africa, we’ll also continue with
our conflict and mediation processes in South
Sudan until we find lasting peace to Africa’s
youngest nation.
This year marks 30 years of the battle of Cuito
Cuanavale, which Nelson Mandela regarded
as a milestone in the quest to end the tyranny
of colonialism and apartheid.
Our iconic leader, in reflecting on his
impressions of the Cuito Cuanavale battle
during his visit to Cuba on the occasion of
the 38th celebrations of the Moncada victory,
said:

Deputy Minister of International Relations and Cooperation
South Africa joined the Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC) formation to
advance our foreign policy objectives that are predicated on leveraging our
international agreements for domestic gains, and promotion of the African
Agenda and the Agenda of the Global South.

“I was in prison when I first heard of the massive
assistance that the Cuban internationalist
forces provided to the people of Angola, on
such a scale that one hesitated to believe,
when the Angolans came under combined
attack of South African, CIA-financed FNLA
mercenaries, UNITA and Zairean troops in
1975. We in Africa are used to being victims
of countries wanting to carve up our territory
or subvert our sovereignty. It is unparalleled in
African history to have another people rise to
the defence of one of us”.
We continue to be encouraged by the
internationalist spirit and character of the
Cuban people and we are forever indebted.
We have been elected to serve as Africa’s
rotational non-permanent member of the
United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for
the period 2019 to 2020. We will use this seat
to achieve Africa’s goals.
In carrying out the legacies of President
Mandela and OR Tambo of democracy and
equality, South Africa will also prioritise
the transformation of the system of global
governance based on African’s common
position, famously known as the Ezulwini
Consensus, to make the system more
responsive to the needs of the developing
countries and ensure fair representation in
global governance structures. The reform of
the UNSC thus remains a recurrent essential
element of South Africa’s overall effort to
reform the UN in order to make it more broadly
representative, efficient and transparent and
thus further enhance its effectiveness and
legitimacy.
In 2018, South Africa assumed the Chair of
the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) under the theme: “Partnering with the
Private Sector in Developing Industry and
Regional Value Chains”. We will continue to
focus on building our political and economic
integration of SADC states. We will continue
to strengthen peace, security, democracy and
development. It is also worth noting that the
SADC accounts for approximately 80% of our
total trade with the continent.
We welcomed the adoption and launch of
the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) in
Kigali in March 2018, as well as the signing of
the Kigali Declaration. The Kigali Declaration
served as a complementary political statement
of unity in purpose, symbolising a unified
commitment to conclude the outstanding
issues necessary for operationalisation and
full implementation of the CFTA.
As soon as we finalise the parliamentary
approval process, South Africa stands ready
to ratify.
Furthermore, we recognise that both SADC
and the Southern African Customs Union
are primary vehicles to regional economic
integration. They are important building blocs
to achieving the  Tripartite Free Trade Area
and the CFTA.
Additionally, the launch of the Single
African Air Transport Market as part of the
Agenda 2063 Legacy projects is indicative of
the development path the continent is striving
towards. This initiative will indeed contribute
towards the ease of travel and doing business
on the continent.
South Africa joined the Brazil, Russia, India,
and China (BRIC) formation to advance our
foreign policy objectives that are predicated
on leveraging our international agreements
for domestic gains, and promotion of the
African Agenda and the Agenda of the Global
South.
These objectives informed our continued
participation in the forum. In order to give
effect to the centrality of Africa in our foreign
policy through BRICS, we hosted the Fifth
BRICS Summit under the theme, “BRICS
and Africa: Partnership for Development,
Integration and Industrialisation”, in Ethekwini
in 2013.
We have again assumed the Chairship of
BRICS from 1 January 2018 and will conclude
this role on 31 December 2018. We understand
that our identity is not based on geographical
composition and that our engagement with
other formations must benefit the continent.
South Africa will host the 10th BRICS Summit
from 25 to 27 July 2018 under the theme:
“BRICS in Africa: Collaboration for Inclusive
Growth and Shared Prosperity in the 4th
Industrial Revolution”, which underscores
our commitment to Africa’s development and
prosperity.
The BRICS countries produce a third
of the world’s industrial products and one
half of agricultural goods. Furthermore, the
BRICS countries constitute 43% of the global
population and as such have a large human
resource base and a significant consumer
market. Member states such as South Africa
and India also enjoy a promising demographic
dividend.
South Africa also assumed the Chair of
the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) in
October 2017 and will continue until October
2019. It has been agreed that we will lead
this pre-eminent regional body linking Africa,
the Middle East, Asia and Australasia via the
Indian Ocean, based on the elements of our
theme of “IORA: Uniting the Peoples of Africa,
Asia, Australasia and the Middle East through
Enhanced Cooperation for Peace, Stability
and Sustainable Development”.
In collaboration with the new South African
Secretary-General of the association, we
will further strengthen its work programme,
particularly the IORA Action Plan (2017 –
2021), which South Africa is championing
to make the organisation more outcomes-
oriented. Importantly, we will create and
enhance the institutional mechanisms
necessary to advance important priorities for
South Africa and the region, such as women’s
economic empowerment; maritime safety and
security; the Blue Economy; and tourism.
Our work will also seek to align under
Operation Phakisa: Oceans Economy and
the AU’s 2050 African Integrated Maritime
Strategy with the overall focus of IORA on the
Blue Economy.
Africa remains home to some of the fastest-
growing economies in the world for 2018. This
positive economic outlook provides South
Africa with a unique opportunity to not only
drive investment in Africa, but also attract
investment from the continent. This approach
is in line with the announcement of President
Cyril Ramaphosa during the State of the
Nation Address to, among others, host an
Investment Summit during the year.
The Department of International Relations
and Cooperation is firm in its belief that both
the public and private sectors from across the
continent have an important role to play in this
important initiative.
Lastly, we must utilise our youth bulge for
the development and reconstruction projects
of the continent so as to realise other key
agenda activities that formed the basis of the
formation of the OAU/AU, which is prosperity
on the continent.
As such, all hands must be on deck to help
us usher in a new dawn for the continent, and
be true to Madiba’s counsel that South Africa
cannot escape its African destiny. And all of
us must also honour President’s Mandela’s
dream that: “I dream for an African which is at
peace with itself”.
All hands must
be on deck to
help us usher in a
new dawn for the
continent, and be

J
oin me on a journey to some very
special places in our country,
places that tell a remarkable
story for the whole world.
Let’s start our tour among
the rolling hills around Qunu
in the Eastern Cape. Scattered homesteads
are sometimes clustered into little villages
reached only by dusty, bumpy roads.
The cattle that you can see dotted around
the landscape would have been tended by
a young Rolihlahla Mandela as they grazed
all day long, nearly a century ago. There
would have been a small school in this area,
where a teacher bestowed the name “Nelson”
upon a young man, little knowing that he
was to become a universal symbol of the
spirit of humanity and reconciliation among
people. Places like these are not just about
picturesque hills and sparse dwellings. They
reveal layer upon layer of our history and
heritage. They reflect the thoughts and values
of leaders like Nelson Mandela, and convey
the collective consciousness of our people.
You can have an authentic interaction by
living in private homes and local lodges in
many rural communities like these. Here, you
can gain first-hand insight into how traditional
beliefs and cultural practices intermingle with
modern life. You can understand how the
history and hardships of our people guide
our aspirations to transform our economy
and bring marginalised communities into the
tourism mainstream.
This place was so important to former
President Mandela that he chose to return there
to retire, after leading a divided nation striving
to reconcile itself, and serving our country as
the world’s most revered statesman.
Let’s leave the quiet rural countryside of
Qunu for now, we will return later.
Let’s head north to Gauteng, to Soweto in
Johannesburg. It was here, in Vilakazi Street,
that Mandela lived in a small red brick house
typical of apartheid’s townships. Further down
the road, lived Desmond Tutu.
Together with church colleagues and
comrades in arms, Tutu and Mandela led the
long struggle to tear down the policies that
confined their people to live within their tiny
boxes.
Vilakazi Street became the heart of the
struggle against apartheid.
Today, the precinct is bustling with
restaurants and street vendors who depend
on the busloads of visiting tourists for trade.
It is the only street in the world that was once
home to two Nobel Peace Prize laureates.
Most visitors are international tourists, but
more and more of our people are starting to
experience the benefits of exploring their
own country as our domestic marketing and
promotional campaigns take root.
More tourist traffic through Vilakazi Street
means better prospects for the economy of the
precinct. Here, the layer of our historic social
struggle is interweaved with many economic
dimensions: the precinct supports jobs, small
businesses and many entrepreneurs. Tourist
guides, transport operators and vendors of
memorabilia all benefit from tourism.
The former home of Mandela, and the
Vilakazi Street precinct that developed around
it, demonstrate the power of tourism to convert
cultural heritage assets into tangible benefits
for communities today.
We leave the city of Johannesburg and
head for the quiet town of Howick in the
KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. It was here, along a
winding back road, that Mandela was captured
by security police, leading to the Treason Trial,
his imprisonment on Robben Island and the
remarkable transformation in our country
following his release.
The capture site is marked by an iconic
sculpture which gives visitors a sense of the
important historic event which changed the
course of our history so dramatically. The
tourism economy around the site is not as well
developed as that of Vilakazi Street, but it has
Madiba’s story is a journey across our land

81

become a must-see site for passing tourists.
That single moment in time, when a policeman
stopped a car driven by a man disguised as a
chauffeur, was to become a defining moment
in South Africa’s history.
Standing at the capture site, you feel the full
significance of that momentous event along
this very ordinary road.
From here, our journey follows Nelson
Mandela to the prison cell he occupied for
over two decades on Robben Island. A short
ferry ride from Cape Town takes you to the
island’s small harbour.
A tour of the prison conveys the hardship its
occupants were subjected to.
Standing in the cell that held Mandela
captive is an extraordinary, life-changing
experience.  You cannot stop thinking about
how someone who was confined to the
brutality of this place can emerge with such
humanity, even towards his captors.
This experience forces all of us to look deep
within ourselves, and to question our own
sense of humanity towards others. It forces
us to discover the Mandela within each of us,
and to express the values he espoused in
whatever ways we can.
The penultimate leg of our trip once again
follows the footsteps of Nelson Mandela,
this time from Robben Island to the Union
Buildings in Pretoria, where the prisoner
became the President.
On the front lawns, an imposing statue of
a smiling Nelson Mandela stretches out his
arms, protecting his people with the warmth
it exudes. It is a fitting tribute to Mandela the
man, the statesman and the father of our
democratic nation.
From here, we will make one more stop
before our journey ends. We return to a
traditional family gravesite at Qunu, to Nelson
Mandela’s final resting place.
As his family and comrades gathered
here to return his body to the very soil
that sustained his early life, the nation
resumed life without one of the greatest sons
of Africa.
But the story is far from over: Nelson
Mandela will be with us forever, through the
political legacy that brought freedom and
democracy for all in our country, and through
the many sites that continue to reflect on
momentous events in his life.
From Qunu to Vilakazi Street, from Howick
to Robben Island and Pretoria, and, finally
back to Qunu, a journey through these sites
brings our history and heritage to life.
I hope that many more South Africans will
be able to make this remarkable journey.
And I wish that corporate South Africa,
philanthropic foundations and others join hands
and work together to make the trip possible for
those who cannot afford to travel, especially
our youth. They will also return home with a
renewed sense of what these sites mean for
all of us in South Africa, and for humanity
all around the world. Experiencing the story
of Nelson Mandela, and understanding the
values and principles it reveals, makes each
one of us a better person, and this is what
makes the world a better place for all of us.
We end our journey as changed people,
with a deeper understanding of ourselves and
each other, fulfilling the ultimate purpose of
tourism.

In a coup for South Africa, the former Minister of Tourism, Tokozile Xasa, was elected one
of two deputy chairpersons of the Regional Commission for Africa (CAF) during the 22nd
General Assembly of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) in China
recently.
On the sidelines of the UNWTO General Assembly in Chengdu, held from 11 to
16 September 2017, Minister Xasa was appointed Deputy Chair of the CAF for a two-year
term alongside her counterpart from the Gambia, Amat Bah. Kenya’s Najib Balala was
elected to chair the regional commission, succeeding Zimbabwe’s Walter Mzembi.
The regional tourism commissions enable member states to meet once a year to discuss
concerns and formulate proposals to submit to the UNWTO for consideration.
“We extend our warm congratulations to Minister Xasa on this significant appointment. It’s
a vote of confidence in the vision and leadership shown by South Africa as a major tourism
player on the African continent and, indeed, on the world stage,” said South African Tourism’s
Chief Executive Officer, Sisa Ntshona.
“Furthermore, to be voted into this important position by her peers on the African continent
is an endorsement of Minister Xasa’s zeal in pushing the agenda of the African Union in
multilateral engagements, and her passion for championing women and small businesses
in the tourism sector. African tourism faces its own distinct opportunities and challenges,
and we have every confidence in her ability to articulate these on the global stage,” he said.

The role of the Sherpas can be seen as “informal” in
nature, but in terms of enhancing cooperation and
consensus-building, it is a critical one.

China and South Africa
formation (BRICS) in 2018,
will host the 10th BRICS
Summit from 25 to 27 July in
Sandton, Johannesburg.
As this will be a milestone summit,
culminating in a decade of BRICS cooperation,
the build-up thereto consists of many sectoral
meetings hosted by South Africa. The meetings
of the BRICS Sherpas/Sous-Sherpas are held in
preparation for the BRICS Leaders’ Summit.
South Africa hosted several meetings in
preparation for the BRICS Summit, providing
progress updates in respect of proposals made
previously, as well as presentations on new
initiatives. A key element in all these interactions
undertaken to prepare for the annual BRICS
Summit is the Sherpa. Often their role is not
publicised and not many know their key role/
function.
What is a Sherpa?
The role of the Sherpas can be seen as
“informal” in nature, but in terms of enhancing
cooperation and consensus-building it is a
critical one.
In the governmental and diplomatic arena,
a Sherpa is usually a senior official, often a
career diplomat, who has been appointed
by a Head of State or Government. They
are tasked with being their countries’
representatives in multilateral organisations

or fora. This is in respect of preparatory work
and coordination concerning their countries’
activities and events, linguistic inputs, as
well as positions on particular issues within
a particular organisation such as the G20,
BRICS or India, Brazil, South Africa (IBSA).
The Sherpas guide their principals in terms
of policy, agenda-setting for cooperation,
and the drafting of resolutions, declarations,
communiqués or statements. This entails
decisions taken at high-level meetings and/
or summits
Historical background
In attempting to trace the origins of the term
“Sherpa”, The Ascent of Sherpa”  by Nancy
Friedman (2013) refers to the momentous
historical milestone of the first humans to
summit Mount Everest, the highest peak in
the world. The ascent of Edmund Hillary from
New Zealand and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay of
Nepalese descent, on the morning of 29 May
1953 to the summit of Everest brought acclaim
to the Sherpa clan. Sherpa is the English
modification of a Tibetan word meaning
“dweller in an eastern country”, originally
referring to the Sherpa people, Asian nomads
who migrated from Eastern Tibet to Nepal.
The word is also used in the personal names
of the ethnic group.
According to Bruce Foreman’s The Sherpa
Cheat Sheet: 9 Things you were Embarrassed
to Ask” (2017), the word is pronounced “shar-
wa” by the Sherpa clan. Sherpas climb
and assist expeditions up the Himalayan
Mountains.
They prepare camps, the load and meals,
and they chart the course for the professional
climbers.
In essence, they conduct the risky part of
the enterprise by running ahead and setting
up the ropes and ladders in order to ensure
the safety of their clients and to enable them
to reach the summit.
Before going further with the explanation
of the term “Sherpa” within the realm of
diplomacy, it is important to understand the
origins of another term to which Sherpa is
often connected, i.e. Summit. The Oxford
English Dictionary  defines a summit as “the
highest point of the hill or mountain”.
Within diplomacy and politics, the term was
reportedly first used by Sir Winston Churchill.
(The Palgrave Macmillan Dictionary of
Diplomacy, 2003).
This was during the Cold War, in order to
describe a face-to-face meeting between
heads of state/government, especially at
a time when these meetings were a rare
occurrence.
Although the term “Sherpa” has been
used in various contexts, such as in fashion
or business, it has equally been used in the
diplomatic field, where the symbolism of
“reaching the top” is more pronounced.
Its origins in this regard date back to the
1970s (Michael Quinion, World Wide Words ,
2005). Thomas P Thornton stated that former
President Jimmy Carter was referring to
Ambassador Henry Owen in a self-effacing
statement in a letter, made in respect of the
latter’s contribution as a Sherpa in the Group
of Seven (G7) Summit preparations in 1977.
He wrote: “You did a superb job on the Summit
meeting in London. Your tremendous talents
Sherpas climb and assist expeditions up the Himalayan
Mountains. They prepare camps, the load and

really paid off. Thank you for letting me take
credit for your good work.” (Alan Beattie et al,
Sherpas are the Unsung Heroes at the G7
Negotiations, 2016)
The initiative of “Sherpas” preparing the
work ahead of the G7 Summit was a result
of the former French President Valéry
Giscard d’Estaing, who invited the leaders of
Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom
and the United States to meet in 1975. He
invited the leaders to appoint representatives
(from the foreign and finance ministries, as
well as note-takers) to meet ahead of time
for “fire-side chats” in order to prepare for
the “Summit”. The aim was to cut out the
“bureaucracy and formality” and to ensure a
relatively nimble decision-making apparatus
(Alan Beattie et al, 2016).
According to Friedman, the term "Sous-
Sherpa" (“sous”: a French word meaning
“under”) refers to the official/s who work
closely with the Sherpa – subject matter
experts in finance/economics or diplomacy
who report to the Sherpa. The word was
informally used first by the European Union
(EU) (taken from the term “sous-chef”).
The profile of a Sherpa
Although the role of the Sherpa is similar in
most of the multilateral organisations, the
differences pertain to what mandate or level
of authority/decision-making they are given by
their Head of State/Government.
This renders their roles different from
country to country and organisation to
organisation. Several articles noted the
following about what their role entails: among
others, that Sherpas “prepare leaders to scale
a summit”; have a “peculiarly discreet and
yet influential role”; and are “senior officials
working behind the scenes [who] do much of
the heavy lifting”.
The Sherpas also highlight possible
divergence and try to find convergence.
Therefore, they assist in resolving the
contentious issues ahead of the high-level
meetings. This eases the discussions at the
level of the Heads of State/Government when
they eventually meet at the “Summit”. The
Sherpas meet several times a year before
and after summits.

84
UBUNTU - BRICS SPECIAL www.brics2018.org.za
A Japanese G7 Sherpa is quoted as saying
that the Sherpas need to bond, therefore
their meeting locations “away from the
capital” create the right ambience for cordial
discussions.
This rests on the fact that they spend much
of their time negotiating face to face for days
at a time and, as such, a sense of teamwork,
fraternity and solidarity is necessary to
progress in their work and ensure that all
sensitive differences are worked out in
advance to ensure consensus and success,
while still protecting their nations’ sovereign
interests and status.
The BRICS Sherpas/Sous-Sherpas work
according to a Terms of Reference document
that outlines their levels of engagement
and sets the norms and standards for their
cooperation.
The Sherpas meet several times a year; at
least on five different occasions.
The First Meeting is usually an introduction
by the host country chairing in the particular
year. Conversely, the last meeting concludes
proceedings for the host country and a
handover is put into play for the next host
country.
The main Sherpas’ meeting is the meeting
preceding the BRICS Summit. They also meet
on the margins of the United Nations General
Assembly (UNGA) in New York ahead of the
BRICS Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. Sherpas
also meet prior to the informal meeting of
BRICS Leaders on the margins of the Group
of Twenty (G20) Summit.
The engagements in the G20 consist of two
channels: “a Sherpa track” and a “Finance
track”. The former is led by the foreign
affairs/international relations ministries of the
respective member states, while the latter is
driven by the finance or economic ministries.
The various member states have one
Sherpa each.
Depending on which country is the
“rotational Chair”, the frequency of their
meeting is the aforementioned five times a
year, including the meeting prior to the G20
Summit.
The Sherpas work on technical and policy
matters related to development, and the
Sherpa track itself consists of working groups.
The two tracks then meet to finalise the
G20 Communiqué that would be issued by the
Leaders as the outcome document at the G20
Summit. Like the BRICS Sherpas, the G20
Sherpas coordinate inputs regularly and meet
in various locations within the Chair’s country
to deliberate on the priorities and objectives
for the year and the implementation thereof.
In both instances, the agendas of the two
groupings have grown substantially and,
therefore, there are cross-cutting issues that
necessitate the Sherpas referring technical

issues to other officials and related agencies
at Head Office.
They have to be agile and keep learning
as new trends and issues are introduced as
subsets of the agenda.
A study conducted by Emmanuel Mourlon-
Druol et al  (2014), providing a comparison
of the G7/8 Sherpas who held the role from
1975 to 1991 (over 17 summits), provides
interesting insights into the characteristics of
a Sherpa, revealing the common traits as well
as differences.
The results of this study were published
in International Summitry and Global
Governance. The Rise of the G7 and

highlighted the following. The G7 Sherpas
are typically males in their mid-fifties, who
are mostly civil servants. The majority have a
diplomatic background, with some experience
working in an international organisation, while
others may have expertise in economics or
hail from academia. Their level of education
is usually at a doctorate level with a strong
research focus. Their tenure as Sherpas
often extends for a few summits, therefore
the continuity and their performance are well
regarded.
Conclusion
It is now clear to see that, just as Sir Edmund
Hillary (who was a professional and leader
in his own right) entrusted Sherpa Tenzing
Norgay to guide his expedition, Heads of
State/Government of multilateral fora such as
BRICS, the G20, the G7, and to some extent,
the EU in the case of “Brexit”, entrust Sherpas
to be their “personal representatives”.
Norgay was knowledgeable and
experienced, and assisted in the preparations
of the journey. He would take the risks and
safeguard his client.
The Sherpas in these fora are tasked with
a Tenzing Norgay-esque role within the arena
of politics and diplomacy. Their role is that of
laying the ground in a way that allows their
principals be successful in their “summits” or
talks, without the Sherpas themselves taking
any of the credit for the success achieved.
Their existence and goal is unequivocally one
of solid preparatory support and it is indeed
invaluable.

BRICS Brand is being

Chief Marketing Officer, Brand South Africa
S
outh Africa remains
committed to championing
the African development
agenda and uses
multilateral platforms such
as Brazil, Russia, India,
China and South Africa (BRICS)  to increase
strategic cooperation among emerging
market economies of the South in support of
this agenda.
South Africa’s interaction with the global
community is premised on its commitment
to creating a better South Africa in a better
Africa in a better world. Together with peer
BRICS members, South Africa advocates
for the transformation of systems of global
governance, and therefore remains open to
finding new and inspiring ways to cooperate
with global partners, through institutions such
as BRICS.
So, what does South Africa bring to
the table when it engages with peers at
multilateral fora such as BRICS. Recent
findings from the AT Kearney Foreign Direct
Investment Confidence Index  graded South
Africa the 25th top investment destination
as ranked by global business audiences.
During recent months the EY (Ernst & Young)
Africa Attractiveness Programme once again
indicated that not only did South Africa attract
the bulk of foreign direct investment (FDI)
destined for the African continent, but it was
also this year the fifth-largest source of FDI
in the African economy. Furthermore, South
Africa’s hard and soft infrastructures, its
diversified market, and the sophistication of
its financial and business sectors, provide
BRICS partners with a solid foundation for
either inward investment into our economy,
or to utilise South Africa as a springboard for
operations within the African continent.
Premised on this notion, South Africa
supports the Africa Development Integration
Agenda, which is underpinned by three critical
elements, namely: market integration, and
industrial and infrastructure development.
These pillars aim to address the critical
constraints facing Africa, which are small and
fragmented markets, inadequate productive
capacity as well as inadequate infrastructure
development.
South Africa’s membership of BRICS

deepening South-South relations with the aim
of not only supporting multilateral discussion
and exchange, but to open new channels
for trade, investment and mutual support in
challenging times.
To this end, we believe that BRICS has,
since inception, matured to become more
than an informal club of emerging markets,
but is graduating to becoming an international
institution to be reckoned with, which
can, through collective efforts and careful
coordination, effect tangible change in their
domestic and international environments.
As explored in a research report by Brand
South Africa in September 2015, BRICS as
a young multilateral organisation, has high
compliance levels by member states, which
are positive indicators that reaffirm that the
BRICS Brand is being developed and shaped
through cooperation among developing
nations.
In addition, it can be noted that through
the years, BRICS has developed several
interventions such as the Academic Forum,
the New Development Bank, Contingency
Reserve Arrangement and a host of
interventions aimed at bridging geographical,
linguistic and cultural barriers between the
nations. As a multicultural and multireligious
society, South Africa welcomes, and is open
to deepening these interactions.
Indeed, the BRICS countries have provided
significant opportunities for growth in the
global economy and have greater prospects to
do so in the future. It is evident that the size of
the BRICS economies, and their demand for a
prominent and influential political voice on the
international stage, make them particularly
relevant to the African continent’s regional
development and investment prospects
programme as outlined in Agenda 2063.
As we prepare to host the 10th BRICS
Summit under the theme “BRICS in Africa:
Collaboration for Inclusive Growth and
Shared Prosperity in the 4th Industrial
Revolution”, we as a nation stand ready to
contribute to inspiring the discussions on a
wide range of summit-level issues related to
global governance, aimed at the development
of humanity in pursuing the agenda for a more
equitable and fair world for all.
The hosting of the 10th Summit is therefore
a milestone for BRICS. As host country, South
Africa has enhanced efforts to significantly
increase inward investments as announced
by President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has put
in place a drive to attract US$ 100 billion over
the next five years. South Africa is open for
business and prioritises BRICS partners to
assist meeting this ambitious, but necessary
objective. The summit is a major opportunity
to create awareness among BRICS partners
about this investment drive, and the
opportunities it creates for increased trade
with South Africa.
The theme is reflective of the core priorities
of each of the BRICS members, notably to
strive towards the creation of an inclusive
society and global partnerships that will bring
prosperity to all humankind.
Team South Africa remains cognisant of
the work that needs to be done to ensure that
our country remains an attractive investment
destination. This is one of the messages we
would like to take to the BRICS Summit –
being that South Africa is not only open for
business, but that the country welcomes
increased cultural, economic, academic, and
societal interactions. South Africa believes
that we can enhance human development
through our economic and business relations
that we share with our BRICS members.
We are committed to the sustained growth
of the African continent, and our fraternity
in the continent transcends geographical
borders.

The BRICS Brand – from
economic concept to institution
of global
I
n a research report published during
2015, Brand South Africa began exploring
the development of Brazil, Russia, India,
China and South Africa (BRICS) and
its institutionalisation. It asked rather
speculatively whether BRICS could be
approached or analysed as as emerging
institution of global governance, and hence, a
brand in and of itself.
With South Africa hosting the 10th BRICS
Summit in 2018, Brand South Africa set out
to update the 2015 research with relevant
new information that appeared subsequently.
The 2018 report is entitled, The BRICS Brand
– From Economic Concept to Institution of
Global Governance.
It is found that BRICS nations have,
in a proverbial counter-cyclical fashion,
been increasing interaction, seeking more
opportunities for trade and deepened
interactions beyond state-to-state
engagements, covering several domains of
economic and socio-cultural action.
Dr Petrus de Kock
Brand South Africa, General Manager: Research
This is what leads some analysts to argue that,
in an ironic twist of geopolitical fate in the 21st
century, five developing nations are becoming
the protectors of free global trade, advocates
of globalisation, activists for protection of the
global climate and a force that advances the
cause of a just, equitable and an integrated
multipolar international order.
This report captures findings related
to three aspects interrogated through the
research, namely:
• firstly, the emergence of BRICS as an
institution in the global governance arena
• secondly, how the institutionalisation of
BRICS contributes to the development of
the BRICS Brand
• thirdly, how this BRICS Brand presents
a unique case of compound soft power,
or, as alternatively referred to, the
multilateralisation of soft power.
Essentially, this research explores how the
increased formalisation of intra- and inter-
BRICS interactions, the establishment
of institutions such as the BRICS New
Development Bank (NDB), and increased
interaction on platforms such as the Business
Council and Think Tank structures, also led
to the development of the BRICS Brand, or
collective image, of the five member states.
BRICSceptics tend to argue that due
to the diverse nature of member states’
internal composition, and geopolitical and
economic policy objectives, the organisation
may find it hard to cohere and develop. But,
contrary to such analyses, an important
strand of research on the BRICS is finding
that the geographic and internal diversity of
the member states are assets that in fact
strengthen cooperation, while congruently
increasing the soft power impact of BRICS
and individual member states.
The BRICS Brand is therefore an outcome,
or result, of several levels of concerted
effort by member states to institutionalise
interactions. For example, since inception,
The BRICS Brand is therefore an outcome, or result, of several levels of
concerted effort by member states to institutionalise interactions. For example,
since inception, the BRICS Research Group has found that there have
been more than 160 formal meetings between members and it adopted 60
documents, subsequently implemented through various working groups and
coordination mechanisms.
The BRICS Brand – from economic concept to institution of global

the BRICS Research Group has found
that there have been more than 160 formal
meetings between members and it adopted
60 documents, subsequently implemented
through various working groups and
coordination mechanisms.
Furthermore, between the 2009 and 2017,
the BRICS countries made a total of 406
commitments. The BRICS Research Group
furthermore finds a staggering high level
of compliance by BRICS members when
it comes to the implementation of summit
decisions. It is found that BRICS members
implement 70% of summit decisions. This
indicates high levels of commitment to making
BRICS a reality through deepened interaction.
Scholars are increasingly acknowledging
BRICS as a multilateral brand. The research
finds that this acknowledgement is a direct
result of increased institutionalisation.
Important in this regard is the analysis of
the soft power of the BRICS collective, and
how the institutionalisation of the group is
contributing positively to entrenching it as a
unique manifestation of global governance
in a volatile geopolitical and international
economic arena. Based on assessments
of BRICS, Chatin & Gallarotti (2016), for
example, argue:
“The bloc has also transformed into a
diplomatic forum representing increasing
power, value and capacity of action for the
member states, this attributing to them a
distinctive standing and an image associated
with a ‘special mark’. Along the same
lines, Montbrial stresses that the BRICS
have become a ‘real brand,’ to which the
states composing the group dedicate great
attention.”
In conclusion, it is found that this
research report links the following
concepts: institutionalisation of the BRICS,
its emergence as an institution of global
governance, soft power and the development
of BRICS as brand.
This means that as BRICS is
institutionalised; as it implements summit
decisions; as it establishes shared institutions
(e.g. the BRICS NDB); as it furthers the cause
of a multilateral, fair, just, and inclusive global
governance system; and as it seeks peaceful
resolution of international conflicts – it builds
the (BRICS) Brand, and enhances the soft
power of both the BRICS as institution, and
the individual member states.
However, developments in the global
economy and geopolitical environments,
play a major role in driving the search for
strengthened, deepened and institutionalised
BRICS interactions. The development
of the BRICS Brand (based on the
institutionalisation of the group) takes place
in a post-Global Financial Crisis world
characterised by turbulent change: increasing
trade protectionism (witness United States
imposition of import tariffs and overtures
of trade wars), isolationism and economic
nationalism (BREXIT and increasing
popularity of anti-European Union political
parties in Europe), anti-globalisation, and
epically destructive proxy conflicts in crisis-
prone regions (witness developments in
Ukraine, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, and to a
lesser degree Libya). The aforementioned
conflicts unfold in regional environments
already destabilised by decades of ongoing
external (often unilateral) interventions, and
internal civil and political conflicts in countries
such as Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, through BRICS interactions,
the member states have been putting their
proverbial money where their mouths are.
Consequently, BRICS countries have been
bucking trends of anti-globalisation and
counter-integrationist discourses that have
emerged in the northern hemisphere, and
in so-called “advanced nations” in the past
decade.
Furthermore, the anchoring principle and
shared vision of a multilateral and fair global
governance system sit at the heart of the
evolution of BRICS as global governance
institution and evolving brand.
Cedric de Coning argues that:
“No analyst foresaw, nor did the BRICS
themselves, that in less than a decade, these
actions would bring them to a point where
the BRICS has become an important force
in defence of global governance, economic
globalisation, free trade, and collective
climate action.”
This is due to the fact that nations which,
in the 20th century were advocates of
globalisation, free (unrestricted) global trade,
regional integration and a rule-based systems
of global governance, have made stunning
about-turns on such issues.

The above projects confirm that an
Aerotropolis is a launch-pad for investment
facilitation, creating a world-class destination
hub for airport transportation needs, including
passenger travel, cargo logistics and related
commercial, industrial and residential
enterprises.
Investment development facilitation
Here also lies the Ekurhuleni Investment
Centre, which has registered and facilitated
many large-scale projects valued at billions
of rands, and has the potential to create
hundreds of jobs over the coming years.
Not far from the  aerotropolis, plans
are underway to turn Germiston into an
administrative headquarters for the city,
with other precincts following a similar path.
Germiston was chosen very strategically and
for a number of reasons. Along with Kempton
Park and Boksburg, Germiston forms part of
what we dub the city’s economic triangle.
A significant portion of the City of
Ekurhuleni’s revenue is drawn from these
three nodes and there is an overconcentration
of industrial activity in these areas. The
Kempton Park-to-Germiston corridor will
become a new urban core and central
business district. Partnership between the
public and private sector will be important
in enabling these developments. With this
initiative and others like it, city planners are
expanding the horizon that will see Ekurhuleni
blossom into a prosperous region for all its
citizens.
Investment opportunities also exist for the
development of trade and exhibition spaces,
conferencing and hotels, leisure, retail and
residential estates, as well as industrial and
office parks.
Our Investment and Development
Facilitation Strategic Policy Framework
improves turnaround times in facilitating
and decision-making on investment and
development applications, thus improving the
city’s investment-friendly environment.
Financially sound
We have received two unqualified audits
and two clean audits from the Office of the
Auditor-General South Africa during the last
four years.
This is the ultimate seal of auditing approval,
and means that the city has passed the audit
test in three areas, namely: fair presentation
and absence of material misstatements in
financial statements, reliable and credible
performance information on predetermined
performance objectives, and compliance with
legislation governing financial matters.
Last year, the city was ranked top out of
the eight metros in South Africa, in an index
which allocated each municipality a score
out of 100 points based on five indicators:
audit outcome for 2014/15; whether it had a
permanent or acting municipal manager and
chief financial officer; how strictly it managed
its debtors; whether it under- or overspent its
2015/16 operational budget; and whether it
spent its conditional infrastructure grants that
fiscal year. In the rating index conducted by
the newspaper, Business Day newspaper, our
city came out tops with 81.9 points.
Also, the Moody’s Credit Rating confirms
that our investment profile remains healthy.
This means the city remains the opportune
and/or preferred destination for investment.
Energy efficiency
Accelerating energy efficiencies is key in
service delivery commitments. Our city
strives to improve the provision of electricity
to its citizens and other stakeholders. We
continuously work hard to realise that access
to affordable energy is one of the pillars
of South African life.  We promote major
investments in energy efficiency to stimulate
economic growth and create jobs across the
country.
The city’s energy capacity is stable and reliable
and there is enough energy to accommodate
all business, big or small, operating across
the city. In fact, our energy supply is bigger
than some provinces in South Africa and
bigger than some southern African countries
at around 2 500 Megawatts, which leaves us
with spare capacity for new investments.

Transport
As a metropolitan municipality, our role is to
make transport the heartbeat of the economy,
and continue to mobilise public- and private-
sector participation in transport projects
aimed at developing the city, province and
country’s economy.
The city boasts a world-class transport
network and our connectivity across rail,
road and air is significant. The Gillooly’s
interchange is the busiest in the southern
hemisphere, and Germiston railway hub is
one of the busiest on the continent.
We offer safe, affordable and reliable transport
services for our people through a bus rapid
transit system called Harambee, which has
changed the face of public transport in the
City of Ekurhuleni. Ekurhuleni is committed
to increased mobility for goods and services
to spur economic growth, a rising standard of
living and improved quality of life from which
our citizens will benefit.
University to expand skills
Plans are at an advanced stage to open a
university in our metro to serve as a fountain
from which we can draw the skills resources
to serve as the human capital that will drive
the development of our city. It will help to
systematically develop the knowledge base
and intellectual capital needed to improve
economic productivity, diversity and the
competitiveness of our city.
Among others, this intellectual resource is
needed to improve our industrial capabilities
in manufacturing and enhance the potential
of the region to become a city with the most
robust local manufacturing value chain with
a touch of modernisation to improve those
outdated industrial assets that our region
has while roping in new innovation and
entrepreneurship.
Our economic decisions are connected
to human values, which are based on
transparency and justice. We work according
to plans and goals for a prosperous growth
that will benefit individuals today and in the
future.
We believe in openness and economic
partnerships beneficial to all and we are open
to investments while deploying tools that will
make partnerships flourish and grow. With the
quality of life that is envied around the globe,
our city offers one of the most cost-effective
business and investment climates in the
world.
Let me invite all of you to be a partner in the
prosperous march of our city and this nation.
I can confidently assure you that you will truly
be happy that you took such a decision.

The City of Tshwane’s African
Sister Cities Initiative (ASCI):
Collaboration for Inclusive
Growth and Shared Prosperity
A
t the turn of the century,
scholars agreed that
Africa’s development
crisis was largely
characterised by policy
failure. One of the key
reasons for this failure was simply that Africans
had not conceived, owned and driven their
own policy agenda.  However, the combined
Africa is beyond bemoaning the past for its
problems. The task of undoing that past is ours,
with the support of those willing to join us in a
continental renewal. We have a new generation of
leaders who know that we must take responsibility
for our own destiny, that we will uplift ourselves only
by our own efforts in partnership with those who
wish us well. – Nelson Mandela
effect of commitment to transformation by
African governments (as embodied in the
African Union’s (AU) Vision 2063) and the
rapid rise in their economic growth rates
has brought about a change in global
perspectives on Africa within the first decade
of the 21st century. The vision has shifted
from the concept of a “hopeless continent” to
one of “ Africa rising”, as emerging evidence
documents the major transformations in the
region’s agricultural sectors and broader
economies. Today, the pace and scope of
transformation rest on enlightened policies
informed by solid evidence and constructive
engagement between African policymakers.
The fundamental questions at the core of
Africa’s future are linked to issues of political
governance – whether governments will adopt
policies and spend their scarce resources
in ways that truly promote growth across all
sectors – and mutual learning through greater
intra-Africa cooperation.
For this reason, the Executive Mayor of
Tshwane, Councillor Solly Msimanga, invited a
select group of mayors of African capital cities
to attend the ASCI side-event, Continental
Renewal through Ubuntu, in Pretoria on 7
June 2018. The purpose of this event was
to create a platform for strategic dialogue
around greater collaboration between African
capital cities across six thematic areas.

ASCI: Proposed areas of engagement
In keeping with the overarching Brazil, Russia,
India, China and South Africa (BRICS)
objective of peace, security, development and
cooperation, ASCI consists of six thematic
programmes that are designed to facilitate
actionable diplomacy that has a material
impact on the lives of Africa’s urban residents.
These programmes include the following:
ASCI-1: Facilitating Regional Trade and
Investment Programme
• The primary objective of the ASCI-1
programme is to facilitate continental
trade and investment opportunities for
local businesses in order to stimulate
employment opportunities across all
sectors.
ASCI-2:  Building Bridges: Towards Cross-
Cultural Understanding Programme
• As a means of addressing xenophobia at
its core, ASCI-2 will launch a campaign
that facilitates cross-cultural learning
and appreciation as a means of reducing
violence.
ASCI-3:  Enhancing Resilience to Climate
Change Programme
• Under the ASCI-3 programme, African
sister cities will measure and mitigate
greenhouse gas emissions through
partnerships on greening and clean
energy use, ensure food security through
the promotion of climate-smart urban
agriculture and safeguard water security
through the revitalisation of urban
watershed areas.
ASCI-4:Ensuring Safety and Security
Programme
• Through partnerships, ASCI-4 will not
only enhance cross-border tracking of
criminals, but also facilitate cooperation
among local police departments in African
sister cities.
ASCI-5:  Strategising for Health Programme
• By addressing the health gap from a
pan-African municipal level, through
evidence-based programming and policy
recommendations, this programme will
have a demonstrable impact on the equity
issues that surround access to healthcare.
ASCI-6:  Building an Educated and Skilled
Youth Programme
• Through the ASCI-6 programme, the
City of Tshwane will build continental
cooperation around capacity and skills
development for youth, through utilising
existing programmes and continental
initiatives.
ASCI: Ensuring mutually beneficial
collaboration
Through aligning with the BRICS spirit
of mutual respect and understanding of
our respective development paths, ASCI
will intentionally partner with Africa-based
institutions. For example, under the ASCI-1,
ASCI-3 and ASCI-6 programmes, the City
of Tshwane has partnered with the Regional
Network of Agricultural Policy Research
Institutes (ReNAPRI), Timbali and African
Business Energy (ABE) in order to develop
evidence-based, climate-resilient investment
strategies that will facilitate regional trade and
address the challenge of youth employment in
member cities.

UBUNTU - BRICS SPECIAL www.brics2018.org.za
ReNAPRI comprises regionally coordinated
agricultural policy think-tanks that were
established and are operating in select sub-
Saharan Africa member states . ReNAPRI
was created on the initiative of the national
agricultural policy institutes in order to enable
them to effectively coordinate with each other,
share data, collaborate on providing solutions
to the common challenges that face the
region, and to enable national policymakers
to learn from the experiences of other
countries. Through a baseline survey and
the development of a Monitoring and Impact
Evaluation Framework, ReNAPRI will provide
the necessary evidence that underpins public
and private investments under ASCI-1, ASCI-
3 and ASCI-6.
Timbali Technology Incubator has set up
small-scale farmers in sustainable businesses
since 2003. As a non-profit organisation, it
provides business development services
that include, but are not limited to, business
management, accounting and sales.
Technical skills, technology and clustering
(grouping farmers together to share services
and create bulk buying power) create the
ability for small-scale farmers to compete with
commercial farmers. Timbali also assists with
their route to market, ensuring that farmers
sell products and get a good amount paid
into their accounts, which is linked closely to
careful financial planning and other business
skills. Timbali’s holistic model provides more
than training – it mitigates all risks that a
small-scale farmer faces. As a result, 100% of
Timbali’s farmers remain operational through
the first year of business. Collaborating under
ASCI-1, ASCI-3 and ASCI-6, Timbali seeks to
develop new agri-incubators in urban areas.

grown rapidly, advancing from a partnership
to a strategic partnership and, finally, a
comprehensive strategic partnership. It is
convincing proof of the high mutual political
trust, based on mutual respect and win-win,
over the years.
As Ambassador Manelisi Genge, Chief
Director for East Asia and Oceania at South
Africa’s Department of International Relations
and Cooperation (DIRCO), put it, the
relationship has grown in this short time into
“one of the most important partnerships” for
the African nation. Ambassador Genge made
such comments at an event to celebrate the
20th anniversary of the diplomatic relations
between the two countries.
Statistics show that the economic
cooperation between China and South Africa
has made significant achievements over
the years. China has for nine consecutive
years remained South Africa’s largest trading
partner. China is also South Africa’s largest
source of foreign investment.
On the other hand, South Africa is China’s
biggest trading partner and the most important
destination for Chinese investment in Africa.
In 2017, bilateral trade grew by 11,7% to
US$39,17 billion, a more than 20-fold increase
from the figure at the beginning of diplomatic
relations in 1998. Chinese investment in
South Africa has grown from zero to an
accumulative total of over US$20 billion of
direct investment, reaching thousands of
businesses in South Africa.
The year 2017 saw South Africa and China
strengthening friendship through the inaugural
South Africa-China High-Level People-to-
People Exchange Mechanism, which took
place in Pretoria in April.
It was the first of its kind on the continent.
The two countries hope that the mechanism
will deepen mutual understanding between
the peoples of South Africa and China, and
enhance people-to-people exchanges and
cooperation in the areas of culture, education,
communication, health, science, technology,
sports, tourism, women and youth.
Moreover, an increasing number of South
African students will study in China under
a Beijing-sponsored programme, whereas
China accounts for the largest number of
international visitors to South Africa.
There are recent reports about South
African youth shining in China, one of whom
is University of Johannesburg graduate,
Boithabiso Mokoena.
Together with two partners, Mokoena
formed Thrive Beijing (www.thrivebj.com),
an online platform that profiles young
professionals thriving in Beijing, helps
professionals network or draws attention
to their businesses, as well as highlighting
places to see and events never to be missed.
That shows how our young generations are
engaging robustly and enthusiastically with
each other.
China and South Africa have also been
working closely under Brazil, Russia, India,
China and South Africa (BRICS).
Over the past 10 years, BRICS has proven
to be an important global bloc, and is far more
relevant now than it has been at any other
time since its formation, says Professor Anil
Sooklal, South Africa’s BRICS Sherpa as
well as Deputy Director-General of Asia and
Middle East at DIRCO. As major emerging
economies, BRICS countries work together
not only for the benefits of their own people,
but also seek to reform the unjust global
political and economic system.
This year marks the centenary of the great
leader of the South African and African people,
and the world at large, Nelson Mandela. This
year also marks the 20th anniversary of
China-South Africa diplomatic ties.
With South Africa hosting the 10th BRICS
Summit in July and China the Forum on
China-Africa Cooperation in September, the
two countries will again be on the focus on
the global stage.
Looking forward, we hold no doubt that the
China-South African relationship will embrace
a brighter future.

digital campaign called CEOs Know.
The campaign was in collaboration with
Business Leadership South Africa with the

objective of positioning South Africa as an
ideal investment destination.
The CEOs Know  Campaign featured
various CEOs from multinational corporations
based in South Africa, who shared insights
behind their continued investment into South
Africa.The campaign featured, among others,
South African Tourism CEO, Sisa Ntshona; the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange CEO, Nicky

Head of Anglo American South Africa, Andile

of Total.
The campaign probed into the overarching
question: “Why invest in South Africa?” and
showcased inspiring stories as told by the
respective CEOs, who uncovered facts that
were not commonly known about investing
in South Africa, thereby highlighting South
Africa’s competitive strengths as an attractive
foreign investment destination.
Commenting on the campaign, Brand
South Africa said: “This campaign came
at a time which saw the private and public
sector in collaborative efforts to strengthen
and accelerate progress in building a more
prosperous and equitable South Africa.
“For this campaign, we took a word-of-
mouth approach with private-sector CEOs,
as it was a critical indicator in influencing
business decisions to invest in any country.
This translates to how their respective
organisations then contribute and respond
to South Africa’s economic growth and
development”.

of Shell South Africa, on the company’s as
well as the petroleum industry’s impact on the
nation’s economic development.
Mloto said: “The industry contributed
approximately R330 billion to the country’s
economy in 2016 in terms of revenue, and of
that, at least R83 billion went into taxes and
duties of the country, which is a significant
contribution to the economy.”
In relation to South Africa as an attractive
investment destination, Mloto said that the
country’s well-regulated market guaranteed
foreign investors returns on their investments
into South Africa. The South African Nation
Brand continues to be the largest recipient
of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the
African continent, and is the largest source of
intra-regional investment – this is in addition
to having recently made a comeback in the
top 25 most attractive global investment
destinations.
“The recent political change and
developments have been positively received
by the industry and by our sector in particular.
President Cyril Ramaphosa has brought
a positive sentiment for reaffirming policy
certainty and he seems to be pro-business,
which has been positively received by the
markets.
“South Africa is finding itself in a positive
trajectory, both economically and politically;
this is inspiring as we are all now facing the
right direction to do our best in contributing to
the development of our country,” concluded
Mloto.
Shell has been active in South Africa since
1902. The company’s main business activities
in South Africa include retail and commercial
fuels, lubricants and oils, aviation, marine,
manufacturing and upstream exploration.
Throughout its long association with South
Africa, Shell has played an important role in
the country, not only as a premier oil company,
but also as a committed corporate citizen and
change agent.
Pierre-Yves Sachet, MD and CEO of Total,
said the industry’s successes were as a result
of the country’s conducive investment climate.
“South Africa is a great place for investment
for various reasons due to the numerous
incentives that are in place, and the most
iconic of these has to be the 28% company
tax, which is probably one of the lowest in the
entire Africa parameter.”
South Africa’s constitutional democracy, rule
of law, exemplary judiciary which continues
to demonstrate high levels of resilience and
the country’s prudent fiscal management and
monetary policies, sound financial system,
and world-class infrastructure indicate that the
country remains the continent’s leading (FDI)
hub. These are all aspects which Sachet says
are important in fostering FDI to South Africa.
“South Africa has always been and remains
one of the countries where the rule of law and
independence of justice are respected and
they work, and this is important for foreign
investors,” adds Sachet.
Established in 1954 in South Africa, Total
has grown its business in more than 130
countries. Total is now a major player in the oil,
gas and chemical industries. Its shareholders
and employees come from a diverse range
of backgrounds. The Total Brand’s presence
in the southern African region is made up
of Total South Africa, Total Namibia, Total
Botswana, Total Swaziland and Totalgaz.
Toyota SA explains is continued
investment into South Africa
South Africa’s vehicle market remains the
biggest in Africa, accounting for 37% of new
vehicle sales on the continent. Andrew Kirby,
President and CEO of Toyota South Africa
Motors, attributes this to the direction that
the South African Government has taken to
make South African an attractive investment
destination.
“The automotive sector is a bright spot
for us in South Africa because we have
long-term stability of the industrial policy
from government, and over the years, there
has been consistent support from the motor
industry,” said Kirby.
“The benefit for us is that we get asset
investment support, and we also get support
through the Automotive Production and
Development Programme, which incentivises
the production and exports of vehicles, which
allows us to offset a lot of the initiation costs,
and that makes us globally competitive.”
The Johannesburg Stock Exchange leads
by example
Brand South Africa also interviewed Nicki
Newton-King, the CEO of the Johannesburg
Stock Exchange (JSE) who shared her
thoughts on why the JSE led by example.
“We are really proud of the way the JSE
leads by example; we have world-class
financial markets in a developing economy –
something that takes many of our international
clients by quite considerable surprise. The
JSE is also one of the world’s top 20 equity
markets, one of the world’s top 10 derivatives
markets, and one of the world’s top 5 bond
markets.”
The JSE continues to dominate the sub-
Saharan Africa region, representing 38%
of all listed companies and 83% of total
market capitalisation in the region in 2012. In
fact, 68 of sub-Saharan Africa’s 100 largest
companies in terms of market capitalisation
are listed on the JSE, including the five
largest companies in Africa. In addition to
being the most advanced stock exchange in
the region, the JSE is also among the global
top 20 of exchanges in market capitalisation
and turnover. With a market capitalisation of
159% of GDP in 2012, South Africa also has
one of the largest equity markets in the world,
relative to the size of its economy.
Touching on the transition in political
leadership which led to Cyril Ramaphosa
being elected as President of the Republic,
Newton-King said that this change had
brought about a sense of renewed hope – not
only for South Africans, but also for foreign
investors.
“When foreign investors have come to
talk to us recently – they started out with the
question ‘is the political change for real’ and
what we are able to confidently tell them is
that this change had imbued our people with
a real sense of home and optimism. They ask
us about the rule of law, and whether or not
we all respected their rights and of course we
proudly said that we had one of the world’s
most respected constitutions and one of the
most respected judiciary – and these were
enormously positive things to say about our
country.
“This country is the most extraordinary place
to live in, there is a beat that you wake up to
every single day. I am inspired by the diversity
that we have as a competitive advantage in
this country,” concluded Newton-King.
Tourism sector is attractive for foreign
direct investment
“There is no other sector in the country that
is showing 8% growth per annum,” said Sisa
Nthsona, CEO of South African Tourism.
Commenting on the industry as a key driver
for South Africa’s economy, Ntshona said that
the tourism sector accounted for 9% of South
Africa’s GDP, and an estimated 8,5 % of the
continent’s GDP, up from 6,8% in 1998.
“From a business and development
perspective, tourism is a significant contributor
– which in turn translates to job creation. 2016
was a record-breaking year, with 10 million
international tourists coming to South Africa
South Africa is best known for its beach
and safari holiday experiences. Stunning as
the coastline and the game parks are, there
are plenty more on offer to tourists, both in
South Africa itself, and in the wider southern
African region.
 Ntshona said, however, that “South Africa
is more than just the 3 Bs (the beach, the
berg and the bush)”, stating that the country’s
secret weapon was its diversity and people.
South Africa an ideal investment destination: CEOs know

“I am constantly inspired about how South
Africa fights above its weight. South Africans
are ambitious, driven and passionate people.
We are a diverse people who love out country,
and our space and we want to share our home
with the world for them to be part of our ever-
growing story,” concluded Ntshona.
And it’s not just South Africa – the entire
continent is set for a tourism boon. Speaking
at the launch of Indaba in 2017, Africa’s top
travel trade show, Ntshona predicted that
Africa would be the new tourism frontier. He
reported that the continent had an 8% surge
in international arrivals in 2016, with Sub-
Saharan Africa increasing by 11% and South
Africa by 13%.
“South Africa has investment opportunities
across the economic spectrum”
Sasol Limited CEO and Joint President,
Bongani Nqwababa, joined the list of
multinational CEOs who provided testimonials
on Brand South Africa’s CEOs Know
Campaign on why their corporates continued
to invest in South Africa, while highlighting
South Africa’s competitive strengths as an
attractive foreign investment destination.
Nqwababa said that he was inspired by how
resilient South Africans were as well as their
ability to overcome adversity. The country is
a great investment destination because it not
only has opportunities in the resources, but
also has opportunities across the economic
spectrum.
Sasol is an international integrated
chemicals and energy company that
leverages technologies and the expertise of
30 300 people working in 33 countries. The
multinational develops and commercialises
technologies, and builds and operates world-
scale facilities to produce a range of high-
value product stream, including liquid fuels,
chemicals and low-carbon electricity.
Sasol was established in 1950 in South
Africa and it remains one of the country’s
largest investors in capital projects, skills
development and technological research and
development.  The company is listed on the
JSE in South Africa and on the New York
Stock Exchange in the United States.
“As the most industrialised country
in southern Africa, South Africa offers
opportunities for companies to grow
domestically and also for them to expand
into the African continent. From an FDI
perspective, South Africa is a wonderful place
to invest in for a variety of reasons – our legal
system is developed, our courts and judiciary
are independent, we have sound financial
systems and well-developed local capital
markets,” said Nqwababa.
“Africa is the next large growth region for
the world”
“Transformation and innovation is the name of
the game and that is what inspires me about
South Africa and the African continent,” said
Goldman Sachs Partner and MD, Head of
Investment Banking in Sub-Saharan Africa,
Colin Coleman.
Coleman shared his insights on what
made South Africa an attractive investment
destination during his interview with Brand
South Africa for the CEOs Know Campaign.
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a
leading global investment banking, securities
and investment management firm that
provides a wide range of financial services to
a substantial and diversified client base that
includes corporations, financial institutions,
governments and individuals. Founded in
1869, the firm is headquartered in New York
and maintains offices in all major financial
centres around the world.
The South African Government’s Invest
SA initiative, which formalised a relationship
with the World Bank to improve the country’s
ease of doing business, coupled with a
dynamic and stable economy, solid economic
fundamentals, prudent fiscal management
and monetary policies were distinguishing
factors that made South Africa an ideal
investment location, said Coleman.
A recent assessment by Goldman Sachs
indicates that South Africa is part of the “next
big emerging market story” of 2018. It notes
that the growth cycle is picking up after an
earlier downturn in investment growth. It says
that improved confidence is likely to lead to a
better outlook for growth and investment.
This is confirmed by the South African
Economic Update,  released recently by the
World Bank. While the economy’s performance
is improving, it notes that higher growth
will require ambitious structural policies. It
estimates that a successful conclusion of the
Mining Charter deliberations, for example,
could increase investment in the sector by
25%.
“South Africa is the hot emerging market
for 2018 because it stands out in the
post-transition of the Presidency to Cyril
Ramaphosa as an environment which offers
opportunity. This political change together
with the President’s economic policy give a
clear roadmap as to where South Africa is
going,” said Coleman.
President Ramaphosa recently announced
that a central priority for government this year
was to encourage significant new investment
in South Africa’s economy. Investment is
necessary for the growth of the economy
and the creation of jobs on a scale that
will significantly reduce current levels of
unemployment.
Coleman noted that South Africa’s modern
market environment had seen South African
companies venturing into the African continent
to expand operations and had also afforded
global corporates the opportunity to establish
their business in South Africa.
“We at Goldman Sachs see South Africa
as a base for our African business and so
do many other multinationals – and this is
attributed to a sound institutional framework
built on the foundation of a constitutional
democracy, sound regulatory framework as
well as commercial and legal practices, which
are line with those in the rest of the developed
world.
“All of these attributes position the country
positively and it is through the independence
of institutions that the nation will be able
to maintain business confidence,” added
Coleman.”   Brand South Africa
“As the most
industrialised
country in southern
Africa, South Africa
offers opportunities
for companies to
grow domestically
and also for
them to expand
into the African
continent. From an
FDI perspective,
South Africa is a
wonderful place
to invest in for a
variety of reasons
– our legal system
is developed, our
courts and judiciary
are independent,
we have sound
financial systems
and well-
developed local
capital markets.”

Experience an untouched world of perfect
hushed silences and raw wildlife moments
Here in the South African wilderness, you begin your journey into the soul of
Africa. It’s one that engages all your senses from the very first moment, sparked
to life when you first hear the distant roar of a lion, the laugh of a hyena in the
night, or the song of thousands of cicada beetles at midday. Then experience the
heightening of these senses when you first spot a rare leopard hidden in a tree,
or feel the ground vibrate as a herd of giant elephants cross right in front of you.
With the ever-present sun shining on your face, (or on the brim of your safari
hat) the South African wild is yours to explore. Leave your trip in the hands of a
friendly game ranger, an expert on absolutely everything there is to know about
the wild, who’ll charm, intrigue and leave your head spinning with the facts
and fascinating myths of the world you’re entering. Start the day the way nature
intended, at the crack of dawn, to see the wild residents emerge for a drink from
the busy waterhole as the sun begins to rise over the iconic bushveld scenery.
Then with your trusty guide by your side, track a herd of buffaloes as they amble
along the great open expanses. And after a day of never-to-be-forgotten sights
and safari moments, it’s time to return to the warmest embrace of luxury lodges
and some of the friendliest hosts around. When you’ve eaten enough for a family
of elephants and shared all your favourite stories of the day, it’s finally time to
drop into bed and be lulled to sleep by the sounds of the bush.
Whatever experience you’re after, South Africa has accommodation for any
budget – from luxury lodges to camping under a million stars. And it’s not just
classic bushveld safari like you know it; our wildlife experiences spread through
lush forests, wetlands, beaches, rivers and deserts. Choose from guided game-
vehicle tours, to relaxing walks, horseback and river safaris or take it all in from
the air as you fly over the landscape in a hot air balloon.
You’ll soon feel that this world moves at its own speed, and to witness it and be
part of it is something you won’t forget. Coming this close to nature is a vivid
reminder of why we have always been inspired by the untouched wild.
Free the adventurous spirit within.
Come play!
Stepping up to the edge of the world’s highest bridge bungee jump, your heart
hammers in your chest as your eyes widen at the site of the valley way down
below. Then, you go for it! You push forward from the bridge, dropping down
at what feels like a million miles an hour, into the gorge beneath you. The wind
roaring in your ears, your heart pounding even more now than ever, and all
your senses are electrified. You are flying free. Then with a tug, you’re swinging
back up towards the sky, catching your breath as you get ready to experience it
 all over again on the next plunge. You’ll never feel more alive than this. It’s like
walking a couple of inches taller than everybody else on the planet, and you’re
never looking back. This is what adventure tourism in South Africa does to you.
It’s these feelings that come with every experience that stick with you forever.
The awesome people you meet along the way or who share the thrill with you
make these memories even sweeter.
If you want to tick some items off the bucket list, this is the place to do it.
Take on your first shark-cage diving experience, and stare straight into the eyes
of a majestic Great White shark. Try adventuring along South Africa’s famous
rivers, in white-knuckled rafting experiences, cruising gently in some places
before simply roaring past the riverbanks in a frenzy of white-water adrenalin.
These are no everyday moments.
Then prepare to have your mind boggled by thousands of migrating sardines,
followed closely by hungry dolphins and other fish, during the world-famous
Sardine Run. Or get the hiking boots on and head out on the popular and
challenging Otter, dolphin or Tsitsikama Falls hiking trails, or climb to the top
of Table Mountain to see thousands of indigenous plant species and a view
of Cape Town that will stay with you forever.
Whatever your pleasure, South Africa is an endless outdoor playground that will
make you feel alive and free. From skydiving to quad biking, hot air ballooning
to windsurfing, treetop zip lining or sailing along the coastline – there’s no
shortage of raw adventures and “wow” moments surrounded by some of the
world’s most beautiful scenery.
Meet the Rainbow Nation in buzzing cities
bursting with colour and life
While the frenetic energy of a big city always commands attention, an African city
like Johannesburg does more than that – it takes you by the hand and leads you
into the heart of a place that constantly surprises, invigorates and charms, where
the unexpected becomes the reality.
South Africa’s City of Gold is where you’ll feel true urban energy packed with local
colour, flavour and soul. Hang out with the trendiest locals at street-side cafes,
overlooked by contemporary apartment blocks, or get the taste buds revved
up and ready to try everything you can see or smell at weekend food markets,
aroma-filled coffee shops or some of the finest restaurants on the continent
that are dotted throughout the city. There’s always something happening on the
streets, among Jozi’s high-rise buildings. Join genuinely fun and friendly urban
South Africans for a cocktail on packed rooftop bars, or meet them at art galleries
and spaces brimming with culture and expression. This is a place like no other,
where you can create some of your most vivid memories while making a whole
lot of new friends.
Just a short flight away, there’s Cape Town, one of the world’s favourite cities, a
place so beautiful, one picture is enough to sell it to anyone. In this stunning
city, the locals almost outshine the sights and their famous mountain, with a
reputation to keep you smiling, chatting and dancing throughout your stay. Don’t
miss the chance to take in some jazz at the city’s acclaimed international festivals,
and prepare to be mesmerised by local musicians and the rhythms that define
this city. Then sneak away for a picnic, or an unforgettable open-air concert at
the Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden, the most peaceful setting imaginable, hidden
against the slopes of Table Mountain.
And city life doesn’t stop there; this country has plenty more remarkable cities
to explore, like Durban on the semi-tropical east coast, where beachlife lives in
perfect harmony with an energetic modern city, or feel perfectly at home in the
historic coastal city of Port Elizabeth, known as the “Friendly City” to us.
Every South African city has its own unique story to tell, and the best people to
tell those stories are the locals themselves. So, let them be your guide to all the
hot spots, dance spots, taste experiences and best-kept secrets around the cities
they call home.
Take a journey of discovery from the roots of
all humanity to a human story that inspired
the world
It was here that the world’s human story first began, a staggering four million
years ago. Today a World Heritage Site, South Africa’s Cradle of Humankind
stands as humbling evidence of the earliest origin of modern humans, who lived
and evolved here at the tip of the continent before spreading to the rest of the
world. This is where it all started, and we can’t wait to welcome you home.
The spirit of ancient Africa can still be seen today at the site of the lost Iron Age
Kingdom of Mapungubwe, an advanced civilisation famous for its gold, which
was traded as far as Asia hundreds of years ago. That spirit lives on in culture,
tradition and myths, none more fascinating than the Limpopo province’s Rain
Queen Modjadji who still rules today.
Journey back to a time of war in KwaZulu-Natal, and walk the haunting
battlefields where the mighty Zulu Kingdom fought under the reign of the warrior
King Shaka Zulu. Then meet the proud Zulu culture of today at one of many
cultural villages, and be charmed by their famous animal prints, art, food and
traditions passed down over centuries. Of course, you can’t leave South Africa
without immersing yourself in the inspiring story of Nelson Mandela. Follow his
footsteps from humble beginnings at Mvezo in the Eastern Cape to his former
home in Soweto and on to the tiny prison cell on Robben Island where he spent
18 of his 27 years in prison.
While South Africa embodies our most ancient roots, we have evolved into an
amazing mix of modern cultures. Share in the truly South African urban and rural
settings that celebrate our diversity and way of life, like buzzing urban markets,
famous townships like Soweto, cosmopolitan bars filled with contemporary beats
and good times, theatres, jazz clubs and traditional restaurants to mention a few.
Diversity is South Africa’s proud legacy, and you are invited to become part of the
celebration of all nations and cultures by meeting and sharing a South African-
style handshake and more than a few memories with those who call this place
home.
To be in South Africa is to feel part of a story that goes back to the start of our
shared humanity, the first chapter of our story and everyone else’s, and to be
welcomed back “home” not as a traveller, but as a friend.
Free your imagination and let the waves lift
your soul, all along our sun-soaked coast
There’s nothing more amazing than getting right up close to a hundred
dancing and diving dolphins, their splashes speckling your camera lens with
water. Nothing stops time like the explosion of sound and feeling of pure awe
as a Southern Right whale breaches the blue ocean just meters away from you.
No moment is more dreamlike than standing in frozen silence, witnessing baby
loggerhead turtles hatch in the moonlight and make their awkward way to the
ocean for the very first time. These are the moments that make South Africa
special. And there are plenty more of them to be witnessed and experienced
along our 2700km of coastline.
It’s more than just the place where the cool Atlantic and warm Indian Oceans
meet. It’s where the folklore of fishing communities is as charming and real today
as it ever was; where perfect beaches lure you into staying all day and the freshest
flavours of the sea are piled onto your plate at seaside restaurants or right there
on the sand, while the smell of the ocean fills your lungs.
Explore South Africa’s natural wetlands where fauna and vegetation range from
thickets and woodlands to marshes, forests and reed: home to hippo, crocodiles,
black rhino, thousands of fish and bird species that go on with life just like they
have for thousands of years. Be a welcomed guest in their world, go hiking along
famous trails, crossing secret beaches, jumping over hidden rock pools and
stopping to watch ocean sunsets with only the waves for company.
Come experience beach days that feel like they should never end and the finest
beach-side hotels to spoil you when they eventually do. South Africa’s sun-
soaked coast lies ready, all-year round, to share its secrets, adventures and lazy
days with you.

See where breathtaking nature stretches out in
every direction to horizons that never end
Among mountains that look like they’ve been painted on the horizon and wide
open panoramas that run further than your eyes can see, an elastic thread of
tarmac transports you through a country that shifts and changes right before
your eyes. From some of the world’s most ancient landscapes like the awe-
inspiring plains of the lonely Karoo to the Limpopo bushveld and the incredible
Tsitsikamma Forest, secluded beaches or the valleys of some of the most beautiful
winelands you will ever see, you can’t help but feel you are somewhere special.
Let us introduce you to our places of wonder that make us swell with pride and
take our breaths away again and again. Come stand at the top of the mesmerising
Blyde River Canyon and feel your eyes try in vain to take in every inch of this
enormous artwork of nature. Crane your neck up to see the mind-blowing peaks
of the Drakensberg Mountains rising above you like gigantic castle towers and
explore the world’s largest collection of ancient San Rock Art preserved on their
rock faces and hidden caves. And, if you stick around for the cool winter months
you might get to see these famous mountains capped in pure white snow. From
here, follow the path of their foothills into the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands and get
lost in a world of artists’ villages, cool streams, farms dotted with plump cattle and
friendly guesthouses all enriched with African culture and locals who absolutely
love sharing their beautiful part of the country.
Every day in scenic South Africa ends with a horizon to look out on. Whether
you enjoy it with friends, welcoming locals or just by yourself as you contemplate
the world going by, it’s sure to create the kinds of memories that will stay with
you forever.

King Shaka Zulu. Then meet the proud Zulu culture of today at one of many
cultural villages, and be charmed by their famous animal prints, art, food and
traditions passed down over centuries. Of course, you can’t leave South Africa
without immersing yourself in the inspiring story of Nelson Mandela. Follow his
footsteps from humble beginnings at Mvezo in the Eastern Cape to his former
home in Soweto and on to the tiny prison cell on Robben Island where he spent
18 of his 27 years in prison.
While South Africa embodies our most ancient roots, we have evolved into an
amazing mix of modern cultures. Share in the truly South African urban and rural
settings that celebrate our diversity and way of life, like buzzing urban markets,
famous townships like Soweto, cosmopolitan bars filled with contemporary beats
and good times, theatres, jazz clubs and traditional restaurants to mention a few.
Diversity is South Africa’s proud legacy, and you are invited to become part of the
celebration of all nations and cultures by meeting and sharing a South African-
style handshake and more than a few memories with those who call this place
home.
To be in South Africa is to feel part of a story that goes back to the start of our
shared humanity, the first chapter of our story and everyone else’s, and to be
welcomed back “home” not as a traveller, but as a friend.
Free your imagination and let the waves lift
your soul, all along our sun-soaked coast
There’s nothing more amazing than getting right up close to a hundred
dancing and diving dolphins, their splashes speckling your camera lens with
water. Nothing stops time like the explosion of sound and feeling of pure awe
as a Southern Right whale breaches the blue ocean just meters away from you.
No moment is more dreamlike than standing in frozen silence, witnessing baby
loggerhead turtles hatch in the moonlight and make their awkward way to the
ocean for the very first time. These are the moments that make South Africa
special. And there are plenty more of them to be witnessed and experienced
along our 2700km of coastline.
It’s more than just the place where the cool Atlantic and warm Indian Oceans
meet. It’s where the folklore of fishing communities is as charming and real today
as it ever was; where perfect beaches lure you into staying all day and the freshest
flavours of the sea are piled onto your plate at seaside restaurants or right there
on the sand, while the smell of the ocean fills your lungs.
Explore South Africa’s natural wetlands where fauna and vegetation range from
thickets and woodlands to marshes, forests and reed: home to hippo, crocodiles,
black rhino, thousands of fish and bird species that go on with life just like they
have for thousands of years. Be a welcomed guest in their world, go hiking along
famous trails, crossing secret beaches, jumping over hidden rock pools and
stopping to watch ocean sunsets with only the waves for company.
Come experience beach days that feel like they should never end and the finest
beach-side hotels to spoil you when they eventually do. South Africa’s sun-
soaked coast lies ready, all-year round, to share its secrets, adventures and lazy
days with you.

See where breathtaking nature stretches out in
every direction to horizons that never end
Among mountains that look like they’ve been painted on the horizon and wide
open panoramas that run further than your eyes can see, an elastic thread of
tarmac transports you through a country that shifts and changes right before
your eyes. From some of the world’s most ancient landscapes like the awe-
inspiring plains of the lonely Karoo to the Limpopo bushveld and the incredible
Tsitsikamma Forest, secluded beaches or the valleys of some of the most beautiful
winelands you will ever see, you can’t help but feel you are somewhere special.
Let us introduce you to our places of wonder that make us swell with pride and
take our breaths away again and again. Come stand at the top of the mesmerising
Blyde River Canyon and feel your eyes try in vain to take in every inch of this
enormous artwork of nature. Crane your neck up to see the mind-blowing peaks
of the Drakensberg Mountains rising above you like gigantic castle towers and
explore the world’s largest collection of ancient San Rock Art preserved on their
rock faces and hidden caves. And, if you stick around for the cool winter months
you might get to see these famous mountains capped in pure white snow. From
here, follow the path of their foothills into the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands and get
lost in a world of artists’ villages, cool streams, farms dotted with plump cattle and
friendly guesthouses all enriched with African culture and locals who absolutely
love sharing their beautiful part of the country.
Every day in scenic South Africa ends with a horizon to look out on. Whether
you enjoy it with friends, welcoming locals or just by yourself as you contemplate
the world going by, it’s sure to create the kinds of memories that will stay with
you forever.

Athens, Bucharest, Cairo, Istanbul,
Jerusalem, Harare and Helsinki. We
are six hours ahead of New York; six
hours behind Beijing, eight hours
behind Sydney and just an hour
ahead of London.
The country does not apply daylight
saving, so it’s relative time remains
constant.

operate until 17:00 on Saturdays and
15:00 on Sundays.

volts AD 50HZ except in Pretoria
(230V) and Port Elizabeth
(200/250V).
Most plugs are three or two pin
and adaptors can be purchased.
US appliances may need a
transformer. Most hotel rooms
have 100 volt outlets for electric
shavers and appliances.
South Africa has an average
internet connection speed of
3.4Mbps. Many restaurants,
hotels, libraries and shopping
malls have Wi-Fi accessibility.

"The Cradle of
Humankind"

Population: For 2017, Statistics South Africa
estimated the mid-year population at 56,52
million. Approximately 51% (approximately
28,9 million) of the population was female.
Life expectancy:  Life expectancy at birth
is estimated at 59,7 years for males and 65,1
years for females
Languages: The country is multilingual
with 11 official languages, each of which is
guaranteed equal status. Most South Africans
are multilingual and able to speak at least
two or more of the official languages. The
languages are: Afrikaans, English, isiNdebele,
isiXhosa, isiZulu, Sepedi, Sesotho, Setswana,
siSwati, Tshivenda and Xitsonga. Attention
is also paid to the Khoi, Nama and San
languages and to sign language.
Religion: South Africa is a secular democracy
with freedom of religion. Many religions
are represented in the ethnic and regional
diversity of the population. The majority of
South Africans or 79,8%, are Christian.
Land surface area: 1 219 602 km2
Capitals:Pretoria (administrative); Cape
Town (legislative); Bloemfontein (judicial).
The Constitutional Court is located in
Johannesburg.
Provinces: Eastern Cape, Free State,
Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo,
Mpumalanga, Northern Cape, North West and
Western Cape.
Currency: Rand (ZAR) – 100 cents equals

South Africa is a country where various
cultures merge to form a unique nation proud
of its heritage.
The country boasts some of the world’s
most breathtaking scenery and features an
amazing display of bird- and wildlife species,
which include the Big Five (lion, leopard,
elephant, buffalo and rhino). South Africa’s
biggest assist is its people – a rainbow nation
with rich and diverse cultures.
South Africa is often called “The Cradle of
Humankind” for this is where archaeologists
discovered 2,5-million-year-old fossils of our
earliest ancestors, as well as 100 000-year-
old remains of modern man.
Geography
South Africa occupies the southernmost tip
of Africa. The country stretches latitudinally
from 22° to 35° S and longitudinally from 17°
to 33° E. Its surface area is 1 219 090 km2.
The country has common boundaries with
Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, while
Mozambique and Swaziland lie to the north-
east.
Completely enclosed by South African
territory in the south-east is the mountain
kingdom of Lesotho.
To the west, south and east, South Africa
borders on the Atlantic and Indian oceans.
Isolated, some 1 920 km south-east of
Cape Town in the Atlantic, lie the Prince
Edward and Marion islands, annexed by
South Africa in 1947.
The country’s physical features range from
bushveld through deserts and forests, up
majestic mountain peaks and down to wide
unspoilt beaches and coastal wetlands.
The oceans
South Africa’s largest neighbours are the
Atlantic and Indian oceans, which meet at the
southwestern corner of the continent.
The warm Mozambique-Agulhas Current
skirts the east and south coasts as far as
Cape Agulhas, while the cold Benguela
Current flows northwards along the west
coast as far as southern Angola.
The contrast in temperature between these
two currents partly accounts for important
differences in climate and vegetation between
the east and west coasts of South Africa.
The coastline stretches more than 3 000 km
and is an even, closed one with few bays or
indentations naturally suitable for harbours.
Climatic features
Although the country is classified as semi-
arid, it has considerable variation in climate.
The subtropical location, on either side
of 30° S, accounts for the warm temperate
conditions so typical of South Africa, making
it a popular destination for foreign tourists.
Being in the southern hemisphere, the
seasons in South Africa are opposite to those
of Europe and North America.
The country also falls squarely within the
subtropical belt of high pressure, making it dry
with an abundance of sunshine.
Although Durban (east coast) and Port
Nolloth (west coast) lie more or less on the
same latitude, there is a difference of at least
6° C in their mean annual temperatures.
Temperature conditions in South Africa
are characterised by three main features:
they tend to be lower than in other regions
at similar latitudes, for example, Australia,
due primarily to the greater elevation of
the subcontinent above sea level; despite
a latitudinal span of 13°, average annual
temperatures are remarkably uniform
throughout the country; and there is a striking
contrast between temperatures on the east
and west coasts. Owing to the increase in the
height of the plateau towards the north-east,
there is hardly any increase in temperature
from south to north.
Temperatures above 32° C are fairly
common in summer, and frequently exceed
38° C in the lower Orange River Valley and
the Mpumalanga Lowveld.
Spring: September, October, November
Summer: December through February
Autumn: March, April, May
Winter: June through August
Population
For 2017, Statistics South Africa estimated
the mid-year population at 56,52 million.
Approximately 51% (approximately 28,9
million) of the population was female.
Gauteng comprises the largest share of the
South African population. Approximately 14,3
million people (25,3%) live in this province.
KwaZulu-Natal is the province with the
second largest population, with 11,1 million
people (19,6%) living in this province. With
a population of approximately 1,21 million
people (2,1%), Northern Cape remains the
province with the smallest share of the South
African population.
About 29,6% of the population is aged
younger than 15 years and approximately
8,1% (4,60 million) is 60 years or older. Similar
proportions of those younger than 15 years
About south africa
i

live in Gauteng (21,1%) and KwaZulu-Natal
(21,1%). Of the elderly aged 60 years and
older, the highest percentage 24,0% (1,10
million) reside in Gauteng. The proportion
of elderly persons aged 60 and older is
increasing over time.
Government system
South Africa is a constitutional democracy
with a three-tier system of government and an
independent judiciary.
The national, provincial and local levels
of government all have legislative and
executive authority in their own spheres, and
are defined in the Constitution as distinctive,
interdependent and interrelated.
Operating at both national and provincial
levels are advisory bodies drawn from South
Africa’s traditional leaders.
It is a stated intention in the Constitution that
the country be run on a system of cooperative
governance.
Government is committed to the building
of a free, non-racial, non-sexist, democratic,
united and successful South Africa.
Parliament consists of the National
Assembly and the National Council of
Provinces (NCOP). Parliamentary sittings are
open to the public. Several measures have
been implemented to make Parliament more
accessible and accountable.
The National Assembly consists of no fewer
than 350 and no more than 400 members,
elected through a system of proportional
representation for a five-year term. It elects
the President and scrutinises the executive.
The NCOP consists of 54 permanent
members and 36 special delegates. The
purpose of the NCOP is to represent the
interests of the provinces in the national
sphere of government.
Constitution
South Africa’s Constitution is one of the most
progressive in the world and enjoys high
acclaim internationally. Human rights are
given clear prominence in the Constitution.
The Constitution of the Republic of
South Africa of 1996 was approved by the
Constitutional Court on 4 December 1996 and
took effect on 4 February 1997.
The Constitution is the supreme law of the
land. No other law or government action can
supersede the provisions of the Constitution.
Judicial system
The judicial authority in South Africa is vested
in the courts, which are independent and
subject only to the Constitution and the law.
No person or organ of State may interfere with
the functioning of the courts, and an order or
decision of a court binds all organs of State
and people to whom it applies.
The Constitution provides for the following:
• Constitutional Court
• Supreme Court of Appeal
• high Courts, including any High Court of
Appeal that may be established by an Act
of Parliament to hear appeals from high
courts
• magistrates’ courts
• any other court established or recognised
in terms of an Act of Parliament, including
any court of a status similar to either high
courts or magistrates’ courts.
Other courts include: Income tax Courts, the
Labour Court and the Labour Appeal Court,
the Land Claims Court, the Competition
Appeal Court, the Electoral Court, divorce
courts, small claims courts, military courts and
equality courts.
Decisions of the Constitutional Court, the
Supreme Court of Appeal and the high courts
are an important source of law. These courts
uphold and enforce the Constitution
International relations
South Africa’s unique approach to global
issues has found expression in the concept
of Ubuntu. This concept informs the country’s
particular approach to diplomacy. This
philosophy translates into an approach to
international relations that respects all nations,
peoples and cultures. It recognises that it is in
South Africa’s national interest to promote and
support the positive development of others.
South Africa therefore accords central
importance to:
its immediate African neighbourhood and
continent
working with countries of the South
to address shared challenges of
underdevelopment promoting global equity
and social justice
working with countries of the North to
develop a true and effective partnership for a
better world
doing its part to strengthen the multilateral
system, including its transformation, to
reflect the diversity of nations and ensure its
centrality in global governance.
By prioritising Africa and promoting its
renewal, development and reconstruction,
South Africa is contributing to building a
better Africa, which is the central foreign
policy goal of the South African Government.
After the democratic elections in 1994,
South Africa ceased to be the pariah of the
world; it regained its rightful place in Africa,
in the United Nations (UN) and in the family
of nations. South Africa emerged as a
democratic country into a fundamentally
transformed world with a visionary foreign
policy that promotes relations with other
countries.
South Africa maintains diplomatic relations
with countries and international organisations
through 124 missions in 107 countries abroad,
and through the accreditation of more than
160 countries and international organisations
resident in South Africa. The diplomatic and
consular missions implement South Africa's
foreign policy to enhance its international
profile and serve as strategic mechanisms
for the achievement of national interest.
South Africa is a member of various regional,
continental and international organisations.
Economy and finance
South Africa is a dynamic and stable economy
with solid economic fundamentals. It has
a sound financial system, highly regulated
banking sector, world-class infrastructure and
is investor-friendly. The country has the most
diversified economy on the continent and
advocates for Africa’s advancement.
The implementation of the National
Development Plan (NDP) is the cornerstone
of the country’s democracy. As the strategy
for reducing unemployment, inequality and
poverty by 2030, the NDP provides a strong
platform for collaboration among business,
government, labour and civil society.
The plan promotes enhanced
competitiveness, expanded infrastructure,
greater spatial efficiency in growing cities and
accelerated rural development. It prioritises
measures to build a capable, effective
state that delivers services to citizens while
encouraging business investment and growth.
Transport
South Africa has a modern and well-developed
transport infrastructure. The air and rail
networks are the largest on the continent, and
the roads in good condition. The country’s
ports provide a natural stopover for shipping
to and from Europe, the Americas, Asia,
Australasia and both coasts of Africa.
South Africa’s three major international
airports are OR Tambo International Airport
(Johannesburg); Cape Town International
Airport; and King Shaka International Airport
(Durban). There are also many regional
airports, including the Kruger Mpumalanga
International Airport in Mbombela (Nelspruit).
Public transport in major cities include the
Gautrain between Johannesburg and Pretoria
and the Bus Rapid Transport System in Cape
Town, Johannesburg and Pretoria.
Mineral wealth
South Africa’s mineral wealth translates into,
among others, 96% of known global reserves
of platinum-group metals, 74% of chrome,
80% of manganese, 25% of vanadium and
11% of gold reserves.
 Mining is one of the centres of South
Africa’s economy.

are many world-class private hospitals and
medical centres around the country, especially
in the urban areas, while many state hospitals
also offer excellent care, among them Groote
Schuur Hospital in Cape Town.
Most of South Africa is malaria-free, but
visitors to the Kruger National Park or low-lying
parts of northern KwaZulu-Natal are entering
malarial areas and should take precautions in
the form of prophylactic medication.

South Africa’s provinces:
A world in one country
South Africa has nine provinces, which vary considerably in size. The smallest is
tiny and crowded Gauteng, a highly urbanised region, and the largest, the vast,
arid and empty Northern Cape, which takes up almost a third of South Africa’s
total land area.
S
outh Africa has been aptly
described as a microcosm
of the world, a place where
civilisations meet. With its
spectacular views, stunning
wildlife and unbeatable
biodiversity in contrast with its bustling
modern cities, and vibrant economy, South
Africa is often described as “A world in one
country.”
The country has more than 290
conservation parks. It is home to almost 300
mammal species, about 860 bird species, and
8 000 plant species.
The annual sardine run is the biggest
migration on the planet.

South Africa has nine provinces, which vary
considerably in size. The smallest is tiny and
crowded Gauteng, a highly urbanised region,
and the largest, the vast, arid and empty
Northern Cape, which takes up almost a third
of South Africa’s total land area.
Each province has its own Legislature,
Premier and Executive Council. The
country has common boundaries with
Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, while
Mozambique and Swaziland lie to the north-
east. Completely enclosed by South African
territory in the south-east is the mountain
Kingdom of Lesotho.
Eastern Cape
The Eastern Cape, lying on the south-eastern
South African coast, is a region of great
natural beauty, particularly the rugged cliffs,
rough seas and dense green bush of the
stretch known as the Wild Coast.
In the Eastern Cape, various floral habitats
meet. Along the coast, the northern tropical
forests intermingle with the more temperate
woods of the south.
The province is serviced by airports situated

Hare to form a nucleus of olive production in
the Eastern Cape.
The coastal areas receive good summer
rainfall and have a moderate climate,
becoming more subtropical to the north-
west, which makes it particularly suitable for
forestry.
The basis of the province’s fishing industry
is squid, some recreational and commercial
fishing for line fish, the collection of marine
resources, and access to line-catches of
hake.
Industry
There are two industrial development zones:
the West Bank in East London and Coega,
near Port Elizabeth, which includes the
deepwater Port of Ngqura.
The metropolitan economies of Port
Elizabeth and East London are based

The coastal belt is also a large producer of
subtropical fruit and sugar, while the farmers
in the hinterland concentrate on vegetables,
dairy and stock farming.
Another major source of income is forestry
in the areas around Vryheid, Eshowe,
Richmond, Harding and Ngome, which is also
known for its tea plantations.
Limpopo
South Africa’s northernmost province shares
borders with Mozambique, Zimbabwe and
Botswana, making it the ideal gateway to
Africa. Named after the Limpopo River that
flows along its northern border, the province
is rich in wildlife, natural beauty and historical
and cultural treasures.
The province is linked to the Maputo
Development Corridor through the
Phalaborwa Spatial Development Initiative,
which is a network of rail and road corridors
connected to the major seaports, opening
up Limpopo for trade and investment. This
is complemented by the presence of smaller
airports in centres such as Phalaborwa and
Musina, as well as the Gateway International
Airport in Polokwane, the capital city, which
lies strategically in the centre of the province.
The Great North Road, running through
the centre of the province, strings together
a series of towns such as Bela Bela, with
its popular mineral spa; Modimolle, with
its beautiful Waterberg mountain range;
Mokopane; Polokwane; Makhado, at the foot
of the Soutpansberg mountain range; and

baobab trees. The crossing into Zimbabwe is
at Beit Bridge.
Phalaborwa and Thabazimbi are Limpopo’s
major mining centres, while the town of
Tzaneen in the picturesque Magoebaskloof is
known for its tea plantations, forestry products
and tropical fruit.
The province is in the Savanna Biome, an
area of mixed grassland and trees, generally
known as bushveld. Natural resources include
more than 50 provincial nature reserves and
several private game reserves. The largest
section of the Kruger National Park is along
Limpopo’s eastern boundary, which borders
on Mozambique.
Several museums and national monuments
bear testimony to the ancient people and
fearless pioneers who braved the unknown.
Living museums include the Bakone
Malapa Museum near Polokwane and the
Tsonga Open-Air Museum near Tzaneen.
Mapungubwe (“Place of the Jackal”) Hill,
some 75 km from Musina, is a world heritage
site. It served as a natural fortress for its
inhabitants from about 950 AD to 1200 AD.
Agriculture
Limpopo produces a wide range of agricultural
products. The area is a potato belt and known
for its superior quality potatoes for high-end
markets. It also produces 75% of the country’s
mangoes; 65% of its papayas; 36% of its tea;
25% of its citrus, bananas and litchis; 60% of
South Africa’s provinces: A world in one country

116
UBUNTU - BRICS SPECIAL www.brics2018.org.za
its avocados and two thirds of its tomatoes.
Other products include coffee, nuts, guavas,
sisal, cotton, tobacco, sunflower, maize,
wheat and grapes. In addition, more than 170
plantations produce timber.
Most of the higher-lying areas are devoted
to cattle and game ranching, earning a
reputation for quality biltong (salted, dried
meat), which is a popular South African
delicacy.
Industry and mining
Limpopo also has abundant mineral
resources, making mining the critical sector
of the province’s economy by contributing
22% of the gross geographic product. Metals
include platinum, chromium, nickel, cobalt,
vanadium, tin, limestone and uranium clay.
Other reserves include antimony,
phosphates, fluorspar, gold, diamonds,
copper, emeralds, scheelites, magnetite,
vermiculite, silicon, mica, black granite,

The Medupi Power Station, a new dry-
cooled, coal-fired power station, is under
construction near Lephalale. It is expected to
create around 40 000 job opportunities.
Mpumalanga
Spectacular scenic beauty and an abundance
of wildlife make the province one of South
Africa’s major tourist destinations.
Mpumalanga, which means “Place Where
the Sun Rises”, is home to just more than four
million people. The principle languages are
Siswati and isiZulu.
With a surface area of only 76 495 km2, it is
the second-smallest province after Gauteng,
yet has the fourth-largest economy in South
Africa.
Bordered by Mozambique and Swaziland
in the east, and Gauteng in the west, the
province is situated mainly on the high
plateau grasslands of the Middleveld. In the
north-east, it rises towards mountain peaks
terminating in an immense escarpment.
In some places, this escarpment plunges
hundreds of metres down to the low-lying
area known as the Lowveld.
The province has a network of excellent
roads and railway connections, making it
highly accessible. Owing to its popularity as
a tourist destination, Mpumalanga is also
served by a number of small airports, including
the Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport.
Mbombela is the capital of the province
and the administrative and business centre
of the Lowveld. Other important towns are
eMalahleni, Standerton, Piet Retief, Malalane,
Ermelo,
Barberton and Sabie, which lies in the
centre of one of the largest man-made forests
in the world. Mpumalanga lies mainly within
the Grassland Biome. The escarpment and
the Lowveld form a transitional zone between
this grassland area and the Savanna Biome.
The Maputo Corridor, which links the
province with Gauteng, and Maputo
in Mozambique, facilitates economic
development and growth for the region.
Agriculture and forestry
Mpumalanga is a summer-rainfall area divided
by the escarpment into the Highveld region
with cold frosty winters and the Lowveld
region with mild winters and a subtropical
climate.
The escarpment area sometimes
experiences snow on the high ground.
Thick mist is common during the hot, humid
summers.
Agriculture, as the backbone of the
province’s economy, employs 8,1% of its
total workforce. An abundance of citrus fruit
and many other subtropical fruit – mangoes,
avocados, litchis, bananas, papayas,
granadillas, guavas – as well as nuts and a
variety of vegetables are produced here.
Mbombela is the second-largest citrus-
producing area in South Africa and is
responsible for one third of the country’s
orange exports. The Institute for Tropical and
Subtropical Crops is situated in the city.
Groblersdal is an important irrigation area,
which yields a wide variety of products such as
citrus, cotton, tobacco, wheat and vegetables.
Carolina-Bethal-Ermelo is mainly a sheep-
farming area, but potatoes, sunflowers, maize
and peanuts are also grown there.
Industry and manufacturing
Most of the manufacturing production in
Mpumalanga occurs in the southern Highveld
region; especially in Highveld Ridge, where
large petrochemical plants such as Sasol 2
and Sasol 3 are located.
Large-scale manufacturing occurs
especially in the northern Highveld
area, particularly chrome-alloy and steel
manufacturing. In the Lowveld subregion,
industries concentrate on manufacturing
products from agricultural and raw forestry
material. The growth in demand for goods and
services for export via Maputo will stimulate
manufacturing in the province.
Mpumalanga is rich in coal reserves with
eMalahleni being the biggest coal producer
in Africa. South Africa’s major power stations
are situated in this province. Kendal Power
Station’s cooling towers are the largest structures
of their type in the world. The Kusile Power
Station near Delmas, which was completed
in 2016, is the country’s biggest, contributing a
massive 4 800 MW of electricity to the national
grid. One of the country’s largest paper mills is
situated at Ngodwana, close to its timber source.
Northern Cape
The Northern Cape is South Africa’s largest
province, taking up almost a third of the
country’s total land area. However, the
province is sparsely populated with only about
1,2 million people on 372 889 km2 of land.
About 68% of the people speak Afrikaans
while Setswana, isiXhosa and English are
also widely spoken.
The last remaining true San people live in
the Kalahari area, mainly along the Orange
and Vaal rivers. Many fossils and San rock
engravings have been found here, some of
which are displayed at the McGregor Museum
in Kimberley.
The province lies to the south of its most
important asset, the mighty Orange River,
which provides the basis for a healthy
agricultural industry.
The Northern Cape borders the Atlantic
Ocean in the west with Namibia and Botswana
to the north and north-west, respectively. It is
fringed by the Swartberg mountain range on
its southern border.
With two major airports at Kimberley and
Upington, and an excellent road network, the
province’s interior is easily accessible from
South Africa’s major cities, harbours and
airports.
Sutherland hosts the southern hemisphere’s
largest astronomical observatory, the
multinational-sponsored Southern African
Large Telescope.
The Northern Cape is one of two sites
to host the Square Kilometre Array radio-
telescope. Developed by scientists from
17 countries, it will be the largest and most
advanced radio telescope in the world.
Among many other benefits, the province’s
tourism and hospitality industry is profiting
from the project, as scientists and other
interested parties are flooding into the town of
Carnarvon. The province has several national
parks and conservation areas, including
the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, Ai-Ais/
Richtersveld Transfrontier Conservation Park
and Augrabies Falls National Park.

The largest part of the province lies in the
dry Nama-Karoo Biome, which contains a
number of fascinating plants, including the
elephant’s trunk (“halfmens” or half-man)
tree, aloe (“kokerboom” or quiver tree) and a
variety of succulents. The area is well known
for its spectacular annual spring flowers,
which attract thousands of tourists.
Agriculture and industry
The economy of the province’s Karoo region
depends on sheep farming, while the karakul-
pelt industry is one of the most important in
the Gordonia district.
The province has fertile agricultural land,
especially in the Orange River Valley. A variety
of fruit is cultivated at Upington, Kakamas and
Keimoes. The Vaalharts Irrigation Scheme
near Warrenton facilitates the production of
wheat, fruit, peanuts, maize and cotton.
Wine is also produced in the Northern Cape’s
Orange River wine region, which accounts for
25,6% of South Africa’s Colombard vines and
10% of its Chenin Blanc. The Niewoudtville
Rooibos Tea processing initiative centres
on the development and economic
empowerment of smallholder farmers. It
is aimed at unlocking economic potential,
creating sustainable jobs and increasing the
skills base. The installation of pasteurisation
equipment has been completed and tea has
been exported to countries such as Germany,
Spain and Japan.
Mining
Mining contributes 27,6% to the gross regional
domestic product.
Iron-ore mining in the north-eastern corner
of the province has been expanding despite
the global recession, driven largely by China’s
demand for steel.
Sishen is the biggest iron-ore mine in the
country and its owner, Kumba Iron Ore, is
engaging in a new project at Kolomela. New
manganese projects are also underway.
Diamond mining, in contrast, has seen
declining volumes and job losses. Diamond
mining is increasingly moving away from
the older mines to alluvial mining along the
Orange River and its tributaries and in the
Atlantic Ocean.
The province also has copper, asbestos,
fluorspar, semiprecious stones and marble
North West
North West is bordered by Botswana in the
north and fringed by the Kalahari desert
in the west, Gauteng to the east, and the
Free State to the south. It is known as the
“Platinum Province”, owing to its wealth of
this precious metal.
The province has a population of more
than 3,6 million people who mainly speak
Setswana.
Mahikeng is the capital city and well
known for the Mafikeng Siege, which took
place in October 1899 during the Anglo-
Boer/South African War.
Most of the province’s economic activity
is concentrated between Potchefstroom
and Klerksdorp, as well as in Rustenburg
and the eastern region, where more than
83,3% of the province’s economic activity
takes place.
The province has various tourist
attractions including Sun City, the
Pilanesberg National Park, Madikwe
Game Reserve and the De Wildt Cheetah
and Wildlife Trust.
A portion of one of South Africa’s nine
Unesco world heritage sites also falls
within the borders of North West namely
the Taung hominid fossil site, which has
been incorporated into South Africa’s
Cradle of Humankind.
Mining and manufacturing
Mining contributes 23,3% to North West’s
economy, and makes up 22,5% of the South
African mining industry. The Rustenburg
and Brits districts produce 94% of the
country’s platinum, which is more than any
other single area in the world. In addition to
granite, marble, fluorspar and diamonds,
the province also produces a quarter of South
Africa’s gold.
Employment along the Platinum Corridor,
from Pretoria to eastern Botswana, accounts
for over a third of the province’s total
employment.
North West’s manufacturing sector centres
on the municipalities of Brits, Rustenburg,
Potchefstroom, Klerksdorp and Mahikeng,
which together account for more than 50% of
the province’s total manufacturing production.
The industries in Brits concentrate on
manufacturing and construction, while
those in Klerksdorp are geared towards the
mining industry. In the manufacturing arena,
automotive parts, machinery, electronic, audio,
and medical equipment are manufactured
using local materials and resources.

Agriculture
Some of the largest cattle herds in the world
are found at Stellaland near Vryburg, which
explains why this area is often referred to as
the Texas of South Africa. Marico is also cattle
country.
North West is South Africa’s major producer
of white maize.
The areas around Rustenburg are fertile,
mixed-crop farming land, with maize and
sunflowers being the most important crops
Western Cape
Situated on the south-western tip of the
African continent, the Western Cape with
its wide beaches and breathtaking scenery,
complemented by a rich variety of cultures,
historical landmarks, world-class restaurants
and entertainment, is a world-famous tourist
destination.
Cape Town, often referred to as the “Mother
City”, houses Parliament and is South Africa’s
legislative capital. The province has a strong
network of higher education institutions,
including the universities of Cape Town,
Stellenbosch and the Western Cape, and
Visitors to the province can disembark at one
of the province’s two main airports, Cape Town

International or George Airport or at the
sea ports of Cape Town, Mossel Bay and
Saldanha.
Table Mountain, the Cape winelands,
Robben Island and the Kirstenbosch
Botanical Gardens are among the province’s
most popular tourist attractions.
The Western Cape is also known for its
floral diversity. The Cape Floristic Region
World Heritage Site, comprising eight
separate protected areas, covers an area of
more than 553 000 ha, stretching from the
Cape Peninsula to the Eastern Cape.
The Knysna-Tsitsikamma region has the
country’s biggest indigenous forests.
The cold Atlantic Ocean along the West
Coast is a rich fishing area, while the warmer
Indian Ocean skirts the province’s southern
beaches.
Agriculture and fisheries
The Western Cape’s sheltered valleys
between mountains are ideal for the cultivation
of export-grade fruit such as apples, table
grapes, olives, peaches and oranges.
A variety of vegetables is cultivated in the
eastern part of the Western Cape, while the
Swartland and Overberg districts are well-known
as the country’s prime wheat-growing areas.
The agricultural sector is critical to the
Western Cape economy, accounting for 60%
of regional exports.
The Western Cape is also well known for
its wine production. According to a study,
commissioned by the SA Wine Industry
Information & Systems, published in 2015,
some 300 000 people were employed both
directly and indirectly in the wine industry in
2015, including farm labourers, those involved
in packaging, retailing and wine tourism.
The study also concluded that of the R36,1
billion GDP contributed by the wine industry
to the regional economy, about R19,3 billion
eventually would remain in the Western Cape.
Some 75% of all South African fishing takes
place along the Western Cape coastline.
The rich fishing grounds on the west coast
are protected from exploitation by a 200-km
commercial fishing zone and a strict quota
system. Snoek, Cape lobster, abalone,
calamari, octopus, oysters and mussels are
among the delicacies found in these waters.
Other exports are fruit, wine, wool and
ostrich. The high quality of exports, combined
with the relative weakness of the local
currency, makes the products some of the
most affordable high-quality exports in the
world.

Industry
The Saldanha Bay Industrial Development
Zone (SBIDZ) is drawing strong international
interest. The SBIDZ Licencing Company had
signed six lease agreements with international
and South African oil and gas companies.
These include firms specialising in oilfield
services, oil rig operations, logistics operators,
ship repair, engineering and market support.
A feasibility study conducted by the
Department of Trade and Industry found that
Saldanha Bay was strategically located to
serve as a service, maintenance, fabrication
and supply hub for the booming African oil
and gas sector, due to the increasing number
of oil rigs requiring maintenance, and their
traffic flow passing from the west to the east
coast of Africa.
The Western Cape Government has
invested R25 million over five years in setting
up the SBIDZ.
