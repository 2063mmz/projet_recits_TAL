1,2013,aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2019/3/23/italy-joins-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative,en,"Italy joins China’s Belt and Road Initiative Italy is the first G7 country to sign up to the scheme, in a move that has caused upset in Washington and Brussels. Resisting pressure from Washington and Brussels, Italy on Saturday became the first G7 country to join China’s controversial Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Rome, endorsing the global infrastructure-building scheme. Conte and Xi shook hands after 29 separate sections of the MoU were signed by members of both governments. As with previous MoUs, Saturday’s accords were wide-ranging, covering cooperation in the banking sector, a partnership between a Chinese construction company and Italian ports and the export of fruit from the Mediterranean country to China. The agreements also hinted at collaboration between media outlets, as well as in the spheres of science and technology, and promised the return of hundreds of Chinese cultural objects currently in Italy. The MoU is non-binding. But by opening the door to greater Sino-Italian cooperation, it threatens to deepen rifts between Rome and its traditional allies and within Italy’s fragmented coalition government. Luigi di Maio, Italy’s minister for economic development and one of the country’s two deputy prime ministers, told reporters after the signing that Rome’s goal was to “rebalance an imbalance” in Sino-Italian trade. “There is a lot of ‘Made in China’ coming into Italy and too little ‘Made in Italy’ that goes into China,” Di Maio said, adding that Italy now hopes for “a substantial and gradual increase of exports” to “balance out the trade imbalances”. New Silk Road vs debt-trap diplomacy Announced in 2013 as an ambitious plan to build a “belt” of overland corridors and a “road” of maritime shipping lanes spanning Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe, the BRI has evolved to encompass other regions as well as digital infrastructure and even cultural exchanges. Also known as “The New Silk Road”, it promises to strengthen China’s trade and investment links with the rest of the world and cement its position as a major global economic power. BRI projects are financed by Chinese state-owned enterprises that offer participating countries inexpensive loans and credit. Analysts at Morgan Stanley predict China’s investments in BRI countries could reach $1.3 trillion by 2027. The scheme has drawn fire from critics who accuse Beijing of engaging in so-called “debt-trap diplomacy” and potentially masking military endeavours as commercial enterprises. In 2017, Sri Lanka handed Beijing control of a strategic port after it couldn’t pay off its Chinese creditors. The spectre of unsustainable debt burdens has since prompted some countries to delay, scale back and cancel BRI projects. Bold statement to Brussels Italy’s decision to defy the recent backlash and join the BRI comes at a time when the potential to boost Italian exports to China and pump money into crumbling Italian infrastructure is an especially alluring proposition. Italy has an onerous public debt and it fell into recession at the end of last year. “Italy needs investment and resources and China has those to provide,” said Erik Jones, professor of European studies and international political economy at Johns Hopkins University’s Bologna-based School of Advanced International Studies. “Italy also needs to underpin and strengthen its business ties with China [and] this agreement will help there,” he said. Italy is the thirteenth European Union country to sign a memorandum of understanding with China. But it is the first G7 member to do so, throwing the cohesion of the G7 into question. The landmark move is also a bold statement to Brussels, which engaged in an acrimonious budget battle with Rome last year that forced Italy to pare back its spending plans. Brussels and Rome have also butted heads over immigration. “Italy has issues where it is not happy with the EU and the EU is not happy with it, and the only way out of this conundrum is for [Italy] to expand their trade,” Einar Tangen, a political and economic affairs commentator, told Al Jazeera. “Being part of the Belt and Road Initiative would give them a little bit more independence and obviously offer more trade,” he said. Brussels has held a tougher position against the BRI since reports first surfaced of Italy’s plan to join the scheme. The European Commission and the EU’s diplomatic arm released a paper last week that branded China a “systemic rival” and threatened to tighten regulations on Chinese investment in Europe. The paper also included a pledge that EU member states would push for a common approach to potential 5G security risks in response to concerns raised by the US over Chinese tech giant Huawei. Uneasy alliances Some analysts also see Italy’s embrace of the BRI as a symbolic gesture of independence ahead of the European Parliament elections this May. “This agreement is something the government can hold up as an accomplishment,” said Jones. “That is particularly relevant for Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who tends to have to mediate between the coalition partners more than he is able to take credit for new initiatives.” But joining the BRI could further exacerbate tensions between the two main parties in Italy’s coalition government. Di Maio’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement has championed stronger ties with China, while its main coalition partner, the Eurosceptic, far-right League, is seeking to maintain good relations with the US, which is embroiled in an ongoing trade war with Beijing. The US and China are also in an escalating dispute over Huawei, whose products the US claims pose a risk to national security. When reports of Italy’s intentions emerged in early March, the White House National Security Council tweeted: “Endorsing BRI lends legitimacy to China’s predatory approach to investment and will bring no benefits to the Italian people.” On Tuesday, Conte appeared to try and assuage Washington, telling Italy’s parliament that any commercial and economic deals with China “do not remotely put into doubt our Euro-Atlantic alliance”.",2013-2017,15,high_conflict
2,2013,aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2019/4/26/chinas-xi-pledges-to-fight-corruption-at-belt-and-road-summit,en,"China’s Xi pledges to ‘fight corruption’ at Belt and Road summit President Xi Jinping laid out China’s aspirations for its Belt and Road Initiative that spans the globe. China‘s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will focus on transparency and clean governance, President Xi Jinping said at the opening of a summit on his grand plan on Friday, adding that the massive infrastructure and trade plan should result in “high-quality” growth for everyone. Xi’s plan to rebuild the ancient Silk Road to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond has become mired in controversy as some partner nations have bemoaned the high cost of infrastructure projects. China has not said exactly how much money will be needed in total, but some independent estimates suggest it will run into several trillion dollars. Beijing has repeatedly said it is not seeking to trap anyone with debt and only has good intentions, and has been looking to use this week’s three-day summit in Beijing to recalibrate the policy and address those concerns. “Everything should be done in a transparent way and we should have zero tolerance for corruption,” Xi said in a keynote speech. “Building high-quality, sustainable, risk-resistant, reasonably priced, and inclusive infrastructure will help countries to fully utilise their resource endowments.” Unlike the first summit in 2017, where Xi said Chinese banks would lend 380 billion yuan ($56.43bn) to support Belt and Road cooperation, he did not give a figure for new financing support. But Xi is expected to give another speech on Saturday. ‘Debt trap diplomacy’ Al Jazeera’s Katrina Yu, reporting from Beijing, said President Xi used most of his half-hour speech trying to allay concerns about the BRI. “One of the main criticisms is that this really is a big plan, which basically is a form of debt trap diplomacy – what happens is some of these countries … are saddled with millions, potentially billions of dollars worth of debt that they’re unable to pay back,” Katrina said. “They default on these loans, which leaves them quite vulnerable to Chinese political influence,” she added. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde echoed those concerns. “History has taught us that, if not managed carefully, infrastructure investments can lead to a problematic increase in debt,” Lagarde said in remarks prepared for delivery at the conference. “I have said before that, to be fully successful, the Belt and Road should only go where it is needed. I would add today that it should only go where it is sustainable, in all aspects.” Sri Lanka sold China a 70 percent stake in a major port – Hambantota – in 2017 despite security concerns and demonstrations. Sri Lankan officials said the deal was the only way the country could repay debt – much of it owed to China. Malaysia halted a BRI rail project last year, restarting after it renegotiated to reduce the cost of construction by a third and increase the level of local involvement. “I am fully in support of the Belt and Road Initiative,” Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said at the forum. “I am sure my country, Malaysia, will benefit from the project.” ‘Social uplift’ Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan said his country’s electricity supplies had increased “massively” with the implementation of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). China has pledged more than $60bn to Pakistan in loans and investments for roads, ports, power plants and industrial parks making the country one of the largest BRI recipients. Khan said Pakistan was looking forward to the project moving into its next phase focusing on “social uplift”, poverty alleviation, agriculture and industry, including the opening of special economic zones. “In a world of uncertainty”, Khan said, the initiative offered “a model of collaboration, partnership, connectivity and shared prosperity”. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the environment could also benefit. The scale of planned Belt and Road investments “offers a meaningful opportunity to contribute to the creation of a more equitable, prosperous world for all, and to reversing the negative impact of climate change”, Guterres said. Xi launched the BRI in 2013, and according to financial markets data company Refinitiv, the total value of projects in the scheme stands at $3.67 trillion, spanning countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, Oceania and South America. Chinese promises The BRI will also bring development opportunities for China as it further opens its markets to the world, Xi said. “In accordance with the need for further opening up, [we’ll] improve laws and regulations, regulate government behaviour at all levels in administrative licensing, market supervision and other areas, and clean up and abolish unreasonable regulations, subsidies and practices that impede fair competition and distort the market,” he said. Xi promised to significantly shorten the negative list that restricts foreign investments, and allow foreign companies to take a majority stake or set up wholly-owned companies in more sectors. Tariffs will be lower and non-tariff barriers will be eliminated, Xi added. China also aims to import more services and goods, and is willing to import competitive agricultural products and services to achieve trade balance “and inclusive growth for the world economy”, Xi said. But despite the promises, there are other criticisms over how some of these deals are actually implemented, Al Jazeera’s Katrina said. “There is very little rule of law involved … very opaque deals resulting in corruption, in environmental damage,” she said. Although the summit brought together 37 heads of state, the United States had no significant representation, nor did most major European countries, Katrina noted. “They remain deeply suspicious and sceptical of this plan being anything more than Beijing trying to attain more political influence worldwide,” she said. Russian President Vladimir Putin said BRI “will provide a harmonious and sustainable economic development, economic growth, throughout the Eurasian space”. Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister of Italy, which recently became the first G7 country to sign on to the initiative, is also attending the summit.",2013-2017,18,high_conflict
3,2013,aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2019/4/27/who-will-benefit-from-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative,en,"Who will benefit from China’s Belt and Road Initiative? As President Xi allays debt concerns, analysts say the project’s success requires foresight and honesty from all sides. Ramped-up efforts to rebrand China’s mammoth Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) were in full swing this week as the country hosted a giant forum and President Xi Jinping touted the benefits of multinational cooperation and sustainable infrastructure while pointing to efforts to address concerns. The size and breadth of The Second Belt and Road Forum For International Cooperation in Beijing, which covered everything from environmental policy to corruption and China’s lending practices, underscored the effort China is putting on recreating the image of the BRI. Beyond the hundreds of meetings and the agreements signed, photo-ops with three dozen heads of state, and promises of both private and public investment into infrastructure and trade, Xi took pains to underscore China’s good intentions and commitment to transparency and building “high-quality, sustainable, risk-resistant, reasonably priced, and inclusive infrastructure”, as he said during his keynote speech on the opening day of the three-day forum. He worked hard to assuage increasingly loud fears that the BRI is a vehicle for China to extend its influence and make some money in the process, repeating this message during a leaders roundtable and a rare meeting with journalists on Saturday afternoon. Xi said a total of $64bn worth of agreements had been signed during the forum, but he gave no details or acknowledged who signed them. The initiative – which he launched in 2013 – is “in sync with the times and widely supported”, he said. “It looks like this is a sort of readjustment of the original One Belt One Road, now the BRI,” said Bruno S Sergi, an instructor on the economics of emerging markets and the political economy of Russia and China at Harvard University and an associate at the Harvard Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies. “Zero corruption, green, multilateral, quality, sustainability are the new glossary terms of the Chinese president,” said Sergi. “No doubt these new terms point in the right direction.” The forum shed little light into whether all these new terms translate into more than speeches and a large marketing effort. Debt trap concerns At six years old, it is still early days for a plan that is very long term, said Sergi. To date, about $90bn have been invested in multiple BRI-related projects, but several hundred billion more have been loosely committed and it will be years before all that capital is invested, even though China’s two policy banks have more than $300bn in outstanding financing. The plan has certainly attracted attention and 125 countries have signed up. Italy joined, at the end of March, the first major European economy to do so. But the backlash over the past couple of years has grown. Some countries worry that China is forcing them into a debt trap, or that the plan is another form of colonialism. Malaysia cancelled some BRI projects linked to widespread corruption. Turkey skipped the forum citing fears of debt-trap diplomacy. In Montenegro, BRI financing has drastically expanded national debt. Xi took pains to address these concerns at the forum by committing to ensuring both environmental and financial sustainability in projects and investments. Still, it remains hard to pin down exactly what the BRI is and what benefits it will generate, not because there aren’t any but because the initiative is so big that it defies easy definition. At the forum, Xi linked the BRI to connectivity and cooperation, to the “challenges and risks confronting mankind”, global economic growth, international trade and investment, governance, multilateralism, green development and innovation. He committed to inviting 10,000 representatives of “political parties, think-tanks and non-governmental organisations”, expand market access, enhance intellectual property protection, boost imports, engage in macro-economic policy coordination, and greater opening up. Long-term vision The BRI may have started out as ostensibly an investing and lending programme for infrastructure but it has evolved into a catch-all for virtually everything China does abroad, blending the lines between economics, politics and military into one giant programme, said Joshua Eisenman, an assistant professor at the Lyndon B Johnson School of Public Affairs at The University of Texas at Austin, and a China expert who has followed the BRI since its inception “Over time BRI has evolved into a moniker for everything,” Eisenman said. “When people ask ‘will the BRI work?’ What they are essentially asking is ‘will Xi Jinping’s foreign policy work?'” Nevertheless, China is filling a funding gap that exists for many countries, particularly emerging economies. It is a gap that, at least for the time being, no other large economy seems to be willing to fill and in so doing, is lending huge amounts to countries that may not necessarily be able to afford to maintain those loans. “When the option is to take money or don’t take money, people will take the money every time,” said Eisenman. Still, for all its pros and cons the BRI may be a vehicle for a new type of national entrepreneurship, said Sergi. For the effort to be effective the BRI will require “equal efficiency and foresight on the part of the many countries and actors interested in the new Silk Road”. “Only a commonly felt new approach that moves things in the proper direction could make the BRI a gigantic win-win solution towards better infrastructure, growth and progress and to avoid hegemonic or predatory forms, on the one hand, and prevent indebtedness in some countries as well,” Sergi said. He suggested the jury is still out on the ultimate effect of the BRI and will be out for a long time to come. “It looks like the BRI is becoming a ‘waiting for Godot vision’. While a powerful long-term vision, it requires that all actors from the Chinese side and all other countries act with care and commitment to honesty and discernment.”",2013-2017,12,high_conflict

Yangon, Myanmar – Chinese President Xi Jinping arrives in Myanmar on Friday on his first trip to the country since 2009 and is expected to step up investment in the Southeast Asian nation including in the conflict-racked state of Rakhine, a key link in China‘s Belt and Road initiative. Myanmar’s Deputy Minister of Commerce Aung Htoo told reporters before the visit that Xi would sign agreements related to the Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone and $1.3bn port in Rakhine, where a brutal military crackdown in 2017 led hundreds of thousands of Rohingya to flee over the border to Bangladesh. Recommended Stories list of 3 items- list 1 of 3Myanmar’s women trafficked to China at risk of sexual violence - list 2 of 3ICJ to rule on emergency measures in Myanmar genocide case - list 3 of 3World Bank gives China billions in loans despite US objections “Xi has visited almost all ASEAN countries since assuming power in 2013, but Myanmar had been left out until now,” Yun Sun, director of the China programme at the Stimson Center, said in an email to Al Jazeera. During his two-day visit, Xi is scheduled to meet President Win Myint, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, and Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing in the capital Naypyidaw. When the National League of Democracy under Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi swept into power in 2015, there was an expectation around the world that it would mark a new age of human rights and democracy in a country that had spent decades under military rule. But despite the intense criticism by many Western countries on its handling of the Rohingya crisis, China has been able to rebuild its influence with its southern neighbour, analysts said. Sun said the fallout over the Rohingya crisis and Myanmar’s current isolation in the international community, had given China an opportunity to win Myanmar over through a “gesture of support”. “The trip would not happen without the Chinese side being certain about the direction of the bilateral relations going in a positive direction. In other words, the Chinese are confident that China has regained its damaged influence and repaired its tarnished image in the country,” Sun said. ‘Bypassing Strait of Malacca’ In an article published in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar a day before his arrival, Xi expressed confidence that the projects would progress, specifically mentioning the Kyaukphyu project, as well as the China-Myanmar Border Economic Cooperation Zone and New Yangon City developments. China and Myanmar “need to deepen results-oriented Belt and Road cooperation and move from a conceptual station to concrete planning and implementation,” he wrote. The Kyaukphyu port would give China direct access to the Indian Ocean, allowing it to bypass the Strait of Malacca. Around 80 percent of China’s oil imports pass through the narrow strait between Malaysia and Indonesia, leaving it vulnerable to blockades or unrest over the disputed South China Sea. The port, coupled with a planned railway from Kyaukphyu to China’s Yunnan province would not only bypass the strait but also be more direct. Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations said Myanmar was “probably moving closer to China” but emphasised that the two countries had been “very close” for years. “China has been the dominant strategic actor in Myanmar for several decades. But Xi is seeking to keep it that way, with a state visit,” he said in an email to Al Jazeera. Different from Cambodia Kurlantzick also said the visit was “consistent with China’s desire to remain the pre-eminent external power in Myanmar” and blunt the influence of Japan, which is pushing its own infrastructure projects. Despite the two countries’ close relationship, Myanmar has maintained a certain caution about Chinese development. “I don’t think they are going to accept everything and anything China proposes,” Sun said. “On that, Burma is categorically different from Cambodia.” Where Cambodia is effectively a one-party state, Myanmar is at least semi-democratic, and an election is due later this year. People have shown they are willing to question development. The China-backed Myitsone Dam in Kachin State, for example, was delayed indefinitely in 2011 after mass protests from local residents and attacks from the Kachin Independence Army. Xi himself might have an eye on the election too. The visit “may provide Xi and his entourage a chance to assess the various Myanmar politicians who may be contesting for the leadership in the next national elections,” Kurlantzick said. Local media has reported that Xi plans to meet representatives of minor parties and in the run-up to the visit, Chinese officials met the leaders of various ethnic armed groups in Myanmar which have been fighting the central government for decades. ‘Fiefdoms’ China’s special envoy for Asian affairs Sun Guoxiang met close Chinese allies like the National Democratic Alliance Army and officials from Wa State. Both groups have carved out fully autonomous fiefdoms within Myanmar’s borders and have close ties with China. The government of Wa State welcomed Xi’s visit in a statement, expressing “delight” and hope that the two countries would “live in harmony”. Guoxiang also met the Arakan Army (AA), an ethnic armed group that has been a significant thorn in the Myanmar government’s side, as it tries to carve out a territory of its own in Rakhine – the same state where the Kyaukphyu port is located. While the AA has complained that the Myanmar government pursues development projects without input from the locals, the group does not oppose Chinese investment. China acts as an intermediary between the AA and the military, a mutually beneficial relationship that gives the rebel group a communication channel and makes China an essential part of the peace process. The Myanmar government is also eager to repair the image of Rakhine after years of violence. “Having a major project in Rakhine would be a boon to the Myanmar government’s claims of boosting stability and development in Rakhine State,” Kurlantzick said but added that focusing on development before accountability for human rights violations was “troubling” to some. Amnesty International is among those troubled, writing in a press release that China must stop shielding Myanmar’s generals from international accountability for human rights violations against the Rohingya. “With major economic and infrastructure agreements expected to be signed during President Xi’s visit, the absolute lack of transparency over such agreements is deeply disturbing,” said Amnesty’s Regional Director, Nicholas Bequelin, in the statement, adding that investment can only help improve human rights if it benefits the people on the ground. While the AA may welcome Chinese development, many Rakhine people feel differently. “We hold the motto that no development without genuine peace,” said Ting Oo, General Secretary of the All Arakan Students’ & Youths’ Congress. “Right now, most of the development projects across Myanmar are planned and implemented by only a handful of people in power.” Ting Oo said it made no difference whether the development was Chinese or Western, as the current system for approving projects lacked transparency, did not include local people and was poorly regulated. “Without such minimum requirements, we see no points in supporting a development project, however great the incentives are,” he said.",2013-2017,15,high_conflict
5,2013,aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2020/7/16/new-china-deals-signal-belt-and-road-revival-in-pakistan,en,"New China deals signal Belt and Road revival in Pakistan China and Pakistan signed projects worth $11bn, including a $3.9bn hydroelectric dam and a $7.2bn railway upgrade. China’s Belt and Road program has found new life in Pakistan with $11 billion worth of projects signed in the last month, driven by a former lieutenant general who has reinvigorated the infrastructure plan that’s been languishing since Prime Minister Imran Khan took office two years ago. The nations signed deals on June 25 and July 6 for two hydro-power generation projects costing $3.9 billion in the disputed Kashmir region, and another to revamp the South Asian nation’s colonial-era railways for $7.2 billion — the most expensive Chinese project yet in Pakistan. Khan’s government appointed Asim Saleem Bajwa last year to run the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority, which oversees more than $70 billion in projects from power plants to highways. He also joined Khan’s cabinet in late April, becoming one of more than a dozen former and current military officials in prominent government roles as the army expands its influence in the country. The Chinese financing has helped rid Pakistan of an electricity deficit that left exporters unable to meet orders and major cities without electricity for much of the day. Still, the implementation of some investments appeared to stall since Khan came to power, with no new projects announced in 2018 and very few in 2019. Since Chinese President Xi Jinping launched the initiative in 2013, the World Bank estimates about $575 billion worth of energy plants, railways, roads, ports and other projects have been built or are in the works across the globe. Its progress has slowed recently, dogged by accusations that China is luring poor countries into debt traps for its own political and strategic gain. “The reality is that much of CPEC, like the Belt and Road more broadly, has been paralyzed,” said Jonathan Hillman, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, referring to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Pakistan “is a flagship for China’s Belt and Road, so the need to show progress is even more important.” In a tweet last month, Bajwa said some detractors had given the “false impression” that CPEC had been slowed. Not only has the pace of work on projects picked up recently, but a great deal of ground work has been done to launch phase two of the project that also includes special economic zones to lure Chinese manufacturers, agriculture, science, technology and tourism, he wrote. “The prime minister pushed very hard on this,” said Abdul Razak Dawood, Khan’s adviser on commerce and investments said by phone. “We feel that we have to get more and more hydro in our energy mix.” A spokesman in Bajwa’s office said he was not immediately available to comment. Little Progress Pakistan’s army is already responsible for securing every single Beijing-funded project scattered across the country, from the mountains near the Chinese border to the desert in Gwadar where the Chinese operate a port. Its role has become even more important following terrorist attacks on three Chinese-related projects in the past year. “There is no doubt that PM Khan’s arrival slowed the pace of CPEC projects,” said Mosharraf Zaidi, a senior fellow at Islamabad-based think tank, Tabadlab, and a former principal advisor to the foreign ministry. “The renewed energy and approval we are now seeing is almost entirely likely due to the chairperson having settled in, and being added to Prime Minister Khan’s cabinet.” Indeed there’s deepening concerns over Islamabad’s ability to service its debts under the program. The Center for Global Development has listed Pakistan among eight nations that face potential debt-sustainability problems because of the initiative. The country must repay China more than double the amount it owes the International Monetary Fund over the next three years, according to an IMF report last year. For its part, Beijing says its projects in Pakistan had made major progress over the last six years. “China firmly supports the development of CPEC and stands ready to work with Pakistan,” China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular press briefing in Beijing on July 7, adding that future cooperation will focus on social development, livelihood, industry and agriculture in addition to infrastructure construction. Regional Conflict The hydro projects are both based in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, a region at the heart of tensions with arch-rival India. The neighbors have fought three wars — two over Kashmir — and last year a terrorist attack in the Indian-controlled portion led to the most serious military escalation in more than a decade. The $2.4 billion Kohala hydro power project is being built on the Jhelum River in Muzaffarabad, just 100 kilometers (62 miles) from where both armies exchange gunfire. The Azad Pattan project — which will cost $1.5 billion — is being built on the same river. “China and Pakistan may also be antagonizing India,” said Hillman. Both hydro projects are in Kashmir, and the railway is part of a much longer, and still far fetched plan to connect China and Pakistan by rail, also passing through occupied territory, said Hillman. Several countries have run into trouble with Belt and Road projects or had to rework plans after complaints over corruption, padded contracts, heavy debt loads, environmental damage and a reliance on imported Chinese labor over local hires. Pakistan renegotiated the project to revamp its British-era legacy railway system. It was initially estimated to cost $8.2 billion but that was reduced to $6.2 billion, according to the nation’s railways minister. The final amount is higher than the revised cost but still $1 billion less that initial estimate. All three new projects have been under discussion for some time before this month’s announcement. “Though these are difficult projects to get across the line compared to low hanging fruits like coal and LNG power projects that were announced at the start of the Chinese financing projects,” said Samiullah Tariq, head of research at Pakistan Kuwait Investment Company, “China is a critical ally for Pakistan to continue growing.”",2013-2017,11,high_conflict

Relations between the United States and China are tense, once again, with experts saying that the administration of US President Donald Trump “doesn’t quite know how to deal with China”. The latest flare-up took place when Beijing, on October 9, expanded its restrictions on the export of rare-earth metals, increasing the number of elements on the list.

In a first, it also required countries to have a licence to export rare-earth magnets and certain semiconductor materials that contain even trace amounts of minerals sourced from China or produced using Chinese technology. China’s actions on rare-earths also came after the US expanded its Entity List, a trade restriction list that consists of certain foreign persons, entities or government, further limiting China’s access to the most advanced semiconductor chips, and added levies on China-linked ships both to boost the US shipbuilding industry and loosen China’s hold on the global shipping trade. China retaliated by applying its own charges on US-owned, operated, built or flagged vessels. “For the US, its actions on chip exports and shipping industry fees were not related to the trade deal with China,” said Vina Nadjibulla, vice president for research and strategy at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada. Since then, the two countries have also been in an “information war”, said Nadjibulla, each blaming the other for holding the world hostage with its policies. But beyond the rhetoric, the world is seeing China really up its game. “For the first time, China is doing this extra-terrestrial action that applies to other countries as well [with its amped up export restrictions on rare-earths]. They are prepared to match every US escalation, and have the US back down,” Nadjibulla said. “This is a very different kind of a trade war than we were experiencing even three months ago.” This was a “power play” by China in the run-up to a planned meeting later this month between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea because “China has decided that the leverage is on their side,” said Dexter Tiff Roberts, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council Global China Hub, pointing out that after some initial noise with Trump saying there was no reason to meet Xi any longer, the meeting is back on. “If you look at the approach of the Trump administration right now, they are all over the place,” said Roberts. Roberts was referring not only to the multiple tariff threats that the US has issued both on China and on specific industries and the carve-outs that were soon announced on those, but also in its statements on the Trump-Xi meeting, with Trump saying it was not happening, only to reverse that two days later. “The Trump administration doesn’t quite know how to deal with China,” said Roberts. “They don’t understand that China is willing to accept a lot of pain,” and will not be easily cowed by US threats. Beijing, on the other hand, has realised that Trump is determined to get his big deal with China and wants his state visit to seal that, maybe because “he feels that is important to his credentials as a big deal maker,” added Roberts, but that he cannot get there without giving more to China. “China saw that they could push harder in the lead-up to the meeting.” Wei Liang, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies who specialises in international trade and Chinese economic foreign policy, agrees. “Trump has a track record of TACO,” she said, referring to a term coined by a Financial Times columnist in May, which stands for “Trump always chickens out” in reference to his announcing tariffs and then carving out exemptions and pushing out implementation dates. “He cares more than any other US president [about] stock market reactions, so definitely will be more flexible to making concessions. This is the inconsistency that has been captured by his negotiation partners,” Liang said. China’s defiant stance also comes at a time of its own political concerns, Liang added. While the domestic economy is “a black box” with no reliable data available on growth, employment and other criteria, the consensus among China experts is that the country has been hit by the tariffs, economic growth has slowed, and unemployment has ramped up. As China started its four-day fourth plenary session on Monday where it plans to approve the draft of its next five-year national economic and social development plan, Xi can use the moment to tell his domestic audience that the country’s problems are stemming from Trump’s policies and the whole world is suffering because of those tariffs and it’s not related to Chinese policies, Liang said. A possible decoupling All of this also signals that Beijing seems to be prepared to “decouple” from the US more than ever, a significant change in mentality, as, in the past, the standard response to the idea was that it would be a “lose-lose” situation for both countries, Liang told Al Jazeera. But in the last few years, China has diversified its exports to other countries, especially those in its Belt and Road Initiative, the ambitious infrastructure project that it launched in 2013 to link East Asia through Europe and has since expanded to Africa, Oceania and Latin America. Even when it comes to things that it needs from the US – soya beans, aeroplanes and high-tech chip equipment – it can find other suppliers or has learned to work around that need, as is the case for the chip equipment, Liang pointed out. In the meantime, especially in the years since the US-China trade war started under Trump as president in his first term, China has brought in a set of national security laws – including its version of the US Entity List, through which it is setting limits on those exports, Nadjibulla said. “Everybody should have been preparing the way the Chinese have been preparing. We breathed a sigh of relief when there was a change in government [in the US after the first Trump administration], but China kept preparing,” she said. “This should be a wake-up call for all countries to find other sources for its needs. Everyone should be redoubling their efforts to diversify, because we have now seen the Chinese playbook.”",2013-2017,7,high_conflict
7,2013,aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/4/25/can-china-replace-the-us-in-the-middle-east,en,"Can China replace the US in the Middle East? As the Saudi-Iran deal shows, Beijing’s clout in the region is growing. But it can’t substitute US security presence — and might not want to. On April 6, the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia and Iran met for the first time in seven years. A month earlier, top national security officials of the two countries had stunned the world, re-establishing diplomatic relations after years of hostility that had raised tensions across their shared neighbourhood. But the meetings that led to the dramatic breakthrough were not held in the Middle East. They were hosted and mediated by China, after years of unsuccessful attempts by Oman and Iraq. In the West, China’s central role in keeping Russia’s economy afloat despite sanctions, and Beijing’s unwillingness to even question Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine have drawn sharp criticism. Yet experts say its newfound success as a peacemaker in the Middle East signals a shift for China, which has traditionally hesitated from involving itself too deeply in efforts to resolve global conflicts. And it seems to be dreaming big. In February, shortly before the Iran-Saudi talks concluded, Beijing launched its Global Security Initiative, with the aim of “peacefully resolving differences and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation”. Then last week, China’s new foreign minister, Qin Gang, said Beijing was ready to mediate peace talks between Israel and Palestine. The Saudi-Iran deal could serve as China’s “launchpad to future initiatives”, said Julia Gurol-Haller, an associate fellow at the Arnold-Bergstraesser-Institut Freiburg in Germany. It is a declaration that China is ready to play a bigger role than it previously has in mediating conflicts, she said. All of this comes at a time when the influence of the United States — traditionally the biggest power broker in the Middle East — has waned, according to many analysts. The US decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal, its blow-hot-blow-cold relationship with Saudi Arabia, and its long occupation and chaotic withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan have hurt its credibility. Domestic politics have also kept the US distracted, as has a growing wariness among the American public about the country’s decades-long role as a global policeman. But can China offer the Middle East everything that the US — for all of its failings — has over the years? The short answer: Despite its fast-rising clout, China still does not have the ability to replace the US in the Middle East, where Washington has dozens of military bases and allies it has committed to defending. But Beijing might not want to take on that responsibility yet in any case, experts say. For now, China can benefit from expanded diplomatic and economic influence while letting the US continue leading on the region’s security concerns. Advantage China Well before the Saudi Arabia-Iran deal, China had already established itself as a vital partner to countries in the Middle East. China is the top trading partner of Saudi Arabia and Iran and is the biggest buyer of oil from the two nations. In recent years, it has further cemented these relationships, signing a 25-year cooperation deal with Iran in 2021 and a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement with Saudi Arabia in 2022. But that goodwill extends beyond Saudi Arabia and Iran, thanks in no small part to the massive Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) launched in 2013, with the aim of connecting Asia, Europe and Africa through a China-backed network of ports, railways, highways and other infrastructure projects. China invested more than $273bn in the region between 2005 and 2022. It is the largest investor in the Middle East. It also buys oil from Iraq, gas from Qatar, and exports weapons to Algeria, Morocco, Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. It is helping Egypt build its new capital outside Cairo, and has constructed the metro rail network in Mecca. In December 2022, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Saudi Arabia for three days, during which he also held Beijing’s first-ever summits with the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described the visit as marking “a new historical era” in ties between China and his country. Meanwhile, China’s rapid advances in cutting-edge tech in recent years mean that Beijing can offer access to services like 5G connectivity through companies like Huawei. All of this gives China automatic clout in the region, said Trita Parsi, the co-founder and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a Washington-based think tank. This influence has enabled Beijing to succeed with Saudi Arabia and Iran where past negotiators had failed, he said. Countries across the region want to stay in China’s good graces for economic reasons. Even better, Beijing is viewed as an ideologically neutral trading partner, which has long maintained a policy of non-interference in the domestic issues of Middle Eastern countries, from politics to human rights, making it a less controversial mediator than countries like the US. It is also not associated with a particular cause like the US’s close relationship with Israel, and has no history of punitive action — whether through military action or sanctions — in the region. “At the end of the day, a key reason as to why many of these countries have a benign view of China is not just because China doesn’t interfere in their affairs, it’s because they have not seen China conduct itself in a way that would be threatening to them, or that has the potential of being threatening,” Parsi told Al Jazeera. The US does not enjoy that reputation, even among some of its traditional partners — and the sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine have added to the unease in the region’s capitals, he suggested. “With the United States, they see [it] has the ability to cut Russia off of the international financial system within five days. That is an immensely powerful tool, and the United States has not conducted itself particularly responsibly for the last 20 years,” Parsi said. “So it’s a very powerful tool in the hands of an at-times reckless player. That’s threatening.” A different kind of power At the same time that it is setting itself up as a potential alternative to the US in the Middle East, Beijing is not really trying to usurp the position Washington has long held, said Fan Hongda, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University. China’s power primarily lies in its economic influence and projects like the BRI – and this is something it would be happy to maintain for now in the region, he said. “China never intended to control the Middle East,” Fan told Al Jazeera. “I don’t think Beijing has any plans to displace the US in the Middle East. Because many actions of the United States in the Middle East are not what China likes. In short, China has its own way of cooperating with Middle Eastern countries.” China and the US have found themselves on opposite ends of conflicts like the Syrian civil war. Beijing has used its veto at the United Nations Security Council to keep Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad in power. But it has otherwise kept a much lower profile on major conflicts than Washington, DC, and it does not have the same historic track record of carrying out regime change and helping to topple democratically elected leaders. The US has more than three dozen military bases in the Middle East. To be sure, despite the image it likes to promote of itself as a benign power compared with the US, China has in recent years moved to dramatically upgrade and expand its military capabilities, which it often showcases in its own neighbourhood. In 2017, the People’s Liberation Army built its first overseas military base in Djibouti, near the Strait of Hormuz. Four years later, the Wall Street Journal reported that China was possibly building a naval base in the United Arab Emirates, a project that was grounded after the US intervened with UAE authorities. Some China watchers say Beijing follows a policy of “first civilian, then military” as it builds up infrastructure like ports, railways, and airports, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Still, Zakiyeh Yazdanshenas, director of the China-Middle East Project at Tehran’s Center for Middle East Strategic Studies, said China’s track record so far showed little appetite for US-style involvement in the region. “Beijing has neither the ability nor the desire to have a military presence like that of the US in the region, but it does try to expand its influence in the Middle East and especially in the Persian Gulf,” she told Al Jazeera. Yazdanshenas described China’s aims as threefold: “Ensuring the security of the free flow of energy while imposing the lowest cost on China and at the same time raising its prestige as a responsible international player.” Limits to influence But while this can get China quite far, its reluctance to take on the role of “policeman” or security provider could limit its negotiating toolkit in the long run, said Mark Fitzpatrick, an associate fellow for strategy, technology and arms control at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. It also remains to be seen whether China can enforce deals it has mediated with economic guarantees alone, or if it can replicate its recent success beyond Iran and Saudi Arabia – both of which are deeply tied to China through energy sales. “One issue is whether the Saudi-Iran rapprochement will hold and whether China will be able to enforce it. I think a lot of people have had some doubts about how stable it will be,” Fitzpatrick told Al Jazeera. “There could be something that happens that unravels it again, and China’s economic leverage might not be enough to really enforce it. That’s not saying it’s going to unravel, but it may be that all aspects of the deal may not play out as it hoped.” For now, China has to walk down a “very long and bumpy” road to peace and avoid becoming embroiled in protracted conflicts, like the US has done many times, Gurol-Haller at the Arnold-Bergstraesser-Institut Freiburg said. “It’s not clear how China will accompany Iran and Saudi Arabia in walking down the road,” she told Al Jazeera. “The joint statement that was issued after this deal was made does not clarify how the signing parties or China will respond to violation. “So what happens if Iran breaks its part of the deal? Or what happens if Saudi Arabia does not comply with what it had promised? It’s really not clear how China can react to that and what are the carrots and what are the sticks.” What is clear, Gurol-Haller said, is that for China in the Middle East, the hard work starts now.",2013-2017,26,high_conflict
8,2013,aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/3/20/muslim-countries-urged-to-press-china-end-crackdown-of-uighurs,en,"Muslim countries urged to press China end crackdown of Uighurs Group of Uighur Muslim scholars accuses Beijing of engaging in systematic human rights violations of ethnic compatriots. Doha, Qatar – A group of visiting Uighur Muslim scholars originally from China’s Xinjiang province has urged Muslim-majority countries to press China to end its “cultural war” against their ethnic compatriots. According to a United Nations panel, more than one million Uighurs and other Muslims are held in what rights groups and activists call mass detention centres in the remote western region – a charge denied by Beijing. During a visit to Qatar’s capital, Doha, leaders from the Turkey-based Society of the Muslim Scholars of East Turkistan (SMSET) accused Beijing of engaging in systematic human rights violations of Uighurs in a bid to erase their cultural and religious heritage. “The Chinese government is waging a cultural war against our people by trying to force us to abandon our Muslim faith and our heritage to become atheists and communists like the majority Chinese society,” the SMSET’s Abdel Khaleq Uighur said on Tuesday. In January, China passed a new law that sought to “Sinicise” Islam within the next five years, the latest move by Beijing to rewrite how the religion is practised. Sinification is a process of melting non-Chinese communities into the majority Han Chinese culture. China conquered East Turkistan in 1949 and renamed it Xinjiang province which means the new territories in Chinese. No major Muslim country has publicly condemned China for the alleged mass incarceration of Uighurs and other ethnic Muslim minorities except Turkey, which has called on China to shut the camps. Beijing calls the camps “reeducation centres”. Ancient Silk Road The Uighurs, whose homeland is in the heart of the ancient Silk Road, say Beijing sees their presence as an obstacle to its economic development and westward expansion through its flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Launched in 2013, the massive investment drive aims to finance and build infrastructure in some 80 countries around the world, including in the Middle East and parts of Eurasia. “With high-speed rail and other upgraded land transport developments, China strives to promote land and maritime trade simultaneously between China and the Middle East,” Wang Jian, a professor of history and international political economy at Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, said in a paper published in 2017. Mohamad Mahmoud, of the SMET, argued that China’s promises of vast wealth and economic development from its BRI projects have prevented Muslim-majority countries from addressing the crackdown on Uighurs. “I hope that Muslim countries can overcome their fears of China and address its gross human rights abuses against our community,” he said. Uighurs speak a Turkic language distinct from the country’s overwhelming Han majority. According to a 2018 Amnesty report, open or even private displays of religious and cultural affiliation, including growing a beard, wearing a veil or headscarf, regular prayer, fasting or avoidance of alcohol, or possessing books or articles about Islam or Uighur culture can be considered “extremist” under the regulation. Last week, the Chinese government published a lengthy policy paper outlining and defending its policy against the Uighurs as “deradicalisation” measures. The paper admitted the arrest of 13,000 Muslim Uighurs since 2014. Responding to government claims of “terrorism and radicalism” in the region, Mahmoud said the Chinese government claims are not true. Mahmoud said his countrymen inside East Turkistan have no political or military organisation to seek independence or separation from China. “despite that the Chinese government accuse our people of terrorism and mass arrest them.” “The only terrorism in the region comes from the Chinese government itself,” added Mahmoud.

Cambodia has denied a report that it has reached a secret agreement to allow China to station its armed forces at a coastal naval base. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Cambodia had agreed to allow China exclusive access to part of Cambodia’s Ream Naval Base on the Gulf of Thailand, citing officials from the United States and allied nations who were familiar with the matter. Such an arrangement would enhance China’s ability to assert its territorial claims and economic interests in the contested South China Sea, but challenge other Southeast Asian nations and US allies. Cambodia’s Prime Minister, Hun Sen, rubbished the report. “This is the worst-ever made up news against Cambodia,” Hun Sen told the pro-government website Fresh News on Monday. “No such thing could happen because hosting foreign military bases is against the Cambodian constitution,” he said. Cambodian defence ministry spokesman Chhum Socheat told Reuters the report was “made up and baseless”. China is Hun Sen’s strongest regional ally and has poured billions of dollars in development assistance and loans into Cambodia through its Belt and Road Initiative, as well as other bilateral initiatives. The BRI was unveiled by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, and aims to develop a sprawling network of land and sea links with Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa. Chinese influence A flood of Chinese commercial ventures, including casinos and special economic zones, have sprung up in Cambodia in recent years. The US Defense Department suggested earlier this month that China might be attempting to gain a military foothold in Cambodia in a letter to the country’s government asking why it had turned down an offer to repair a naval base. The State Department urged Cambodia in a statement to reject such an arrangement, saying the nation had a “constitutional commitment to its people to pursue an independent foreign policy”. “We are concerned that any steps by the Cambodian government to invite a foreign military presence in Cambodia would threaten the coherence and centrality of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in coordinating regional developments, and disturb peace and stability in Southeast Asia,” the statement said. Cambodia denied reports last November that Beijing had been lobbying the Southeast Asian country since 2017 for a naval base that could host frigates, destroyers and other vessels of China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy.",2013-2017,13,high_conflict

Some G20 creditor countries are reluctant to broaden and extend another year of coronavirus debt service relief to the world’s poorest countries, so a six-month compromise may emerge this week, World Bank President David Malpass said on Monday. Malpass, speaking to reporters as the World Bank’s and International Monetary Fund’s virtual annual meetings get under way, said G20 debt working groups have not reached agreement on the two institutions’ push for a year-long extension of the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI).

Finance ministers and central bank governors from the G20 major economies are scheduled to meet by videoconference on Wednesday. In May, they launched an initiative to allow poor countries to suspend payments on official bilateral debt owed to G20 creditor countries until the end of 2020, which Malpass said has freed up $5bn to bolster coronavirus responses so far. Malpass and IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva have been warning that far more debt relief is needed for low- and middle-income countries, including principal reduction, to avoid a “lost decade” as the pandemic destroys economic activity. Malpass said the two institutions would propose a joint action plan to reduce the debt stock for poor countries with unsustainable debts. But he said debtor nations needed to more strongly demand debt relief for more progress to be made. “Leaders of the debtor nations have been deferential to the creditors,” Malpass said. “It’s been very important that leaders of poorest nations speak up and speak out about the need for a lighter debt burden from the creditor nations. That dialogue hasn’t been as robust yet as I think is necessary to move this process along.” A new World Bank debt study published on Monday showed that among countries eligible for the G20 debt relief programme, external debt climbed 9.5 percent in 2019 to $744bn before the pandemic hit. The poorest countries’ official bilateral debt to G20 countries reached $178bn in 2019, with 63 percent of the total owed to China.

The leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) nations have pledged to raise $600bn in private and public funds over five years to finance infrastructure in developing countries and counter China’s older, multitrillion-dollar Belt and Road project.

This isn’t aid or charity. It’s an investment that will deliver returns for everyone,” Biden said, adding that it would allow countries to “see the concrete benefits of partnering with democracies”. Biden said hundreds of billions of additional dollars could come from multilateral development banks, development finance institutions, sovereign wealth funds and others. Europe will mobilise 300 billion euros ($317bn) for the initiative over the same period to build up a sustainable alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative scheme, which Chinese President Xi Jinping launched in 2013, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the gathering. The leaders of Italy, Canada and Japan also spoke about their plans, some of which have already been announced separately. French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson were not present, but their countries are also participating. China’s investment scheme involves development and programmes in more than 100 countries aimed at creating a modern version of the ancient Silk Road trade route from Asia to Europe. White House officials said the plan has provided little tangible benefit for many developing countries, and that it traps receiving countries in debt and with investments that benefit China more than their hosts. Biden highlighted several flagship projects, including a $2bn solar development project in Angola with support from the Commerce Department, the US Export-Import Bank, US firm AfricaGlobal Schaffer, and US project developer Sun Africa. Together with G7 members and the European Union, Washington will also provide $3.3m in technical assistance to Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal as it develops an industrial-scale, flexible, multi-vaccine manufacturing facility in that country that can eventually produce COVID-19 and other vaccines, a project that also involves the EU. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) will also commit up to $50m over five years to the World Bank’s global Childcare Incentive Fund. Friederike Roder, vice president of the non-profit group Global Citizen, said the pledges of investment could be “a good start” towards greater engagement by G7 countries in developing nations and could underpin stronger global growth for all. G7 countries on average provide just 0.32 percent of their gross national income — less than half of the 0.7 percent promised — in development assistance, she said. “But without developing countries, there will be no sustainable recovery of the world economy,” she said.",2013-2017,3,high_conflict

Nkurunziza Alphonse knows that every time he goes out to protest, he could get arrested, even detained for a lengthy period in Kampala’s maximum security prison. It has happened before. Still, as he sat in a courtroom on Tuesday, watching another batch of protesters arraigned, Alphonse said he has no plans to stop marching. The 25-year-old student is one of scores of people detained in recent months by Ugandan authorities for demonstrating against an oil pipeline project. The nearly 1,445km (898-mile) long East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) will stretch from Uganda to Tanzania’s coast, transporting crude. It is set to be the longest heated-oil pipeline in the world. However, activists say it will displace thousands, destroy wetlands and contaminate water sources.

State-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) is licensed to drill the oil, alongside French petroleum company, Total Energies. Several Chinese banks have also funded or plan to finance the project. In June, Alphonse, whose village in northern Uganda will see the pipeline run through it, joined thousands across the continent and abroad to march in front of buildings of key stakeholders, particularly Chinese embassies. “In my hometown, people are already losing their lands because of this – the government just comes and tells them to pack up and leave,” Alphonse, a member of the Students Against EACOP organisation, told Al Jazeera. “We are pressuring China and others because they are the ones that will bring the money for this – the Ugandan government can’t do it on their own. We want to bring the realities of the already affected people to them. We want to ensure [the Ugandan government] face a funding crisis.” The backlash is a marker of some challenges China faces in its ambitious attempts to befriend African states, expand its infrastructural footprint, and wield diplomatic influence over the 50-plus countries it engages with on the continent. Even as President Xi Jinping fetes the continent’s leaders at a glossy summit in Beijing this week, the EACOP protests point to greater complexities in their relationship. China’s moves in Africa have long faced scrutiny from Beijing’s rivals in the West, who have been losing political favour on the continent. Detractors – notably the United States – are quick to paint the partnership as one that largely benefits China to the detriment of African countries. However, experts say things are far from black and white. Many accuse Western countries of predatory behaviour on the continent too, pointing to their colonial legacies and the fact that lenders like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) are accused of exploiting African nations through loans. Many also argue that Beijing’s investments have helped Africa modernise and provided thousands of jobs. “That narrative [of China exploiting Africa] makes sense for [Western countries] because of their declining influence in Africa,” said Jana de Kluvier, a researcher focused on China-Africa relations at the South Africa-based Institute of Security Studies (ISS). “But it skips over a lot of the nuance that’s in the very multifaceted relationship.” Urbanisation love story For more than a decade, China has been Africa’s largest trade partner. It is also the continent’s main creditor, pumping more than $170bn in loans and credit into nearly all 54 nations. For China, the benefits lie in the diplomatic influence it is sure to command at the United Nations, and with which it can counter its US-led Western rivals, de Kluvier said. Beijing’s mega infrastructure investments in Africa also form a crucial part of its global Belt and Road Initiative. The ambitious project began in 2013 and aims to connect China to the rest of Asia, Africa and Europe through a web of ports, railroads and highways. China has also invested in energy production and telecommunications. Several African cities now boast new Chinese-funded or Chinese-built railways, bridges and superhighways. That has aided movement and connection in many countries, enabling governments to shift away from old colonial-era railways that had largely become outdated and non-functional. The massive construction work needed has also provided job opportunities. In Kenya, the Nairobi-Mombasa railway for the first time connected the two important cities in 2017 and halved the road journey duration of 10 hours. More than 25,000 Kenyans were employed to complete it. Nigeria’s Lagos and Gabon’s Port Gentil got deep sea ports, Ethiopia got the Hawassa garment-manufacturing industrial park – the list goes on. Although China as a country is not comparable to Africa as a continent, the two entities have a shared story of needing to rapidly develop and reduce poverty levels, Hong Kong-based urban economist Astrid RN Haas told Al Jazeera. China’s urbanisation trajectory was the fastest the world had experienced, lifting 800 million people out of poverty in 40 years. African countries are urbanising even faster, and the African Union wants big cities to be connected by rail by 2063. “The way that China harnessed productivity was through connectivity, connecting the hinterlands to the main cities,” Haas, who is Austrian-Ugandan, said. “So for African countries, China is really the one to look at as an example.” Chinese investment offerings are attractive to African countries because they are often quicker to materialise than Western promises. They are also not viewed through an “aid lens” and not bogged down by fiscal conditions or even “preaching”, as loans from Western institutions tend to be, writes South-Africa-based researcher Cobus van Staden of the China Global South Project. Western countries have cut funding to some countries based on issues like elections or LGBTQ legislation. Beijing, on the other hand, has positioned itself as an “equal”, a fellow Global South country sidelined by the imperial West, van Staden notes. White elephants Trade between China and Africa is loaded in Beijing’s favour. African imports from China amounted to $173bn in 2023, but combined exports to the Asian country lagged at $109bn, according to the US-based Carnegie Endowment for Peace. While China is Africa’s largest trading partner, for China, the continent constitutes only 4.7 percent of its global trade, it noted. To be sure, experts say there are aspects of the China-Africa relationship that benefit Beijing more when it comes to negotiating deals. For one, African countries negotiate on a bilateral, one-on-one basis, not as a coherent front, weakening their abilities to collectively bargain, and even causing them to compete with each other in jockeying for Chinese investments. De Kluiver of ISS said often, “there’s very little transparency on a lot of these investments”, making it hard to determine if China is fulfilling its promises, or if new commitments are being lumped in with older ones. Then there are white elephant projects. Some constructions take millions of dollars but do not generate enough returns to repay the loans that funded them, making them unproductive. One example may be Uganda, where Chinese loans partly helped build the 51km (32-mile) long four-carrier expressway connecting the capital, Kampala, to the Entebbe international airport in 2018. The highway is reported to be the most expensive road per kilometre in the world and cost $450m in total – more than Uganda spent on all road construction work last year. However, the road has limited access to towns that line its length, limiting economic activity. Uganda has a 40-year window to repay a $350m loan to China. By 2023, authorities had generated $20m. Borrowing from China, private creditors, and multilateral institutions have contributed to countries like Zambia falling into a debt crisis. In 2020, the Southern African country defaulted on its debt. It owes about 12 percent of its external debt to China – the highest of any bilateral lender but lower than what Lusaka owes private creditors. In March, Zambia’s official creditors, including China, agreed to cut interest rates and extend repayment timelines. Debt pressures can sometimes manifest violently. In Kenya, protests turned deadly in June following President William Ruto’s attempts to increase taxes and offset the country’s loans, which are mostly owed to Western lenders. Kenya, which struggles to profit from the Nairobi-Mombasa railway loan, owes about 17 percent of its external debt to China but the World Bank remains its largest creditor. The tax hikes, the Kenyan government said, were in efforts to meet the IMF’s conditions for a bailout fund. International lenders face criticism on the continent for providing loans to desperate countries based on stringent conditions that critics say disproportionately affect the poor. But China has been criticised for its approach too. Beijing’s detractors accuse it of “debt diplomacy” and claim that Chinese creditors deliberately lure African countries into unfavourable loan terms, trap them in high levels of debt, and then seize their assets as a way of extending China’s political dominance. China has repeatedly rejected the suggestions of debt diplomacy in Africa or other regions. “These stereotypes of China are overhyped and I challenge the position that it’s not operating in good faith,” analyst Haas said, pointing out that African leaders and Chinese stakeholders do not have a long history together. “China is actually a new investor and it has a lot to learn. I think they assumed that, because of Africa’s growth, there would be returns but China is now just learning that has not happened in this case.” Indeed, Beijing appears to be cutting down on big-ticket infrastructure projects. Between 2021 and 2023, infrastructure funding fell from $16.5bn to $7.5bn. Local resistance and African agency Investments by Chinese investors – or Western partners – also face challenges when they fail to align with community-level priorities, particularly regarding the environment, says analyst de Kluvier – such as in the EACOP case. Alphonse, the Ugandan student activist, accuses the government in Kampala and Chinese investors of not engaging in dialogue with local communities before making the decision to greenlight the pipeline. “They didn’t do anything of the sort,” he said, pointing out that the EACOP project should be dropped regardless because of the likely effect on the environment. About 14,000 households could lose their farm and residential lands in Uganda and Tanzania for the pipeline, which is roughly 100,000 people, according to advocacy organisation STOP EACOP. A third of the tube will pass beside Lake Victoria, Africa’s largest, opening its diverse ecosystem to possible leaks, according to a report by the United Kingdom-based charity, Oxfam. Total Energies says it has consulted local communities and carried out impact studies. The company says it is set to compensate some 18,800 families and farmers it estimates will be affected. “People’s properties are already being undervalued because of it. People are already suffering, they’ve lost their land and there was no dialogue over this,” Alphonse said. Resentment over EACOP adds to simmering tensions among Ugandan business owners who have complained about competing with Chinese traders flooding markets in the country. The situation mirrors wider discontent with cheap Chinese-made goods that appear to overshadow made-in-Africa products across the continent. S",2013-2017,25,high_conflict

Beijing is one of Kyiv’s most crucial trading partners, but their political ties have been hampered by Russia’s full-scale invasion. Kyiv, Ukraine – Back in the 1990s, China’s nascent capitalism triggered demand for Ukrainian steel slabs and iron ore, corn and sunflower oil. However, the most prized export items from impoverished Ukraine were the Soviet-era arsenal of weapons it did not think it needed any more. Recommended Stories list of 4 items- list 1 of 4Ukraine claims strike on Russian submarine in Novorossiysk with sea drones - list 2 of 4Europe establishes Ukraine reparations commission amid push to end war - list 3 of 4“Security guarantee” for Ukrainians remains a “circular discussion” - list 4 of 4Russia-Ukraine war: Is a ceasefire deal on the horizon? Kyiv sold Beijing aerospace components, helicopter and tank engines, and technology transfers for the manufacturing of radars, naval gas turbines and jet engines, helping to reshape China’s defence industry. It even admitted to illegally shipping six nuclear-capable Kh-55 cruise missiles. The pinnacle of military-industrial exports was the 1998 sale of the Soviet-era Varyag aircraft carrier, whose construction began but never finished on the wharves of the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv. Beijing pledged to use the 306-metre (1,004-foot) long vessel for training but turned it into its first aircraft carrier, Liaoning. ‘China can end the war’ The tables have turned during the Russia-Ukraine war, when China became the side that profits the most from the fierce competition between Russian and Ukrainian drone developers. It is “always” a Chinese manufacturer of unmanned aircraft “who earns the most”, Andrey Pronin, one of the drone warfare pioneers in Ukraine, told Al Jazeera. He was standing in the storeroom of his school for drone pilots on the outskirts of Kyiv – next to a dozen drones that ranged from what looked like a tiny replica of a World War I biplane to a jet-driven mini-missile to tiny first-person-view drones. Each of them consisted of Chinese-made components – engines, flight controllers, batteries, thermal cameras and navigation modules. These components have been the backbone of Ukraine’s drone industry, which churns out millions of loitering munitions annually. They are also one of the reasons why Ukraine has not lost the war. “China can end the war in one day by just turning off the export [of drone parts] either to us or to Russians,” Pronin said. Ukrainian drone manufacturers work frantically to localise the production of key components, such as frames, avionics, engines and radios, according to a report by Snake Island, a military research group in Kyiv. And yet, “the industry still depends on a narrow set of critical imports – lithium salts, neodymium magnets, navigation chips, and thermal sensors – where China holds disproportionate leverage”, it said in a report released in October. Should the strategic partnership be restored? What is even more important to Kyiv is how, not if, it will rebuild ties with Beijing after the war is over. In 2011, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Kyiv and signed a strategic partnership agreement with his then-Ukrainian counterpart, Viktor Yanukovych, who was staunchly pro-Russian. Before the 2013 launch of its Belt and Road Initiative, a mammoth project to build transport infrastructure from China to Europe, Beijing counted on Ukraine to become its focal point. Ukraine has a Black Sea coast and borders the delta of the Danube River, an ancient trade route that flows through or borders nine European nations. But in early 2014, Yanukovych fled to Russia after a months-long popular uprising – and weeks later, Moscow annexed Crimea and spurred a separatist revolt in southeastern Ukraine. Seeing Beijing as Russia’s main international backer, Kyiv cooled ties with China. “These days, our ties, political ties, are at point zero – at a moment when China is Ukraine’s main economic partner,” Kyiv-based analyst Vadym Denysenko told a news conference earlier this month. In 2020, the China-Ukraine trade turnover reached $15.4bn, amounting to about one-seventh of Kyiv’s foreign trade. Despite the war, China still has not lost its appetite for Ukrainian grain, steel, vegetables, oil and soya beans – and these exports help keep Ukraine’s economy afloat. After the war, Kyiv will have to rebuild and expand ties with Beijing – at least because its geographic position between the Black Sea and the European Union is still “very interesting” to the Belt and Road Initiative, Denysenko said. ‘Not beneficial for Russia’ Ukraine will need to replace its czarist-era railways with Western ones that have a narrower track gauge and expand its port on the Danube to give China better access to the EU, according to a detailed report by Kyiv-based analyst Igar Tyshkevich. Irrespective of Beijing’s post-war ties with Moscow, Kyiv will need to boost its export of steel and foodstuffs to China, allow Beijing to open plants to assemble Chinese cars and machine tools, and use Ukrainian steel, the report said. “We need localisation with the possibility of buying out rights to certain brands,” Tyshkevich said. Ukraine could use its Soviet-era expertise to create joint projects to develop aircraft, pharmaceuticals and nuclear energy. “Because Ukraine’s participation not only as a recipient, but as a transit country, as a key player that also influences the development of these projects, of course, is not beneficial for Russia,” he said. Other analysts agree that China’s sphere of interest is too large to ignore and that Ukraine should become part of it. Kyiv’s failure to restore ties with China “will cost our nation dearly”, Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. “Essentially, our diplomacy didn’t just write off China, but the entire Global South, or more than half of the globe,” he said, referring to the nations in Asia, Africa and Latin America that were once European colonies and are opposed to Western domination. Ukraine should become part of “the Eurasian Steppe Corridor” from northeast China via Kazakhstan, the Southern Caucasus to the Black Sea nations – Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine, he said. It implies Ukraine joining Eurasian logistical routes and a conception of Ukraine as “a hub nation, a bridge nation, a plastic link nation”, he said. “Everything should be done so that goods move across the Eurasian Steppe Corridor, not foreign troops,” Kushch said.",2013-2017,9,high_conflict

China has slammed Washington’s “Cold War mentality” in Latin America after Panama quit its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China on Friday hit out at the United States for sabotaging the global infrastructure programme.

Jian noted that more than 20 Latin American nations are among the more than 150 countries that have participated in the BRI since it was rolled out by China in 2013. Panama in 2017 became the first in the region to officially join the massive infrastructure plan, which is a central pillar of President Xi Jinping’s bid to expand his country’s global influence. But on Thursday, Panama’s President Jose Raul Mulino said his country has formally lodged a notice that it will leave the project. The announcement followed a visit by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who also toured the Panama Canal. President Donald Trump has repeatedly accused Panama of ceding control of the strategic waterway to China, despite denials from both countries. Mulino denied that the US had pushed Panama to make the move to quit the BRI. Rubio, who had threatened action against Panama unless it made immediate changes to reduce Chinese influence on the canal, hailed the announcement as a “great step forward” for bilateral relations. Beijing on Friday insisted that it “supports Panama’s sovereignty over the canal”. “We hope that Panama will make the right decision based on the overall situation of bilateral relations and the long-term interests of the two peoples, and eliminate external interference,” Jian said.",2013-2017,4,high_conflict

But many nations are also indebted to private Western lenders. Many of the world’s poorest countries are due to make record debt repayments to China in 2025 on loans extended a decade ago, at the peak of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative, a report by the Sydney-based Lowy Institute think tank has found. Under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a state-backed infrastructure investment programme launched in 2013, Beijing lent billions of dollars to build ports, highways and railroads to connect Asia, Africa and the Americas. Recommended Stories list of 4 items- list 1 of 4Have Trump’s tariff threats helped China boost its exports? - list 2 of 4Why China isn’t as worried about Trump’s trade war as in 2018 - list 3 of 4IMF warns Trump tariffs fuels uncertain global economic outlook - list 4 of 4Is the US dollar at risk of a ‘confidence crisis’? But new lending is drying up. In 2025, debt repayments owed to China by developing countries will amount to $35bn. Of that, $22bn is set to be paid by 75 of the world’s poorest countries, putting health and education spending at risk, Lowy concluded. “For the rest of this decade, China will be more debt collector than banker to the developing world,” said Riley Duke, the report’s author. “Developing countries are grappling with a tidal wave of debt repayments and interest costs to China,” Duke said. What did the report say? China’s BRI, the biggest multilateral development programme ever undertaken by a single country, is one of President Xi Jinping’s hallmark foreign policy initiatives. It focuses primarily on developing country infrastructure projects like power plants, roads and ports, which struggle to receive financial backing from Western financial institutions. The BRI has turned China into the largest global supplier of bilateral loans, peaking at about $50bn in 2016 – more than all Western creditors combined. According to the Lowy report, however, paying off these debts is now jeopardising public spending. “Pressure from Chinese state lending, along with surging repayments to a range of international private creditors, is putting enormous financial strain on developing economies.” High debt servicing costs can suffocate spending on public services like education and healthcare, and limit their ability to respond to economic and climate shocks. The 46 least developed countries (LDCs) spent a significant share – about 20 percent – of their tax revenues on external public debt in 2023. Lowy’s report implies this will increase even more this year. For context, Germany used 8.4 percent of its budget to repay debt in 2023. Lowy also raised questions about whether China will use these debts for “geopolitical leverage” in the Global South, especially with Washington slashing foreign aid under President Donald Trump. “As Beijing shifts into the role of debt collector, Western governments remain internally focused, with aid declining and multilateral support waning,” the report said. While Chinese lending is also beginning to slow down across the developing world, the report said there were two areas that seemed to be bucking the trend. The first was in nations such as Honduras, Burkina Faso and Solomon Islands, which received massive new loans after switching diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China. The other was in countries such as Indonesia and Brazil, where China has signed new loan deals to secure critical minerals and metals for electric batteries. How has China responded? Beijing’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was “not aware of the specifics” of the report but that “China’s investment and financing cooperation with developing countries abides by international conventions”. Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said “a small number of countries” sought to blame Beijing for miring developing nations in debt but that “falsehoods cannot cover up the truth”. For years, the BRI has been criticised by Western commentators as a way for Beijing to entrap countries with unserviceable debt. An often-cited example is the Hambantota port – located along vital east-west international shipping routes – in southern Sri Lanka. Unable to repay a $1.4bn loan for the port’s construction, Colombo was forced to lease the facility to a Chinese firm for 99 years in 2017. China’s government has denied accusations it deliberately creates debt traps, and recipient nations have also pushed back, saying China was often a more reliable partner than the West and offered crucial loans when others refused. Still, China publishes little data on its BRI scheme, and the Lowy Institute said its estimates, based on World Bank data, may underestimate the full scale of China’s lending. In 2021, AidData – a US-based international development research lab – estimated that China was owed a “hidden debt” of about $385bn. Does the Lowy report lack ‘context’? Challenging the “debt-trap” narrative, the Rhodium consulting group looked at 38 Chinese debt renegotiations with 24 developing countries in 2019 and concluded that Beijing’s leverage was limited, with many of the renegotiations resolved in favour of the borrower. According to Rhodium, developing countries had restructured roughly $50bn of Chinese loans in the decade before its 2019 study was published, with loan extensions, cheaper financing and debt forgiveness the most frequent outcomes. Elsewhere, a 2020 study by the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins University found that, between 2000 and 2019, China cancelled $3.4bn of debt in Africa and a further $15bn was refinanced. No assets were seized. Meanwhile, many developing countries remain in hock to Western institutions. In 2022, the Debt Justice Group estimated that African governments owed three times more to private financial groups than to China, charging double the interest in the process. “Developing country debt to China is less than what is owed to both private bondholders and multilateral development banks (MDBs),” says Kevin Gallagher, director of the Boston University Global Development Policy Center. “So, Lowy’s focus on China lacks context. The truth is, even if you remove China from the creditor picture, lots of poor countries would still be in debt distress,” Gallagher told Al Jazeera. Following the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, inflation prompted the United States Federal Reserve, as well as other leading central banks, to hike interest rates. Attracted to higher yields in the US, investors withdrew their funds from developing country financial assets, raising yield costs and depreciating currencies. Debt repayment costs soared. Global interest rates have since come down slightly. But according to the UN, developing country borrowing costs are, on average, two to four times higher than in the US and six to 12 times higher than in Germany. “A crucial aspect about Chinese lending,” said Gallagher, “is that it tends to be long-term and growth enhancing. That’s precisely why a lot of it is focused on infrastructure investment. Western lenders tend to get in and out faster and charge higher rates.”",2013-2017,30,high_conflict
16,2013,aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/12/22/china-to-open-its-first-naval-base-in-africa,en,"China to open its first naval base in Africa With the establishment of a base in Djibouti, China joins the global contest for maritime and commercial supremacy. China recently announced a landmark agreement with Djibouti to establish Beijing’s first overseas naval base in its modern history. The agreement opens the door to the creation of a permanent Chinese military presence on the African continent – at a key geopolitical address bordering the Bab el-Mandeb Strait guarding the approaches to Suez along the Arabian peninsula and the interior of East Africa. In remarks on November 26, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry sought to downplay the move’s strategic significance. “In accordance with relevant UN resolutions,” explained spokesman Hong Lei, “China has deployed more than 60 vessels in the Gulf of Aden and the waters off the Somali coast in 21 [anti-piracy] escort missions since 2008. In the process of escorting, we encountered real difficulties in replenishing soldiers and resupplying fuel and food, and found it really necessary to have nearby and efficient logistical support.” Notwithstanding such benign explanations, China’s establishment of a permanent facility in this region marks a critical step in the maritime expansion and strategic creation of a Chinese “blue water” navy capable of operating globally. “[China is] going to build a base in Djibouti, so that will be their first military location in Africa,” explained David Rodriguez, the commander of US Africa Command. Washington’s support for China’s increased participation in international maritime security efforts, like the one operating off the Somali coast, is one thing. China’s growing appetite to contest Washington’s command of the seas, as it is doing in the South China Sea in particular, however, is something else entirely. The competitive context – strategically as well as economically – of China’s move to establish a base on the African coast, where the US Navy has long-reigned supreme, is self-evident. Senator Chris Coons, a senior member of the Senate foreign relations subcommittee on African affairs, said that the US has to be “vigilant in the face of China’s growing ambitions. Overall, China’s presence in Africa is certainly something we need to pay more attention to, but not just in Djibouti.” A new maritime order? “Trade follows the flag” has been the calling card for global maritime powers for millennia. In China’s case, the extraordinary expansion of its global trade in recent years has been enabled by the patronage of an international system of trade and security dominated by the US. China, is now signalling, in this and in so many other ways, its intent to establish a system of international trade and security that “looks like China” rather than Washington. China’s agreement with Djibouti marks yet another milestone in the evolving transition to a new system. The growing port at Djibouti, the largest on the continent's east coast, is one cog in this growing network, an important prize in the global contest to operate, own, and control port facilities at critical points along growing trade routes. Djibouti, a tiny country of less than 25,000 square kilometres with a population of less than one million, already hosts bases belonging to France and the US. The latter, Camp Lemonnier, is home to 5,000 US personnel, who fly drone and other missions to Yemen and Somalia as part of SOCOM – the shadowy special operations command that in recent years has spearheaded the expansion of Washington’s own military campaign against jihadis in the region. The evacuation of 83 Chinese and Sri Lankan nationals from Yemen earlier this year, and the killing of three Chinese rail executives in the recent hotel siege in Mali, highlight China’s growing exposure to security challenges in the volatile region. The driving force behind China’s move to establish a permanent naval presence in the region, however, is Beijing’s determination to create a new system of trade and, therefore, security that will reflect China’s interests. There are two related elements to the Chinese effort – Chinese-financed economic development and the establishment of an international trade and security infrastructure to support it. Global trade network The “Maritime Silk Road” is part of the overarching multibillion dollar Silk Road economic belt trade and infrastructure project announced in September 2013. It aims to create a new Chinese-inspired system of global trade and commerce, linking China’s ports with those of the Asian subcontinent, the Arabian peninsula, the Red Sea and Suez to the port of Piraeus – now run under contract by a Chinese company, China Ocean Shipping Company (Cosco). The growing port at Djibouti, the largest on the continent’s east coast, is one cog in this growing network, an important prize in the global contest to operate, own, and control port facilities at critical points along growing trade routes. OPINION: China has just become a global financial giant The United Arab Emirates’ Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan’s visit to China last week was undertaken in the context of the broader Chinese interest in cementing partnerships along the trade routes identified as part of the Maritime Silk Road. The UAE company DB Ports plays a critical role in this international contest to “claim space” along international trade routes, including Djibouti where it operates the Doraleh Container Terminal. The crown prince explained that the UAE will support and participate in the Belt and Road Initiative and play an active part in China’s new Asian Development Bank. Djibouti is the first, but certainly not the last example of the revolution China is leading not only in trade and development but also in international security throughout Africa and the broader Middle East.

17,2013,aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2018/10/23/will-china-abandon-the-palestinians,en,"Will China abandon the Palestinians? China appears to be operating with the mistaken assumption that it can be pro-Palestine and pro-Israel at once. China’s Vice President Wang Qishan arrived in Israel on Monday for a four-day visit to head the fourth China-Israel Innovation Committee. He is the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit Israel in nearly two decades. In April 2000, the former president of China, Jiang Zemin was the first Chinese leader to ever visit Israel, touring the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum and paying diplomatic dues to his Israeli counterparts. Then, he spoke of China’s intentions to cement the bond between the two countries. Wang Qishan’s visit, however, is different. The “bond” between Beijing and Tel Aviv is much stronger now than it was then, as expressed in sheer numbers. Soon after the two countries exchanged diplomatic missions in 1992, trade figures began increasing. The size of Chinese investments in Israel also grew exponentially, from $50m in the early 1990s to a whopping $16.5bn according to 2016 estimates. On this visit, Qishan is joined by Jack Ma, founder of China’s top e-commerce firm, Alibaba. Ma was also in Israel in May to prepare the ground for the ongoing summit, which is expected to yield massive new investments. Much of these investments will be focused on technology, which makes the nature of the China-Israel relationship different from that which bonded Beijing with Arab countries for decades. China’s total trade with Arab countries is also massive, estimated at $171bn. However, the nature of the exchange is different if compared with that between China and Israel. China is a main client for Israel’s IT industry, while its trade with Arab countries is mostly focused on selling cheaper consumer goods and, as of late, military hardware. Enter “Belt and Road Initiative” China’s vice president’s visit to Israel comes at the heels of accelerated efforts by Beijing to promote its mammoth trillion-dollar economic project, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). China hopes that its grand plan will help it open massive new opportunities across the world and eventually guarantee its dominance in various regions that rotated, since World War II, within an American sphere of influence. BRI aims to connect Asia, Africa, and Europe through a “belt” of overland routes and a maritime “road” of sea lanes. The China-US competition is heating up. Washington wants to hold on its global dominance for as long as possible while Beijing is eagerly working to supplant the US’s superpower status, first in Asia, then in Africa and the Middle East. In Africa, China has pumped massive amounts of cash that is being spent mostly on economic development projects. The Chinese strategy in achieving its objectives is quite clear: unlike the US’s disproportionate investments in military power, China is keen on winning its coveted status, at least for the time being, using soft power only. The Middle East, however, is far richer and thus more strategic and contested than any other region in the world. Rife with conflicts and distinct political camps, it is likely to derail China’s soft power strategy sooner rather than later. While Chinese foreign policy managed to survive the polarizing war in Syria through engaging all sides and playing second to Russia’s leading role at the UN Security Council, the Israeli occupation of Palestine is a whole different political challenge. China’s Balancing Act For years, China has maintained a consistent position in support of the Palestinian people, calling for an end to the Israeli occupation and for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. However, Beijing’s firm position regarding the rights of Palestinians, seems as of little consequence to its relationship with Israel, as joint technological ventures, trade and investments continue to grow unhindered. China’s foreign policymakers operate with the mistaken assumption that their country can be pro-Palestine and pro-Israel at once, criticizing the occupation, yet sustaining it; calling on Israel to respect international law while at the same time empowering Israel, however unwittingly, in its ongoing violations of Palestinian human rights. With the Palestinian struggle for freedom and human rights is capturing international attention through the rise of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, more and more countries are under pressure to articulate a clear stance on the Israeli occupation and apartheid. For China to enter the fray with an indecisive and self-serving strategy is not just morally objectionable, but strategically unsustainable as well. The Palestinian and Arab peoples are hardly interested in swapping American military dominance with Chinese economic hegemony that does little to change or, at least challenge, the prevailing status quo. As it stands, China’s Belt and Road Initiative is largely devoid of any political substance, despite the fact that the Middle East will play a vital role in this 21st century Silk Road that has the potential to revolutionise the geopolitical world order completely. In fact, the Middle East region has been described as “the place where the Belt joins the Road”. China’s growing investments and strategic ties to Israel are predicated on both countries’ keen interest in technological innovation, as well as on the so-called “Red-Med” Railway, a regional network of sea and rail infrastructure aimed at connecting China with Europe via Asia and the Middle East. Additionally, the railway would also link the two Israeli ports of Eilat and Ashdod. News of China’s plan to manage the Israeli port of Haifa has already raised the ire of the US and its European allies. Times have changed, indeed. Whereas in the past, Washington ordered Tel Aviv to immediately cease exchanging American military technology with China, forcing it to cancel the sale of the Phalcon airborne early-warning system, it is now watching as Israeli and Chinese leaders are managing the dawn of a new political era that – for the first time – doesn’t include Washington. Alexander B Pevzner, founding director of the Chinese Media Center (CMC) is one of the many enthusiastic supporters of what he calls the “systematic dialogue” between Israel and China. He told The Diplomat that Israel’s “stability is the exception in the turbulent Middle East”. It seems that the oft-repeated cliche of Israel being “the only democracy in the Middle East”, is being slightly adjusted to meet the expectations of a fledgeling superpower, which is merely interested in technology, trade and investments. Israeli leaders want China and its investors to think of Israel as the “only stable economy in the Middle East.” And BRI, according to Pevzner “is the new game in town”. Israel seeking new partners Although ties between Washington and Tel Aviv are stronger than ever, Israeli leaders are aware of a vastly changing political landscape. The US’s own political turmoil and the global power realignment, which is on full display in the Middle East, indicate that a new era is, indeed in the making. The last global realignment took place immediately following WWII. As Europe and much of Asia stood in ruins, a revitalised American economy pulled the world out of desolation through the Marshall Plan and other initiatives. It was then that the US established itself as the “pater familias”, a patronizing figure on the international arena, enforcing its rules and protection as if a loving, but authoritative father. Israel understands that China’s ultimate motive is to change that long-prevailing reality. Tel Aviv, therefore, aims to secure for itself a strong position whereby it continues to harvest aid and support from its traditional western allies, while slowly cementing its relationship with Beijing. China, on the other hand, has been experimenting with more pronounced political strategies in the region. In 2013, it produced the four-point plan to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict. In 2017 it pushed its plan in earnest, using the Palestine-Israel peace symposium as a platform to articulate a clearer Chinese foreign policy. In fact, last year’s symposium was the first to be sponsored by the administration of Chinese President Xi Jinping. China’s “peace plan” – a mere reiteration of the long-standing UN position on the issue – received little international attention. That, however, may change in the future as China’s role in the Middle East continues to grow. China and Palestine Beijing’s position on Palestine, at least officially, has always been consistent. Back in the 1960’s, China was the first non-Arab country to enter into diplomatic relations with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Beijing has long endorsed the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian State, within the 1967 boundaries and with East Jerusalem as its capital. After the 2006 parliamentary elections in the Occupied Territories, unlike the US, the Chinese government refused to label Hamas a “terrorist organisation” and defended the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. It went even further. To the fury of Israel, Beijing defined Hamas as the “chosen representative of the Palestinian people.” While China’s official political discourse on Israel and Palestine remained consistent, a dual strategy was being formulated after the announcement of the BRI. It was then that China felt the need to offer its own mediation through the four-point “peace plan” and refrain from supporting one side against the other. “From a Chinese perspective, the political stance in favour of a Palestinian State does not preclude the economic ties with Israel,” Diego Angelo Bertozzi, author of The Belt and Road Initiative, told us. The same Chinese logic applies to the rest of the region. China’s “thriving trade relations with Syria and Iran do not preclude the deepening relations with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, insofar as Beijing aims to establish itself as an equidistant and stabilizing world power,” according to Bertozzi. For now, China is maybe able to walk that fine line. But what would happen in the case of outright conflict, especially if the US and China’s trade wars morphed into a limited or large-scale military confrontation? Israel then is likely to side with the US, and China’s technological secrets and access to Israeli ports might be used against it. Sadly, while Beijing and Tel Aviv labour to strike the needed balance between foreign policies and economic interests, China finds itself under no particular obligation to side with a well-defined Arab position on Palestine, simply because the latter doesn’t exist. The political division of Arab countries, the wars in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere have pushed Palestine down from being a top Arab priority into some strange bargain involving “regional peace” as part of Trump’s so-called “Deal of the Century”. This painful reality has weakened Palestine’s position in China, which, at least for now, values its relationship with Israel at a much higher level than its historical bond with Palestine and the Palestinian people.

18,2013,aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2019/8/28/china-enters-the-balkans,en,"China enters the Balkans Can Beijing leverage its investments to become another major player in the region? In October 2009, a small town in central Bulgaria named Lovech welcomed a Chinese dignitary that few in the country, let alone in the town, had heard of. Xi Jinping, then China’s vice president, was on a European tour, gathering experience in foreign affairs as he was moving on to the pinnacle of power. In Lovech, he witnessed the signing of a joint venture deal between Bulgarian diversified holding company Litex Commerce and the Great Wall Motors, one of China’s leading automotive manufacturers. Then the up-and-coming politician took off to Bucharest. The manufacturing plant in Lovech went bust in 2017, but the hunger for Chinese investment remained. Ten years down the road, it is Balkan leaders who are heading to Beijing, eager to meet Xi. While the United States is embroiled in a trade war against China and most Western governments fret about tech companies like Huawei, Southeast Europeans are still eager to get deals on roads, bridges, power plants and greenfield manufacturing projects from Beijing. In April 2012, just a year before Xi became president, China launched the 16+1 initiative, a platform bringing together China and 11 EU member countries in Eastern Europe as well as five candidate states in the Western Balkans. There has been no shortage of interest in this forum on the Balkans. In 2018, Sofia hosted the forum; this year, it was held in Croatia’s historic town of Dubrovnik. Belgrade and Bucharest have had their turns too in past years. Lately, Greece, too, has made an effort to join this grouping of post-communist states, which has been rebranded 17+1. This year, a number of top officials from the Balkans made the lengthy trip to Beijing. In April, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic met Xi in the Chinese capital; a day later Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras followed suit. In May, Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos also showed up in Beijing. In July, Bulgarian President Rumen Radev paid an official visit, too. The region’s interest in Chinese investments, however, has not gone unnoticed. Officials and China-watchers in the EU, wary of Beijing’s policy to maximise its clout through divide-and-conquer tactics, have been voicing concern. “Maybe we have overestimated Russia and underestimated China” when it comes to their reach in the Balkans, Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn told Financial Times in March. Hahn is concerned that the Western Balkans risk being trapped in debt, a view shared by the Munich Security Forum. He might have a point. While Russia is good at playing the Slavic brotherhood card and loves to talk tough against the West, it lacks the economic heft to present a credible challenge. China, with a GDP of more than $12 trillion, is in a different league. At three percent of the overall inflow, Chinese investment into the region – which is largely based on loans benefitting Chinese infrastructure companies – pales in comparison to that of the EU, which accounts for around two-thirds. Yet ambitious ventures such as the Belt and Road Initiative unveiled by Beijing in 2013 would no doubt lead to an increase. Some of the money has already poured in. Thanks to the acquisition of the steel plant in Smederevo by Chinese company HBIS, China’s share in the overall stock of foreign direct investment in Serbia jumped from 6 to more than 20 percent. The Exim Bank of China is also financing the modernisation of two sections of the railway connecting Belgrade and Budapest. The contracts implemented by the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) are worth $1.5bn. The Serbian government has been in talks to purchase Chinese-made drones as part of a deal that will also involve technology transfer, allowing the country’s defence industry to eventually produce its own UAVs in the long term. Belgrade has been procuring face-recognition software, too. Following a recent visit by his counterpart from China, Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic touted joint police patrols and even military exercises. Meanwhile, trade has tripled between 2005 and 2016, reaching $1.6bn in volume. Serbia is becoming “China’s open door to the Balkans”, according to some observers. How far Chinese-Serbian cooperation can go remains to be seen. But what is certain is that Vucic does not mind sitting on more than just two chairs, as a senior US diplomat once characterised Serbia’s dance between the West and Russia. Apart from Serbia, China is also making large investments in other parts of the Balkans too, namely in infrastructure and energy. Since 2009, Chinese company COSCO has been in charge of the main Greek port of Pireus, first as an operator and then as a majority owner. Until 2017, COSCO was also bidding for the Thessaloniki port. In Croatia, member of the EU since 2013, a Chinese consortium is building a 2.4km-long bridge connecting the Peljesac Peninsula and the village of Komarna, both on the Adriatic coast. The project has attracted a fair share of publicity: first, because it cuts across the gulf of Neum shared with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and, therefore, impedes its access to the high seas; second, because the bridge is largely funded by the EU. A subsidiary of CCCC, a Chinese state-owned enterprise, is benefitting from a $396m grant from Brussels. China has been involved in road construction projects in Montenegro and North Macedonia, as well. In Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina, China started building a thermal plant in, backed by a $777m loan from Exim Bank. This was after in March, political factions in the Federation, one of the country’s two entities, made a rare show of unity in parliament giving green light to the project. That happened only after the three Chinese companies involved in the venture threatened to pull out. On this occasion, Beijing’s money went further in disciplining Bosnian politicians than Western overseers of stability in the Balkan state. Bulgaria is similarly hopeful of attracting Chinese investment into the energy sector. The government insists China National Nuclear Corporation is interested in the Belene nuclear power plant. Is China able and willing to use its ever-growing investments in the Balkans to expand its political footprint? Perhaps yes, but in the short to medium term, China is not likely to stake a claim on regional security. It will remain a geo-economic power, as far as the Balkans is concerned. As noted by Anastas Vangeli, an expert of Chinese foreign policy from North Macedonia, local countries are interested in China and the EU working in sync rather than competing. Yet it is a golden rule in politics that perception is reality. Tensions between the West and Beijing would no doubt be felt in Europe’s periphery.

19,2013,aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/11/18/the-chinese-miracle-and-the-american-debacle,en,"China’s rise and America’s decline spell conflict Monday’s summit between Xi and Biden addressed everything from trade to security and human rights, but resolved nothing. This week’s Chinese American summit was sweet and sour. The three-hour virtual meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping started respectfully, was even friendly, but soon descended into recriminations and veiled threats. No surprise there. The friction between these two leading world powers has grown too wide and deep to bridge with diplomatic niceties. They disagree on almost everything from trade and security to human rights, and in the rare case they agree on an outcome, they disagree on the process. But some of the disagreements, such as the future of Taiwan, are boiling over, risking bringing the two powers into direct confrontation in a reckless test of wills. Beijing seems to insist on bringing the self-governed island back into the fold, by force, if necessary, while Washington appears determined to push back against China’s use of military intimidation and economic and diplomatic blackmail to strong-arm Taiwan into submission. So, while both leaders have officially committed to maintaining the status quo in Taiwan in the context of the “One China” policy, they also took time at the summit to put each other on notice. President Xi warned the US against interfering in intra-Chinese affairs, and cautioned that “whoever plays with fire will get burned”. President Biden, who had hastily promised to defend Taiwan against any Beijing aggression in the past, meanwhile, warned China against the repercussions of altering the status of Taiwan by force, which in my view are more likely to be economic than military – but no less disruptive. In that way, the summit has addressed everything from security, trade to human rights, but resolved nothing. It merely clarified the rules of engagement moving forward once the three-hour diplomatic truce is over. No surprise there either. The disagreement over Taiwan, like those over Hong Kong and North Korea, is a symptom of a far greater conflict over supremacy in Asia and indeed, the world – all of which invokes a comparison with the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Yes, I am mindful of the pitfalls of such an analogy, aware of both the similarities and dissimilarities between the two eras, and yes, I am conscious of the fact that China, unlike the USSR, is deeply integrated into the western-led international system, and does not seek world domination through an alternative global ideology. Not yet anyway. But the similarities are becoming uncanny as a rising China begins to pose a strategic challenge to the global system similar to that of the Soviet Union; as Biden frames the conflict between the US and China in ideological terms (a clash between democracy and autocracy); and as both sides show a willingness to resort to all means necessary to achieve their goals short of a large military confrontation, or a destructive “hot war”. China has certainly pulled ahead of Russia, which is trying to revive its old glory and influence by any means necessary. President Vladimir Putin may play dirty games with the West, but Xi is adamant about rewriting the rules of the game altogether. China’s strongman rejects the “international rules-based order” the West dictates and insists on co-authoring the principles of a new world order. In other words, the US may downplay Moscow’s provocations as the desperate manoeuvres of a “regional power”, but when it comes to Beijing, it has no choice but to pay attention to this bullish and bullying superpower. China has succeeded where it counts, where the Soviet Union had failed – the economy. China’s economy has expanded at an incredible rate and, all things being equal, is destined to surpass that of the US in this decade. China is also developing a strategic doctrine and posture worthy of its economic supremacy, and which includes conventional, naval, digital, space and nuclear military power. There are many ways to quantify the Chinese miracle, no less in comparison with the US. But it suffices for our purpose here to take an overall look at the century since the US emerged as a world power and the Chinese Communist Party was first established, in 1921. In its first half, China suffered from turmoil, disintegration, foreign occupation and horrific famine that killed tens of millions, while the US became a world superpower, comprising 40 to 50 percent of the world economy. China began to get its act together during the past 50 years, which coincided with the US’s recognition of the communist government and the late President Richard Nixon’s historical visit in 1972, the first by a US president. But it was not until 10 years later that China began to widely liberalise and industrialise its economy at a breathtaking pace. Joining the World Trade Organization (WTO), in 2001, has propelled China to global prominence as the “world’s factory”. In the following 20 years, the Chinese economy skyrocketed from the equivalent of 13 percent of the US economy to 73 percent this year; a five-fold increase. In the process, it pulled hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty. Furthermore, Xi’s 2013 multi-trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), spanning more than 60 countries, has ensured China’s strategic enlargement and geopolitical expansion like never before. Interestingly, renewable energy investments reached a new high of 57 percent of BRI’s total for energy projects in 2020. The US may have hoped that China’s membership would mean cheap imported goods and the moderation and democratisation of the Chinese government, but eventually, China’s ascension led to a $300bn annual trade deficit and the communist party tightened its grip on power, alas. As the China miracle unfolded, US power has continued to unravel over the past 20 years, beginning with the debacles of its wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and the greater Middle East and through the 2008 financial crisis and the disastrous Trump presidency, as Washington lost lots of assets, credibility, and influence among friends and foes alike around the world. In the process, the US’s share of the world economy shrank by almost half to 22 percent. That is why Biden, who urged Xi not to let their competition veer into conflict, must tread carefully after the summit ends to ensure the US has the necessary geopolitical clout to deter a bellicose China from making any aggressive moves in Asia and beyond. Likewise, it is incumbent on the Chinese leader, who is feeling super-confident nowadays, to refrain from resorting to unsavoury means or unnecessary threats that could escalate into a large confrontation with dangerous consequences. The world’s wellbeing, indeed its survival, depends on it.",2013-2017,13,high_conflict
20,2013,aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/6/6/russia-faces-a-new-neighbourhood-threat-china,en,"Russia faces a new neighbourhood threat: China Moscow’s Ukraine struggles and neocolonialism have made its former partners in Central Asia turn to Beijing. On May 18, Chinese President Xi Jinping held a lavish ceremony in the ornate Tang Paradise theme park in Xian, the heart of the ancient Silk Road, for five visiting Central Asian presidents who had arrived for the inaugural China-Central Asia summit. Conspicuously, the summit took place at the same time as the G7 meeting of wealthy nations in Hiroshima. Commenting on the two summits, China’s state-run Global Times claimed that the “G7 speaks the language of an outmoded Cold War mentality” while the Xian summit focused on the “promotion of cooperation and inclusiveness”. In his welcoming remarks, Xi hailed the summit as signalling “a new era of China-Central Asia relations”. Xi said that “China is ready to help Central Asian countries strengthen capacity building on law enforcement, security and defence in an effort to safeguard peace in the region”. The summit resulted in a string of economic agreements signalling that China is again open for business after two years of COVID-19 border restrictions. While China consolidates its hegemony in Eurasia, it is also promoting a viable competitive vision to the current United States-led order. Yet it is presenting itself as an alternative leader not just to the US, but also to Russia, which it aims to gradually displace from Central Asia. An uneasy partnership China has grown into the largest economic actor in Central Asia. Total Chinese investments in the region ballooned from $40bn in 2020, to over $70bn by the end of 2022. Russia, which accounted for 80 percent of the region’s trade in the 1990s, now accounts for less than two-thirds of Beijing’s trade. Lurking beneath these big numbers is a growing asymmetry between China and Central Asia. In 2020, an estimated 45 percent of Kyrgyzstan’s external debt, and 52 percent of Tajikistan’s was owed to China. Meanwhile, 75 percent of Turkmenistan’s exports depend on Chinese consumers. The growing debt burdens have been linked to high-level corruption scandals and have resulted in political instability, also undermining Beijing’s credibility. Indeed, Sinophobia has become relatively widespread in Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. According to survey data, 30 percent of Kazakhs and 35 percent of Kyrgyz have a negative view of China. Protests against China’s rising role in the region, perceived by some as taking jobs from locals, polluting the environment, and part of a broader strategy to “colonise” the region, have been on the rise. According to our data, 241 protests related to China took place in Kazakhstan from January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2021, although more than half were related to an ongoing protest by relatives of those detained in Xinjiang’s camps. Some of these protests have turned violent. After the Kyrgyz government was ousted in October 2020 following flawed elections, about 300 locals stormed the Ishtamberdi mine operated by China’s Full Gold Mining, chasing off 132 Chinese workers who were forced to spend the night in a snowy forest. A mob of 100 people also barricaded a group of 35 Chinese businessmen within their hotel in Bishkek. Amid the growing backlash to China’s extreme policies in Xinjiang towards Uighurs and ethnic Kazakhs and Kyrgyz, and the wider Sinophobia in the region, Beijing has solicited support for its policies from Central Asian governments. While Kyrgyzstan offered a statement of support in June 2019, it declined, along with Kazakhstan, to sign a letter to the United Nations backing Beijing’s position the following month. But in October 2022, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan voted to block a UN investigation into China’s human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The issue was also notably absent from the talks in Xian last month. Out of Russia’s shadow In the first two decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, China opted to primarily interact with Central Asia through the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), which also includes Russia as a member. But the Xi Jinping era has seen China increasingly creating its own mechanisms to work with its western neighbours. The Xian summit, hosted by China + C5, a multilateral framework excluding Russia, is a dramatic example of Beijing’s increasingly independent course in the region. While China and Russia proclaimed a “no limits” partnership in February 2022 and have pledged to work together to prevent what they call “colour revolutions” and external interference in the affairs of Central Asia, it is clear that Beijing seeks to displace Russia in its former empire. Beginning with Xi’s announcement of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in an October 2013 speech in Kazakhstan, Central Asia’s engagements with China have in many ways stood at the centre of Beijing’s policy of increased global assertiveness that its media refer to as the “New Era”. Over the past year, China has announced a trio of new policies — the Global Security Initiative, Global Civilization Initiative and the Global Development Initiative — which collectively aim to present an alternative model of international relations to Western liberal norms. The Global Security Initiative, for instance, is Beijing’s pushback against alliances like NATO, with China arguing that the West is trapped in a “Cold War mentality”. While Moscow remains Central Asia’s dominant arms provider, accounting for about 50 percent of all transfers, China’s share of arms imports to the region has increased from 1.5 percent in 2010 to 13 percent today. Since 2016, China has been quietly building a network of military facilities along the Tajik-Afghan border. Unrest in Kazakhstan in January 2022 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have substantially changed the landscape, too. In response to violent protests in Kazakhstan, China reportedly offered assistance. China’s recent declaration of support for Kazakhstan’s national independence and territorial integrity, as well as Xi’s visit to Kazakhstan in September 2022, suggest deeper Chinese security engagement. The Ukraine crisis has made Kazakhstan’s elites more reliant on China, at a time when Russian rhetoric grows increasingly neocolonial. In August 2022, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called Kazakhstan an “artificial state,” echoing a speech by Vladimir Putin in 2014 in which he said Kazakhs had “never known statehood,” prior to the Soviet collapse. Prominent Russian nationalist commentators have issued similar statements in recent months. These threats are felt in Kazakhstan, where 16 percent of the population is ethnic Russian. Russians are concentrated in the north of the country, forming a plurality in the Kostanay and North Kazakhstan regions. Russian nationalists claim that these areas are traditionally part of Russia. In Xian, President Xi told his Kazakh counterpart that China supports “ethnic harmony,” a subtle critique of Russia’s sabre-rattling in northern Kazakhstan. A new era In Hiroshima, G7 leaders talked of the need to “reduce critical dependencies” on China. Europe has also been growing more critical of China, with a recent internal memo calling on European Union member states to “prepare” for a crisis over Taiwan and “de-risk” its dependence on Beijing. But meanwhile, the Xian summit helped China shore up political support for the “reunification” of Taiwan with China and for infrastructure development that would diversify Beijing’s energy sources away from Western ports and sea routes in case of international conflict. All at Russia’s cost, too. Amid its focus on the war in Ukraine, Russia has reportedly weakened its 201st Military Base which as of 2021 had an estimated 7,000 troops stationed at three facilities in Tajikistan. In April, the Ukrainian army claimed it had destroyed a column of the 4th Battalion Tactical Group from this base. Multiple sources have confirmed to us that over 2,000 troops, in addition to at least 30 tanks, have been redeployed to Ukraine. At least 500 soldiers have been redeployed from Russia’s base in Kant, Kyrgyzstan. The Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) military alliance has also proved largely ineffective in resolving either violent territorial disputes between member states Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, or in bolstering member Armenia in its tensions with fellow post-Soviet state Azerbaijan. This has seriously undermined Russia’s commitments to its allies. Against that backdrop, the gathering in Xian had tremendous symbolic value. It signalled that China is positioning itself as a partner of choice for Central Asia that can offer the region what Russia can’t.

Based on the historical Silk Road route used by Chinese explorers and traders to spread their cultural influence, the Belt and Road program launched in 2013 strives to enhance trade connectedness. As Chinese President Xi Jinping stated in the forum’s opening ceremony, “We intend to create one big family based on harmonious co-existence.” He also pledged a further $14.5 billion to fund trade-related infrastructure projects around the world. Two African leaders—Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn and Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta—were among the 29 world leaders invited to participate in the forum. On day one of the forum, Desalegn remarked, “We continue to view China as a successful economic model and reliable ally in the fight against poverty and in the quest for prosperity.” Notably, China completed an electrified rail project earlier this year that connects the Ethiopia capital Addis Ababa to Djibouti. On the sidelines of the forum, Kenyatta held talks with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang regarding infrastructure projects in Kenya and rebalancing trade with Africa more generally, which has become a deficit in recent years. While many, including Kenyatta, argue that improving infrastructure will help integrate Africa into regional and global trade networks and spur economic growth, critics warn that some countries are taking on too much Chinese debt in the process, which could ultimately jeopardize their economic and political sovereignty. Violence escalates in rural Central African Republic (CAR) On Wednesday, the Red Cross stated that its workers discovered 115 bodies in the Central African Republic town of Bangassou where, last Saturday, anti-Balaka armed men attacked the base of the U.N. mission in the CAR (MINUSCA). The armed men then attacked the Muslim neighborhood of Tokoyo. On Monday, violence erupted in the town of Bria, where Médecins Sans Frontières treated 24 wounded, and nearly 1,000 civilians were forced to seek refuge near the U.N. base. Last week, a three-day clash in the town of Alindao between anti-Balaka fighters and an ex-Séléka group killed 100 and displaced 8,500 people. The recent string of attacks have killed six U.N. peacekeepers, the deadliest attack on MINUSCA since its inception in 2014. United Nations spokespeople expressed “great alarm” over the spread of the fighting. Moreover, the organization has stated that the absence of violent fighting in the capital Bangui and other large cities in the CAR could be undermined by the recent increase in violence in rural areas. The U.N. plans to deploy more peacekeeping troops in response to the recent spike in violence. The Central African Republic has been marred by ethno-political conflict since 2013 when a coalition of mainly Muslim rebels (named Séléka) overthrew the government in March 2013. The group has since been dismantled but there remains a fraction of it, the ex Sélékas. They are now opposed by the majority Christian anti-Balaka militia. Côte d’Ivoire mutiny ends On Tuesday, May 16, soldiers in Côte d’Ivoire struck a deal with the government to end their four-day mutiny over bonus payments promised to end a similar mutiny in January. The government has already paid out 8,400 soldiers with 5 million CFA francs each ($8,400), but the collapse in the price of cocoa, the country’s main export, has put pressure on the government’s finances. The new deal promises an “immediate” bonus payment of 5 million CFA francs to 8,400 mutineers as well as another 2 million CFA francs to be paid at the end of June. Already, soldiers are returning to their barracks and have withdrawn from Bouake, the country’s second-largest city, which they had cut off from the rest of the country on Saturday. During the mutiny, renegade soldiers had also taken control of the national military headquarters and defense ministry in Abidjan. Sporadic gunfire was reported across the country, and NPR reports two deaths and nine wounded citizens. In line with a recent trend of regional activism, West African leaders called for peace and an end to the mutiny in Côte d’Ivoire. On Monday, on behalf of ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States), President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia issued a statement instructing the mutineers to end their campaign, stop the violence, and allow citizens to resume their normal activities. Nigerian Acting President Yemi Osinbajo similarly called for an end of the mutiny, discussing the issue with both Sirleaf and Ivorian President Alassane Outtara.

In September 2021, after 14 years of impactful partnership, Brookings and the Brookings Doha Center announced that they were ending their affiliation. The Brookings Doha Center is now the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, a separate public policy institution based in Qatar. Introduction As the United States slowly disengages from the Middle East, and as Europe faces internal challenges, a new actor is quietly exerting greater influence across North Africa. China has been strategically ramping up engagement with countries such as Egypt, Algeria, and Morocco, which lie at the intersection of three key regions: the Middle East, Africa, and the Mediterranean. Beijing’s growing footprint in these countries encompasses, but is not limited to, trade, infrastructure development, ports, shipping, financial cooperation, tourism, and manufacturing. Through this engagement, China is setting up North Africa to play an integral role in connecting Asia, Africa, and Europe — a key aim of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Previous analyses of the BRI’s role in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region have emphasized that the initiative is difficult to define, with its exact scope subject to much debate.1 While the current BRI map only officially includes Egypt, BRI Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) have been signed between China and every state in North Africa, demonstrating that it is expanding its foothold in the region. China is expanding its cooperation with North African countries, not only in the economic and cultural spheres, but also those of diplomacy and defense. Furthermore, it is showcasing a development model that seeks to combine authoritarianism with economic growth — a model that has an eager audience among regimes across the MENA region. As such, China’s growing role in North Africa is likely to have far-reaching economic and geopolitical consequences for countries in the region and around the world. This policy briefing seeks to analyze China’s growing role in North Africa. It will begin by providing background and context on China’s relations with Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya. Then, it will provide an overview of the soft and hard power elements of Chinese influence in North Africa, with a particular emphasis on soft power.2 Lastly, it will offer a set of policy recommendations aimed at North African, European, and U.S. policymakers. As part of these policy recommendations, this briefing argues that China’s engagement should be cautiously welcomed, but also closely monitored, by governments in North Africa, Europe, and the United States. North African governments should be wary of Chinese “debtbook diplomacy” and surveillance, while Western governments should be wary of the security consequences of an increased Chinese presence in the Mediterranean. Moving forward, China, North Africa, Europe, and the United States should seek win-win modalities of engagement that bring prosperity and stability to the Mediterranean basin. Background and Context China’s relationship with the countries of North Africa, especially Algeria and Egypt, began during the anticolonial struggle, stemming from an ideological support for national liberation movements. Notably, China was the first non-Arab country to recognize Algeria and provided political and military support for its revolutionary struggle. However, the basis of China’s interest in North Africa shifted away from “revolutionary romanticism,” and toward economic and strategic concerns, at the end of the twentieth century.3 In the wake of the 2008 recession and the Eurozone crisis, North African states, which have historically relied on trade and investment from Europe and the United States, worked to diversify their markets and economic partners.4 During the same period, China’s economy maintained impressive momentum, boasting a 9.5 percent GDP growth rate in 2011.5 Despite slower economic growth in recent years,6 China has promoted its economic and soft power through the BRI, which is the principle foreign policy initiative of the Xi Jinping era. Launched in 2013, this initiative is set to cost around $1 trillion, according to some estimates, and to include over 80 countries, which are responsible for around 36 percent of global GDP and 41 percent of global trade.7 South Asia has so far received the majority of BRI projects, but the initiative’s expansion west, toward Europe and the MENA region, is well underway. While China’s economic presence in Africa and Asia has been the subject of much study and scrutiny, the relationship between China and North Africa deserves more attention. This developing relationship reveals key trends and sheds light on China’s strategic priorities, as well as on how countries like Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt are increasing cooperation with new foreign partners. China engages in two main types of “partnership diplomacy” in the MENA region: strategic partnerships (SPs) and comprehensive strategic partnerships (CSPs).8 According to Strüver’s study of Chinese partnership diplomacy, relations between partner countries under an SP have the following four characteristics: - They go beyond typical diplomatic relations, involving consistent meetings between government officials and agencies to develop communication and trust. - They do not fall within the confines of treaty-based alliances or coalitions. - They are more ‘goal-driven’ than ‘threat-driven,’ typically focusing on areas of mutual cooperation in economics, culture, security, and technology. - They are characterized by an emphasis on behavior and institutional processes.9 In comparison with SPs, CSPs involve a higher level of institutional communication, including regular high-level meetings between top leadership members of both partner countries. Strüver notes that “Three conditions have to be met before an agreement on a… [CSP] can be achieved, i.e. political trust, dense economic ties, cultural exchanges, and good relations in other sectors.”10 As the table below illustrates, China has established CSPs with Algeria and Egypt and an SP with Morocco. These include dozens of MoUs and promises for major infrastructure and development projects. It is worth noting that, while China has signed BRI MoUs with Libya and Tunisia, it has yet to establish a formal partnership with either North African state.11China’s Partner Countries in the MENA region, 2012-July 201612 These partnerships demonstrate how China and North African states have strengthened their diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations in recent years, especially since the BRI was launched. Across the region, Chinese Cultural Centers and Confucius Institutes have been opened, while visa restrictions and travel advisories for Chinese tourists have been lifted, causing tourism to expand rapidly. Chinese diplomats at both the Rabat and Cairo embassies said that these strengthened relations reflect the key BRI aim of promoting connectivity and economic development in five priority areas: policy coordination, infrastructure connectivity, increased trade, financial integration, and people-to-people exchanges.13 China’s establishment of CSPs with both Egypt and Algeria reflects the major role these states play in the MENA region, as well as the fact that these are its two key bilateral relationships in the region in terms of trade, arms sales, and infrastructure projects. In turn, China has become the top trading partner for both Egypt and Algeria.14 Algeria is a major supplier of oil and gas to Europe, as well as a key economic and security actor in the Mediterranean, North African, and Sahel regions. It has the largest military budget in Africa, having spent $9.6 billion in 2018,15 and arguably acts as a leading “regional security provider.”16 Algeria has worked to mediate various regional conflicts, such as those in Mali and Libya, and has historically acted as a gateway to Africa, as well as to key regional blocs, such as the African Union. Meanwhile, Egypt controls one of the most strategic waterways in the world, the Suez Canal, and is becoming a major gas hub in the eastern Mediterranean.17 It also acts as another major regional security provider, managing one of the largest military forces in Africa.18 In addition, Egypt is allied with the Saudi-Emirati axis, which has sought to exert influence in Libya, Sudan, and elsewhere in the MENA region. While China’s relations with Egypt and Algeria are characterized by a robust diplomatic and security partnership, its growing presence in countries like Morocco and Tunisia remains primarily economic and cultural. In Libya, Chinese firms have ceased operations due to ongoing instability, though the prime minister of the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA), Fayez Serraj, has said that they are welcome to return.19 Overall, the strategic location of these five countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean means that China’s presence will only continue to expand, especially in the economic realm. Notably, China’s relations with these countries are framed by its official policy of non-interference in political affairs, in contrast to the policies of historical Western partners. Likewise, these five countries, to varying extents, increasingly view China as a viable alternative partner to Europe and the United States, leading them to expand their cooperation with Beijing, not only on economic and cultural matters, but also on diplomacy and defense issues. Soft Power: Economic and Cultural Pillars Chinese policy in North Africa combines both soft power and hard power elements, but soft power has been particularly prominent in Chinese discourse.20 While many types of economic power are understood to be forms of hard power, China engages in a softer form of economic influence, using economic diplomacy “more as carrots than as sticks.”21 The commercial side of Chinese influence in North Africa is directly related to the growing legitimacy of the Chinese development model, which emphasizes economic development and non-interference in political affairs, in contrast to the traditional Western emphasis on advocating for liberal and democratic norms. In line with these observations, this paper defines soft power to include economic and commercial relations, based on an understanding of how China uses trade, investment, and finance as noncoercive tools in its relations with North African countries. Currently, most BRI engagement in North Africa is tied to economic and commercial relations, giving the involved countries the opportunity to increase trade volumes, foreign investments, tourism revenues, and the number of manufacturing bases. This has also had the effect of encouraging competition among traditional Western partners, such as the European Union,22as well as China and Russia. Chinese diplomats stress that North African countries are especially attractive prospects for economic cooperation due to their proximity to European, African, and Asian markets, high number of industrial zones, and high levels of investment in infrastructure development.23Trade From Morocco to Egypt, China is increasingly trading with and investing in North African countries. Its economic strategies differ from country to country, with Egypt, Morocco, and Algeria representing its highest priorities. According to the Egyptian Ministry of Trade and Industry, Egypt is China’s third largest trading partner in Africa.24 In 2017, the trade volume between the two countries reached $10.87 billion,25 while the value of Egypt’s imports from China was over $8 billion, the highest in North Africa.26 In the first eight months of 2018, bilateral trade between Egypt and China jumped by around 26 percent.27 China’s trade with Morocco is more modest, but is gradually expanding; Morocco’s imports from China were worth $3.14 billion in 2017, behind",2013-2017,18,high_conflict
23,2013,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/china-india-relations-millennia-of-peaceful-coexistence-meet-modern-day-geopolitical-interests/,en,"Content from the Brookings Doha Center is now archived. In September 2021, after 14 years of impactful partnership, Brookings and the Brookings Doha Center announced that they were ending their affiliation. The Brookings Doha Center is now the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, a separate public policy institution based in Qatar. The China-India dispute over the Doklam plateau and the two states’ subsequent fence-mending at the BRICS summit have brought into focus what will be one of the most important relationships in the future world order. While the last half-century has seen antagonism between India and China, in the context of thousands of years of civilizational cultural exchange, it is an anomaly resulting from strategic and economic interests. Cultivating awareness of this history amongst the publics of each country may provide one small step toward mitigating tensions, in contexts where policymakers wish to do so. Chinese philosopher-diplomat Hu Shih once said that India conquered China culturally for 20 centuries without ever sending a soldier across its border; the statement is often taken to highlight the rich history of cultural ties between the two civilizations, rather than any nationalistic superiority. For millennia, India and China shared deep cultural norms, primarily through Buddhism, which shaped both societies in unique ways. Post-independence, this long history of peaceful cultural exchange manifested, via a conscious political effort, into a sense of bilateral solidarity, as seen in the Panchsheel Treaty. This solidarity, however, was largely concentrated amongst foreign policy and political elites, without corresponding dispersion amongst the Indian and Chinese publics. Drivers of Cooperation Even today, there are significant forces pushing for peace and cooperation between Beijing and New Delhi. The growing economic relationship has in some respects acted as an anchor preventing strategic relations veering too far into negative territory. For instance, China is India’s largest trading partner. Globally, the two have some converging interests as fellow rising developing countries. They seek fairer terms of trade. They call for a greater say in the running of global institutions, including economic institutions in which they share a degree of skepticism of neoliberal ideology. And, while maintaining differing visions of it, both China and India hold a preference for a multipolar world order. Drivers of Conflict Nevertheless, relations are strained by several factors which fuel the potential for conflict. Economic relations have been some cause for rivalry, including India’s large trade deficit with China, disputes over market access, and resource competition. The recent Doklam clash is the result of lingering disputes over the border whose antecedents date back to the colonial era. These boiled over into war in 1962 when China launched offensives in Ladakh, simultaneously shattering bilateral peace and first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s idealism. Beyond individual disputes, India sees China as its main external threat. This is clear in the fact that India’s nuclear weapons program was largely aimed at defending against China, more than against Pakistan. In the eyes of Indian policymakers today, Beijing’s increasing strategic dominance in Asia and beyond represents an unknown force that may impinge on its own rise. This is in contrast to U.S. primacy in the region, which despite past rivalries, is a now considered known force; one that has facilitated the generally stable environment that enabled India’s economic growth since the 1990s. This has contributed to India’s support for U.S. positions on matters like freedom of navigation. Furthermore, Delhi has long sought to deny external powers access to the South Asian region. China’s long-time partnership with Pakistan is an affront to this, including the Belt and Road Initiative’s (BRI) China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. India seeks to convince others, e.g. Sri Lanka, to halt or reduce Beijing’s strategic footprint in their territories, including through warning of the debt burden BRI could create for them. Additionally, Delhi has sought to build its own relationships with China’s neighbors, who seek more leverage in their dealings with Beijing, particularly Japan. India cooperated with Vietnam in exploring for minerals in the South China Sea and took steps toward selling Brahmos missiles to the country. For its part, for many decades China saw India as more of an annoyance than a threat and today, as a somewhat “conditional” threat. Primarily, Delhi will be problematic to Beijing’s strategic agenda if, and to the degree that, India cooperates with any U.S. efforts to contain China. In particular, Beijing fears its trade routes being cut off in the event of a conflict with Washington. India could play a pivotal role given its strategic location in the Indian Ocean, between China and its Middle Eastern energy sources, African resource reserves, and European markets. These fears, combined with China’s support for Pakistan, have contributed to Beijing opposing Delhi on key strategic and symbolic matters like India’s ambitions for permanent membership of the U.N. Security Council and its joining of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. That said, Chinese policymakers do not view an anti-China, Indo-U.S. alliance as a foregone conclusion. The direction of Beijing’s messaging in regard to disputes suggests that it sees India as a target for diplomatic persuasion and pressure, rather than a solidified strategic rival. At the BRICS summit, President Xi Jinping made a distinctly complimentary speech regarding India, and even allowed mention of Pakistan-based terror groups in the BRICS statement. Why then did Beijing build a road in Doklam and trigger India’s ire? It may have been a testing exercise, similar to that which China has employed in other disputed territories like the South China Sea and East China Sea; pushing the boundaries to learn how neighbors react, and to what extent the United States becomes involved. In resolving the dispute, the leadership in Beijing was required to balance the domestic political necessity of seeming “tough,” with its interest in not pushing Delhi too far toward Washington. The fact that China’s decision to halt road-building occurred just prior to the BRICS summit in its city of Xiamen highlights the importance Beijing places on being seen as a benevolent power and future global leader, with BRICS as a key vehicle. Harnessing Historical Awareness Both countries’ overarching ambition—to rise in international standing—is underpinned by attributes that are common to the two countries. This includes a relatively high degree of historical awareness held by policymakers and the public, including both ideas of a “great pre-colonial past” and of colonial humiliation. Both states have more civilizational continuity than other major global powers. The dominant cultures and identities of India and China have undergone less transformation than other great civilizations of the Mediterranean and Middle East. The two societies maintain the value of hierarchy and are led by foreign policy elites that have ingested these values into their geopolitical worldviews and policymaking. On the one hand, these common attributes make reconciliation difficult, as issues of territory and sovereignty have added sensitivity. On the other hand, focusing this awareness on the past millennia of peaceful coexistence and cultural exchange can assist policymakers in both countries to reduce the domestic political incentives for antagonism, on occasions where they seek to do so. Of course, to alter public perceptions, policymakers would need to reorient the post-independence Panchsheel era’s top-down approach, and make concerted attempts to engage ordinary people. If the Indian public viewed China in a broader context that includes linkages like China’s adoption of Indian Buddhism, rather than exclusively focusing on present-day sources of antagonism like Sino-Pakistan ties, it could provide leaders in Delhi greater room to maneuver on matters like the border dispute. Modi himself has opted to emphasize ties via Buddhism and Hinduism in his outreach to Southeast Asia and South Asia. To highlight cultural ties to the other country’s publics, Delhi and Beijing could deploy various soft power tools including: educational exchange, social media, traditional media, tourism, and greater resourcing of public diplomacy centers like the Nehru Centers and Confucius Institutes. Of course the overriding power of divergent geopolitical interests may mean the risk of conflict will remain in the medium term. Nevertheless, making efforts in the aforementioned directions may present at least one avenue for greater trust in one of the 21st centuries most important relationships.

24,2013,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/chinas-one-belt-one-road-initiative-a-view-from-the-united-states/,en,"This piece originally appeared in The ASAN Forum on June 19, 2017. On May 4, the United States announced the conclusion of a US-China trade deal. There is some good news in terms of immediate new market access for US beef exports as well as commitments by China that its domestic regulatory agencies will consider providing the licenses and patents that are needed to ensure market access for US financial services and biotech products. Included in the agreement was a major concession: US recognition of the importance of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a move that will likely be seen as signaling acceptance of one of the initiative’s underlying strategic aims—to secure a greater leadership role for China in Asia. This development comes at a time of heightened uncertainty in Asia over the US administration’s commitment to the region in light of President Donald Trump’s decision to pull it out of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP)—a 12-nation trade agreement. Outcomes from the US-China Trade Agreement The US-China trade deal is not a trade agreement in the sense this term is normally used. Unlike a free trade agreement, it is not legally binding, nor does it include a mechanism for settling disputes should either side fail to implement the agreement. On substance, the agreement only addresses limited specific market access issues. This contrasts with the comprehensive nature of US FTAs, which tend to cover close to 100 percent of trade. The deal is instead a political agreement: it addresses a subset of US-China trade issues and is an outgrowth of the 100-day plan to improve trade ties to which Trump and President Xi Jinping agreed at their April summit. The trade agreement provides for firm deadlines to allow imports of US beef and to make regulatory decisions concerning access to China’s electronic payments market, biotech products, and ratings agencies. For its part, the United States agreed to improve China’s access to US exports of liquefied natural gas and to allow imports of cooked chicken from China. The Belt and Road Initiative Launched by Xi in 2013, the BRI envisions the construction of road and sea connections between China and countries in Southeast Asia, Central Asia and through to Europe. This is to be achieved with massive investment in infrastructure, including roads, rail, airports, ports, pipelines, and communications. China has committed $1.4 trillion to the initiative, which will leverage multiples of private finance to foot the bill for building and servicing the infrastructure. Credit Suisse estimates that China could invest over $500 billion into 62 BRI projects over the next 5 years. However, current Chinese overseas lending and investment continues to chase commercial returns globally instead of being focused largely on funding the BRI projects.1 Once completed, the BRI could cover over 4.4 billion people and generate a Gross Domestic Product of over $21 trillion.2 The Reasons for Belt and Road Initiative The national significance of BRI needs to be understood in the context of changes in China’s foreign policy orientation. In particular, Xi’s articulation of the “China Dream” is of a rejuvenated nation that is internally prosperous as well as more internationally engaged. In this respect, Xi’s drive appears to be supplanting Deng Xiaoping’s maxim that the country should bide its time and maintain a low profile with a more explicitly outward looking foreign policy, which, in ambition at least, seeks to reflect China’s view of itself as becoming Asia’s dominant power.3 The BRI encompasses several strategic and economic goals. One is to use infrastructure as a means of projecting and building regional influence. Building infrastructure at scale is something that China has demonstrated it can do. Infrastructure megaprojects, whether at home or overseas, create strong visual statements that support a narrative of economic progress. Such a focus can also help address global infrastructure needs and tackle the need for sustainable infrastructure as part of the drive to address climate change.4BRI is also an important part of Chinese trade and investment initiatives that seek to advance regional economic integration and promote greater economic reliance on China.5BRI infrastructure will create more efficient trade links within China and throughout Asia. Its projects can also be used to export Chinese standards—such as for high-speed rail, which could further lock in preferences for Chinese exports in the region. The impact of BRI on regional trade integration should also be seen in light of trade agreements such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP) involving the ASEAN + 6 countries (China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, New Zealand). Once completed, RCEP will also provide preferential access to each country’s markets. BRI could help China address some of its excess capacity in industries such as steel and cement, since infrastructure projects supported by the initiative would boost external demand for Chinese exports. The initiative could provide a means for Chinese industries with excess capacity to export equipment that is currently idle. From this perspective, BRI is in part a response to the structural challenges that afflict China’s growth model—reliance on state-owned enterprise (SOEs) and state subsidized finance that has led to over-investment and an undeveloped services sector.6 In this regard, BRI allows China to double-down on its growth model by finding new markets where it can continue doing more of the same—building infrastructure using SOEs and state finance. In this way, BRI risks exporting the weaknesses in China’s economic growth model throughout the region. That BRI is both a political and economic agenda of Xi means that some infrastructure projects may lack a strong economic rationale. However, it would be wrong to assume that BRI will necessarily fail due to a lack of commercial logic. Xi’s commitment means that, for the foreseeable future, it will move forward. China’s use of SOEs and state banks such as the China Development Bank means that the state can absorb these losses—likely justified as the cost of achieving BRI’s longer term economic and strategic goals.7 However, Moody’s recent downgrading of China’s credit rating highlights systemic risks for China with respect to further credit growth, particularly if directed for political reasons into non-performing loans for BRI projects. Some projects will also support China’s ability to project military strength in the region. For instance, the development of the Port of Gwadar in Pakistan will give China access to the Indian Ocean for commercial purposes and could serve as a deep-water port for its navy. Whatever the final outcome of BRI, the initiative is already having an impact on the evolving narratives in Asia regarding the respective roles of China and the United States. BRI provides scope for win-win outcomes by addressing infrastructure gaps, improving trade flows, and spurring economic growth, from all of which US businesses may potentially benefit. Yet, there is also a fundamental competitive tension around the question of whether China or the United States will ultimately determine the rules for trade and investment in the region. One Belt One Road in the Absence of US Participation in TPP Supported by President G.W. Bush and finalized by President Obama, TPP formed a core part of America’s effort to update and expand rules for trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific. Trump withdrew the United States from TPP on his first day in office. The Obama administration made clear that the goals for it were to expand trade and investment with countries in the Asia-Pacific and to develop regional rules centered around US leadership.8 A TPP inclusive of the United States would have buttressed America’s broader diplomatic and military rebalancing towards Asia by supporting the economic development of allies and reaffirming America’s commitment to the region. And the impact of the TPP would have been magnified as more countries joined. In important respects, a TPP that included the United States would have supported countries in the region that want to ensure that BRI happens in ways that minimize economic risks and limit its strategic heft. For instance, even in the absence of China’s participation in TPP, the agreements’ rules disciplining how SOEs compete domestically and overseas created a legal baseline that countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia could have applied to Chinese SOEs as they invested in BRI projects. Moreover, by providing preferential access to the US market, the TPP offered the prospect of stabilizing and potentially growing these countries’ trade with the United States, where China had in recent years become their number one market. Providing these countries with another avenue for growth in trade and investment would have created more strategic space for TPP parties to push back and demand that BRI projects only proceed in ways consistent with their best interests. Instead, while BRI was in part China’s response to the TPP, following Trump’s withdrawal, it has become a key initiative for expanding China’s trade and investment across the region. Having withdrawn from TPP, the US administration has failed to articulate a trade and investment agenda for Asia that can compare to the TPP or China’s ambition for BRI. Its Asia trade policy has now been reduced to a possible bilateral FTA with Japan, which, even if it gets off the ground, will take years to conclude and will have none of the regional rule building and norm setting characteristics of the TPP. Conclusion Trump’s TPP pullout has significant economic and strategic consequences for the United States, none of which are good. It is an own goal that is more consistent with “US last” than Trump’s “US first” claims. The decision by the administration to recognize the BRI in the US-China trade agreement would, in the presence of TPP, have been a pragmatic move to make space for a personal initiative of Xi, recognizing the win-win nature of the trade liberalization brought about by TPP and BRI’s goals of investing in needed infrastructure. With TPP on shaky ground at best, this recognition of BRI compounds the uncertainty in Asia caused by the US withdrawal and raises further questions about US economic and strategic goals for the region. - Footnotes - David Dollar, “Yes, China is investing globally – but not so much in its one belt one road initiative”, Brookings Order from Chaos Blog, May 8, 2017. - Executive Summary from the Inaugural Belt and Road Summit, Hong Kong, 18 May 2016. - Christopher K.

25,2013,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/future-development-reads-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative/,en,"If you’re like me and my colleagues here at Duke University, you don’t know what to make of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI is the new acronym, the old one was OBOR for One Belt One Road). Is it just a way for China to put its excess construction workforce, steel and cement production, and burgeoning bank balances to work, or is it the first part of a grand plan to take over the role of hegemon? Is it both, or something else? I’m going to recommend some readings that might help you make up your mind. Though it was launched in 2013, these are early days for BRI, and much of what’s out there is journalistic stuff. So don’t expect rigorous analysis. But I plan to use this blog to keep readers informed about the BRI, and you can expect reads that are progressively more serious. Figure 1: The Belt (red) and the Road (blue) What is the Belt and Road Initiative? This is the official explanation by China’s National Development and Reform Commission, the lead agency for the BRI. This article by Geoff Wade provides a crisp summary of the initiative, calling it “a Chinese economic and strategic agenda by which the two ends of Eurasia, as well as Africa and Oceania, are being more closely tied along two routes—one overland and one maritime.” While it formally covers greater development cooperation, infrastructure networks, trade, financial cooperation, and cultural exchanges, infrastructure is getting all of the attention. More than 65 countries have signed on. This article has a map that shows the members of the BRI: essentially every country in Asia and East and Central Europe, except for Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. Participant countries have more than half the world’s population and about a third of global GDP. Annual investments of about $150 billion are envisaged for the next decade. At the Belt and Road Forum in May, China pledged about $125 billion in financing. China is putting a lot of money into the BRI. In 2016 China reportedly made about $30 billion of acquisitions in BRI countries; this year, it has already made more than that. This is at a time when the government has been discouraging offshore acquisitions by Chinese firms. Regulators have obviously been told to prioritize BRI investments. The BRI is not to be confused with the China-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. David Dollar explains the difference. The AIIB was launched in 2016 and has 56 member countries (Australia, New Zealand and South Korea are members). The AIIB is just one of the financial institutions funding investments that are part of the BRI. The Heritage Foundation advises U.S. policymakers to watch out. Developments in Central Asia are especially telling: China’s trade with the five Central Asian states (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) is already more than double their trade with Russia. What does China expect to get out of it? The Economist explains what’s in it for China. “Its ultimate aim is to make Eurasia (dominated by China) an economic and trading area to rival the transatlantic one (dominated by America). Behind this broad strategic imperative lie a plethora of secondary motivations…. By investing in infrastructure, Mr. Xi hopes to find a more profitable home for China’s vast foreign-exchange reserves, most of which are in low-interest-bearing American government securities. He also hopes to create new markets for Chinese companies, such as high-speed rail firms, and to export some of his country’s vast excess capacity in cement, steel, and other metals. By investing in volatile countries in central Asia, he reckons he can create a more stable neighborhood for China’s own restive western provinces of Xinjiang and Tibet. And by encouraging more Chinese projects around the South China Sea, the initiative could bolster China’s claims in that area (the “road” in “belt and road” refers to sea lanes).” David Dollar explains why China considers it urgent. In the six years before the financial crisis, the Chinese economy was growing at 11 percent each year with an investment to GDP ratio of just over 40 percent. In the six years after the crisis, the growth rate has averaged 7 percent with an investment-to-GDP ratio of 50 percent. The Chinese are justified in finding ways to grow more efficiently, and the BRI should be seen as the external component of the strategy; the domestic agenda is equally complex. What should others do to make the most of the initiative? About a year ago, the Economist Intelligence Unit provided what I thought was the most comprehensive country-by-country list of activities that could be included in the BRI. It is mostly about infrastructure. What should get a lot more attention are the social, environmental, and political implications of the BRI for the countries that benefit from greater infrastructure investments and increased road, rail, and sea traffic.

26,2013,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/grading-chinas-belt-and-road/,en,"April 08, 2019 Grading China's Belt and Road This report has also been adapted as a pamphlet and slide deck. Read translated versions of the report's executive summary in French, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Urdu, Arabic, Czech, Burmese, and Polish. Executive Summary Since its launch in 2013, what China calls “One Belt, One Road” has emerged as the corner-stone of Beijing’s economic statecraft. Under the umbrella of the Belt and Road, Beijing seeks to promote a more connected world brought together by a web of Chinese-funded physical and digital infrastructure. The infrastructure needs in Asia and beyond are significant, but the Belt and Road is more than just an economic initiative; it is a central tool for advancing China’s geo-political ambitions. Through the economic activities bundled under the Belt and Road, Beijing is pursuing a vision of the 21st century defined by great power spheres of influence, state-directed economic interactions, and creeping authoritarianism.1 As Beijing prepares to host the second Belt and Road Forum in late April 2019, countries that once welcomed Chinese investment have become increasingly vocal about the downsides. This report is intended to serve as a resource for governments, corporations, journalists, and civil society groups now re-evaluating the costs and benefits of Belt and Road projects. Building on previous research by the Center for a New American Security and other institutions,2 this report provides a high-level overview of the primary challenges associated with China’s Belt and Road. It explores these challenges in the context of 10 cases that have received little high-profile attention and identifies future concerns generated by the Belt and Road’s growing digital focus. Lastly, the report puts forward a checklist for evaluating future infrastructure projects involving China. Seven Challenges Created by Chinese Investment Although not monolithic, Chinese infrastructure projects feature a number of common challenges for recipient states. These challenges include: - Erosion of national sovereignty: Beijing has obtained control over select infrastructure projects through equity arrangements, long-term leases, or multi-decade operating contracts. - Lack of transparency: Many projects feature opaque bidding processes for contracts and financial terms that are not subject to public scrutiny. - Unsustainable financial burdens: Chinese lending to some countries has increased their risk of debt default or repayment difficulties, while certain completed projects have not generated sufficient revenue to justify the cost. - Disengagement from local economic needs: Belt and Road projects often involve the use of Chinese firms and labor for construction, which does little to transfer skills to local workers, and sometimes involve inequitable profit-sharing arrangements. - Geopolitical risks: Some infrastructure projects financed, built, or operated by China can compromise the recipient state’s telecommunications infrastructure or place the country at the center of strategic competition between Beijing and other great powers. - Negative environmental impacts: Belt and Road projects in some instances have proceeded without adequate environmental assessments or have caused severe environmental damage. - Significant potential for corruption: In countries that already have a high level of kleptocracy, Belt and Road projects have involved payoffs to politicians and bureaucrats. These challenges associated with China’s Belt and Road are not limited to a particular region or type of infrastructure project. A survey of 10 lesser-known Chinese projects across the globe shows that all feature three or more of these challenges. Chinese Infrastructure Projects: A Global Snapshot Looking Forward Due to these challenges, the Belt and Road has provoked growing international resistance, most acutely in the Indo-Pacific. This rising backlash has not gone unnoticed in Beijing.3 Yet it is unlikely that China’s approach will fundamentally change in the years ahead. The sheer size of ongoing Belt and Road projects limits China’s ability to refocus on smaller and less controversial efforts. Moreover, the Belt and Road is ultimately a vehicle for China’s geopolitical ambitions. Liabilities for host countries – loss of control, opacity, debt, dual-use potential, and corruption – are often strategic assets for Beijing. The primary adaptation of the Belt and Road will be its growing focus on the digital domain. This emphasis on information connectivity will serve to export elements of China’s high-technology domestic surveillance regime, as well as further expose recipient states to possible information compromise. The first five years of the Belt and Road provide ample evidence of the types of projects that countries should avoid. It is imperative that governments, companies, journalists, and civil society groups possess a shared framework for assessing the costs and benefits of future infrastructure projects involving China. The following checklist – the inverse of the seven challenges outlined above – provides an initial starting point. Projects proposed by Beijing that check each box merit serious consideration; those that leave one or more boxes empty require close scrutiny.

27,2013,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/is-chinas-development-finance-a-challenge-to-the-international-order/,en,"This paper was presented at the Japan Center for Economic Research (JCER) conference in Tokyo, October 2017. All the conference papers are available here. China in recent years has become a major funder of infrastructure in the developing world. The big Chinese financing push started shortly after the global financial crisis (GFC). Starting in 2013 China “branded” the program under the rubric of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). In speeches in Kazakhstan and Indonesia, President Xi Jinping proposed the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. The former refers to the ancient overland Silk Road between China and Europe. The latter is a vaguer concept that in practice seems to incorporate the whole world. The BRI involves issues such as policy coordination and harmonization of standards, but at its heart is infrastructure financing. In his opening remarks at the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing in May 2017 President Xi noted that: “Infrastructure connectivity is the foundation of development through cooperation. We should promote land, maritime, air and cyberspace connectivity, concentrate our efforts on key passageways, cities and projects and connect networks of highways, railways and sea ports.” The initiative has been met with enthusiasm by many developing countries, who see new opportunities for financing needed infrastructure. Some nearby countries such as India, on the other hand, have reacted with caution as they question China’s strategic motivations. Developed countries of the West have also been reticent to endorse the program until they learn more about the details. A concern of Western countries is that China’s efforts will undermine global norms, especially in the areas of debt sustainability and environmental and social safeguards. This paper examines China’s role in development finance and in particular addresses the issue of whether China is challenging global norms. China’s effort is recent and data problems are legion. Given that the initiative is popular in many locations it is odd that China is so secretive about the lending amounts, terms, and specific projects funded. Most of the lending is coming from two big state-owned policy banks, China Development Bank and China EXIM Bank. It would be straight-forward for them to publish up-to-date data on lending to different countries, including the terms. In the absence of that kind of transparency, researchers have to make heroic efforts to compile their best estimates. The paper uses recently published AidData to paint a picture of the scale of Chinese financing and where it goes in terms of countries and sectors. Total lending to developing countries appears to be about $40 billion per year in the recent period, an amount that is significant and consistent with China’s overall balance of payments. Geographically, the lending is not particularly targeted to the belt and road; much of it is going to Africa and Latin America. Also, the lending is uncorrelated with measures of risk such as political stability or rule of law. The paper also takes up the issue of debt sustainability. The countries receiving significant finance from China vary significantly in the quality of economic governance. Some have very good governance, and some, quite poor. Not surprisingly, some of the countries with poor governance are beginning to have problems servicing their external debts. This raises some important questions of global governance: will the troubled countries go to the IMF, as has been the practice in the past? Will China change its behavior as recipient country debt reaches unsustainable levels? Another important global issue is environmental and social safeguards in infrastructure projects. Most large projects have environmental risks and involve resettlement of communities. The multilateral development banks (MDBs) have developed through experience a set of rules and procedures for assessing and mitigating risks. Many client countries, however, find these procedures cumbersome and extra-legal. It is a fact that the MDBs have become very slow in the construction of infrastructure, and the clients had turned away from this source of finance even before China came on the scene. China’s approach is to follow the laws and regulations of the country in which it is operating, which is a reasonable position. However, in some countries with poor governance regulations are mostly honored in the breech. How is the Chinese approach playing out on the ground? And is there evidence of any shift in the Chinese approach? Most of the action up to now has come from CDB and EXIM. An interesting recent development is the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a Chinese-led MDB that has quickly attracted 56 member countries. In two years of operation AIIB has lent about $3 billion, a very small share of China’s development finance; and three-quarters of the projects have been co-financed with the other MDBs. AIIB’s lending will grow over time, however, and has the potential to directly and indirectly address some of the concerns about Chinese practices. The bottom line: It is too early to make a definitive judgment on whether China’s finance is a challenge to the global economic order. There are certainly things to worry about such as growing indebtedness of some of China’s big clients and environmental and social safeguards on the ground. But there are also signs of evolution. China stopped new funding for Venezuela, which is the most problematic of its major clients. Several of the major borrowers from China have turned to IMF programs, which is the traditional medicine for unsustainable debt. Chinese companies and lenders have been given voluntary environmental and social standards by the Ministry of Commerce, which is a step in the right direction. Most encouraging, AIIB is off to a good start and may bring about improvements in the operation of the whole MDB system. The Brookings Institution is committed to quality, independence, and impact.

28,2013,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/one-year-on-the-role-of-the-china-international-development-cooperation-administration-remains-cloudy/,en,"Just one year ago, on April 18, 2018, China formally established its first independent foreign aid agency: the China International Development Cooperation Administration (CIDCA). Attention from top leadership attested to the importance of this new agency: The opening ceremony was chaired by Politburo member Yang Jiechi and attended by State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the two most senior foreign policy officials of China. The establishment of CIDCA addresses a long debate in China about its foreign aid reform and the creation of an independent aid agency. However, one year into its creation, has CIDCA begun to make a difference? An examination of its mandate and setup reveals a genuine effort by China to reform and improve its aid practices. However, a scrutiny of the foreign aid budget allocation suggests that CIDCA will have a long way to go to take full charge, if it ever will. CIDCA might have become the face of China’s foreign aid for the foreign audience, and it might participate extensively in the coordination of aid decisions; however, the internal bureaucracy dictates that money, hence the authority, still lies elsewhere. Long desired aid reform coming to fruition The creation of CIDCA originates from a long debate around which national interests China’s foreign aid should prioritize and, therefore, which government agency should manage the aid portfolio. Before CIDCA, the administrative office of China’s foreign aid sat within the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) as the Department of Foreign Aid, a director-general-level institution. With this bureaucratic design, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) was discontent, as aid decisions were believed to have skewed toward commercial interests rather than toward the broader strategic interests of China. The fact that the majority of Chinese aid has been used for concessional loans seems to support this argument. In its 2014 Foreign Aid White Paper, China acknowledged that 55.7 percent of its foreign aid between 2010 and 2012 had been used for concessional loans. The bureaucratic setup of the new CIDCA seems to be a continuity of the country’s commercial focus towards foreign aid. The bureaucratic ranking of CIDCA is set at the vice-ministerial level. The director, Wang Xiaotao, was the former deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top economic policymaking organ. The first two deputy directors of CIDCA came from MOFCOM and the MFA, respectively, reflecting the two pillars China’s foreign aid has been and continues to be anchored on. In particular, Deputy Director Zhou Liujun used to be in charge of service trade and foreign direct investment at MOFCOM. In comparison, the deputy director from the MFA, Deng Boqing, was Chinese ambassador to Nigeria. In early 2019, a third deputy director—former deputy director of the National Intellectual Property Administration, Zhang Maoyu—was added to CIDCA’s leadership, which suggests an emphasis on intellectual property issues within the framework of China’s foreign aid. Mandates: The old and the new CIDCA’s mission statement suggests subtle yet important distinctions in its mandate and authority in comparison with its previous incarnation as the Department of Foreign Aid at MOFCOM. Instead of the implementation of specific projects, CIDCA is geared more toward the strategic design, management, and interagency coordination of China’s foreign aid administration. For example, the 2018 Draft Foreign Aid Management Methods identified new tasks for CIDCA including strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation, aid reform, and budget preparation. Another key distinction lies in the concrete project implementation side: Although CIDCA is responsible for the planning and coordination of foreign aid, it is not responsible for their implementation. The implementation will remain the responsibility of the individual relevant functional agencies, such as the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Agriculture. Furthermore, CIDCA is responsible for developing country strategies and signing aid projects as the face of China’s foreign aid. In the “Cooperation Activities” section of CIDCA’s website, seven bilateral cooperation agreements were listed between June and December of 2018 where CIDCA signed economic development agreements on behalf of China. CIDCA has already had active engagement with multilateral institutions such as the United Nations and World Bank, as well as traditional donors such as the U.K., EU, Australia, and Norway. Foreign aid budget: NOT under CIDCA’s control The creation of CIDCA raises the question of the structure of decisionmaking and budget allocation, which determines the center of gravity of China’s foreign aid. Indeed, if CIDCA doesn’t control the money, its control of the aid decisions will be subject to serious constraints. Most importantly, China’s concessional loans, which make up the majority of its foreign aid, are traditionally managed by the China Export-Import Bank. As of now, there is no definitive answer to this question, as many issues related to CIDCA’s operation are still in flux within the Chinese bureaucracy. However, numbers do not lie, and the budget allocation among government agencies offers the best assessment. According to the 2019 CIDCA budget, the total foreign aid budget under CIDCA for 2019 is 122 million RMB (about $18 million), up from 105 million RMB ($15 million) in 2018. In 2018, there was no budget allocated for international development cooperation, but in 2019 this budget line increased to 74 million RMB ($11 million). CIDCA’s explanation for this increase is its adjustment of the budget previously listed under trade and commercial affairs, now under international development cooperation. The combined total of these two budget lines, termed “foreign affairs expenses,” are 197 million RMB (around $29 million). These numbers come as a shock given how tiny they are. The 2014 Foreign Aid White Paper disclosed that China’s foreign aid from 2010 to 2012 was 89.3 billion RMB—around 30 billion RMB ($4.6 billion), per year. We can only assume that China’s total foreign aid has, in fact, increased since then, especially under the Belt and Road Initiative launched in 2013. The tiny budget CIDCA gets vis-à-vis China’s much larger foreign aid spending can point to only one possibility: that the bulk of China’s foreign aid budget is parked and managed somewhere beyond CIDCA. Where is the bulk of the foreign aid budget? The 2019 MOFCOM budget brings the answer. Although CIDCA is established as China’s aid agency, the foreign aid budget of MOFCOM in 2019 is as high as 17.6 billion RMB, around $2.63 billion, which is more in line with China’s annual foreign aid spending. Although nominally MOFCOM should be transferring the foreign aid portfolio to CIDCA, its foreign aid budget in fact has increased by 6.53 percent since 2018, when the transition supposedly began. MOFCOM might eventually transfer the authority and budget to CIDCA. However, the fact that CIDCA’s foreign aid budget is 1 percent that of MOFCOM in 2019 raises serious questions that the aid authorities, especially those on specific projects are not under CIDCA’s purview. Implications for Africa CIDCA represents a long-desired evolution of China’s foreign aid practice. The emphasis on strategic planning, interagency coordination, monitoring, and evaluation reflect efforts and progress in modernizing China’s foreign aid, its pursuit of better practice, as well as engagement with traditional donors. In the long run, better practice of Chinese foreign aid projects is supposed to contribute to Africa’s social and economic development. The familiarization with the norms and standards of the field will also bring opportunities for donor cooperation and coordination between China and the traditional donors. These could potentially all be good news for Africa. However, Africa should also understand that the establishment of CIDCA does not indicate a total abandonment of China’s current aid practice and the majority of the aid projects and their budget are still being made at MOFCOM. CIDCA is one additional player with whom Africa will need to learn to deal and navigate bureaucratic politics. The Brookings Institution is committed to quality, independence, and impact.

29,2013,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/protect-the-party-chinas-growing-influence-in-the-developing-world/,en,"Introduction As China’s growing global role and increasingly hardline policies at home and abroad gain attention, the United States and other Western governments are also taking notice of China’s expanding influence in developing countries. The implications of China’s growing investments linked to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), its ambitious global infrastructure and connectivity program, are increasingly debated. So, too, are the nature of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) efforts to popularize its authoritarian model and undermine developing democracies around the world, whether intentionally or indirectly.1 In November, Vice President Pence noted that the administration, through its Indo-Pacific strategy, intends to bolster the rule of law and human rights in regional countries facing growing influence from China. Such attention is welcome, and it has spurred numerous analyses on the drivers of China’s growing influence efforts, with most focused on external factors in Beijing’s calculus. China seeks influence due to many geostrategic considerations, such as the protection of sea lanes critical for the transport of energy and the establishment of military facilities to protect China’s growing global interests. However, much of the foundation for China’s growing influence in developing countries is found inside China, where the CCP faces a mounting set of challenges to its rule that dominate its attention. As Washington considers how best to address China’s push for influence across the developing world, it is critical to have a clear understanding of the domestic imperatives at play. Studies addressing internal drivers of China’s growing influence abroad have centered on the implications of President Xi Jinping’s consolidation of power since late 2012. Indeed, as others note in this series, it is tempting to ascribe the aggressive turn in Chinese foreign policy entirely to Xi, who has brought China closer to one-man rule than it has been in decades. Xi has centralized power across all policy domains, including foreign affairs.2 Xi has used this power at the apex of foreign policymaking to accelerate China’s push for influence in the developing world. Xi’s centralization of power, however, has been more an accelerant than the main driver of China’s more assertive influence efforts. It is, rather, the Party’s obsession with preserving its rule—a theme which both predated and facilitated Xi’s elevation to power in 2012—that more fundamentally drives China’s growing influence in developing countries. Mounting threats to CCP control have occupied Chinese leaders since early this century as they have come to terms with the unraveling of the core factors that characterized China’s reform era—relative political stability, ideological openness, and rapid economic growth. As Carl Minzner puts it, the leadership is consumed by the need to strengthen “the levees they rely on to keep the waters of a turbulent society in check.”3 Protecting the Party While the Party’s primary focus remains on domestic issues such as corruption deemed central to its legitimacy, Chinese leaders have sharpened their focus on those aspects of developing country relationships deemed likely to bolster the Party’s fortunes amid this turbulence.4 Two significant areas in which the CCP has stepped up influence efforts to benefit Party control are the economic and information domains.5 First, Beijing wants to mitigate mounting economic challenges and slowing growth in China through overseas investment and the creation of markets abroad for Chinese goods and materials. The Party’s legitimacy depends on the health of China’s economy.6 Access to resources needed to feed China’s growing economy has long driven its engagement with the developing world, but China’s economy is now struggling. Chinese leaders are therefore looking to further boost overseas investment and trade, which have been growing for years but have been partially rebranded under the BRI. As part of its broader economic development strategy, Beijing is using BRI to export massive quantities of steel and aluminum, find new markets for Chinese products, and help keep indebted state-owned enterprises (SOEs) afloat.7 BRI projects, many of which are implemented through provincial governments eager to capitalize, facilitate the expansion of Chinese companies’ international footprint.8 These efforts are viewed as critical to propping up growth and employment as China endures an uncertain transition from a manufacturing focus to services and consumption, including potential reforms likely to result in layoffs.9 BRI-linked economic initiatives, and China’s narrative and diplomatic push tied to the promise of BRI infrastructure funding, translate into significant Chinese influence in developing countries.10 Some of this influence is a natural result of a $13 trillion economy showering promises of investment on developing countries desperate for infrastructure. The opacity and the nature of Chinese investment practices, however, have resulted in significant negative effects on countries’ economies and political institutions. For example, some developing countries, such as Sri Lanka, have assumed unsustainable debt burdens as a result of Chinese infrastructure financing deals, ultimately resulting in a loss of sovereignty over strategic assets.11 While China’s approach in most developing countries is less aggressive, it is still frequently corrosive of democratic institutions, increasing corruption and undermining financial and political independence.12 China, in part to defend its economic interests, also interferes in the political systems of developing countries around the world, tipping the scales towards China-friendly politicians and policies.13 China, in part to defend its economic interests, also interferes in the political systems of developing countries around the world, tipping the scales towards China-friendly politicians and policies. A second way the CCP tries to bolster its legitimacy through influencing the developing world is by manipulating the information space to China’s advantage, a practice now commonly termed “sharp power.” Beijing wants to protect its growing investments, ensure Party control over ideology and information that might enter China, and legitimize China’s authoritarian development model abroad.14 Presenting a positive “China story,” as Xi has put it, helps to smooth the path for investments that benefit China’s economy. The CCP recognizes that a more positive perception of China heads off criticism of Chinese investments and corruption of a country’s elites, thereby preventing Chinese influence from becoming a political issue as it has in Zambia, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia.15 Through media cooperation agreements with BRI countries, Beijing advances information sharing intended to influence foreign journalists covering the BRI, including through conferences sponsored by the state-affiliated All-China Journalists Association. As the Party has driven Chinese society toward more state-sponsored ideological conformity to create a lasting basis for authoritarian Party rule, it also desires greater ideological control abroad.16 Despite increased efforts to limit “infiltration” of outside values and ideas, Chinese have growing access to Western news, content, and culture.17 The CCP judges that, as China continues to “open up” to reap the benefits of playing a more central role in the global economy, it will need to “sanitize” the external information environment to ensure that such opening does not invite ideological challenges to Party control. Among developing countries, China is most concerned about its “periphery,” where it fears ideological contagion from democratization and “color revolution” might cross into China. Deng Xiaoping, commenting on allowing dangerous foreign influences to circulate in China as it opened to the world, once remarked, “If you open the window for fresh air, you have to expect some flies to blow in.” The CCP is now looking to kill as many flies as possible inside developing countries as it deepens engagement with them. Lastly, the CCP shapes information in developing countries as part of an effort to legitimize the Party and China’s authoritarian system on the global stage. China’s promised rise and rejuvenation as a great power, a key pillar of the Party’s legitimacy, requires expanding its normative power abroad. Chinese leaders recognize that to achieve legitimacy as a responsible great power without democratizing—a prospect not welcomed by the developed West—they must first popularize China’s model in the developing world.18 These efforts also support China’s economic goals. Gaining widespread support for its model has become more important as China depends more on a favorable climate for Chinese investments. The CCP conducts large-scale trainings of foreign officials about its development methods and provides increasingly sophisticated technology to authoritarian governments.19 China frequently reprints in domestic official media the “positive China stories” told in foreign media, using reflections of China’s rejuvenation and responsible global role to stoke patriotic sentiment to CCP benefit.20 Chinese leaders recognize that to achieve legitimacy as a responsible great power without democratizing—a prospect not welcomed by the developed West—they must first popularize China’s model in the developing world The CCP has a large and growing set of tools it uses to advance its narrative in developing countries and to quiet critics, including pervasive but overt official propaganda and media outlets, covert efforts to cultivate thought leaders, and more aggressive use of the Party’s United Front Work Department (UFWD) to squelch anti-China narratives by “enemy forces” abroad perceived to threaten Party control at home.21 As at home, enhanced Party control over all aspects of its foreign engagement has accelerated under Xi, propelling influence efforts in developing countries.22 Greater CCP coordination of propaganda and information manipulation efforts abroad, combined with the granting of increased power and bureaucratic sway to the UFWD, have streamlined overlapping functions, enhancing their effectiveness.23 Party committees have been strengthened within both SOEs and private Chinese firms operating abroad, and Party discipline inspectors are now embedded in every government organ.24 Bigger than Xi China’s push for greater influence in the developing world, therefore, is a product not only of geopolitical opportunism or aggressive policies under a more powerful Xi, but also of a more fundamental external manifestation of China’s more hardline authoritarianism at home, deemed necessary for the Party’s continued survival. Much like its approach to industrial policies deemed essential to China’s economic future, China’s tactics in the developing world are inherent to the Party’s methods to achieve China’s “rejuvenation” and ensure regime control. In other words, the problem is more dire than if it was solely a result of one man’s pursuit of unbridled power. The CCP is unlikely to be deterred from pursuing economic advantages and manipulation of information through strong criticism or appeals to universal values.25 China’s tactics in the developing world are inherent to the Party’s methods to achieve China’s “rejuvenation” and ensure regime control. Furthermore, there is a good chance that Chinese leaders will become even more focused on preserving Party rule in the face of mounting challenges at home, even as China grows more powerful abroad. China’s approach to developing countries in this scenario will increasingly reflect the short-term demands of Party control rather than considerations of China’s long-term interests in a country. This would result in China seeking quick returns on investments abroad and more heavy-handed propaganda and “sharp power” efforts to shape the narrative to protect Chi",2013-2017,13,high_conflict
30,2013,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/seven-years-into-chinas-belt-and-road/,en,"David Dollar outlines the impact that China’s Belt and Road Initiative has had over the past seven years, and it’s broader economic and geopolitical opportunities and challenges it has brought to both the U.S. and regional actors. This piece was originally published by the Ripon Society. President Xi Jinping of China proposed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in a pair of speeches in 2013. In Kazakhstan, he outlined a vision of restoring overland trade routes from China to Central Asia and Europe — the ancient “Silk Road.” In Indonesia, he introduced the concept of a “maritime Silk road,” which is essentially the already well-traveled sea corridor South from China to the Middle East and Europe. In seven years of implementation, the initiative has become quite controversial, especially in the West. The controversy is fueled by a lack of transparency that makes it difficult to get reliable information on the financing involved in the initiative, as well as the specific projects and their terms. There are a growing number of academic efforts, however, to collect and analyze data on BRI, with a consistent set of findings. Despite the name, the program is global, not confined to the specific corridors. It is primarily a program to fund infrastructure. About two-thirds of the financing goes to power and transport. Total funding has been on the order of $50-100 billion per year. Most of the loans are in dollars on commercial terms that are more generous than developing countries can get from private investors, but much more costly than funds from Western donors or the concessional windows of the multilateral development banks. A number of major clients of China are well-known pariah states such as Iran or Venezuela. But overall Chinese financing across countries is uncorrelated with measures of democracy: in other words, other major borrowers are democracies such as South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Indonesia, or Brazil. A World Bank study in 2019 examined the transport projects along the overland and maritime routes. It concluded that there were potentially large benefits to the recipient countries and to the world if transport costs could be reduced through improved infrastructure. But the study also found that in many cases policy impediments were greater than infrastructure impediments – that is, import tariffs, investment restrictions, customs delays, bureaucracy, red tape, and corruption often increase trade costs dramatically. The clear point from this study is that improving the investment climate is a necessary complement to investing in infrastructure. One practical way to do this is through deep trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership which includes some important developing economies such as Colombia, Malaysia, Peru, and Vietnam. The U.S. could have tied this group of Asia-Pacific economies much closer to our system but chose to drop out. Meanwhile, China has reached a trade liberalization agreement among ASEAN, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. It is not a deep agreement, but it does eliminate tariffs on parts and components and lays a foundation for Asian value chains that exclude the U.S. BRI raises a number of issues for the U.S. American officials have criticized the program as “debt trap diplomacy.” This fear seems exaggerated. Most of the countries borrowing from China also borrow from Western donors, the multilateral banks, and private bond holders. They have diversified sources of finance, and there is no reason to think that they are particularly beholden to China. The exceptions would be the pariah states, and in developing a strategy for dealing with Venezuela or Iran it is important to take into account China’s investments and interests there. While it is hard to find evidence of debt trap diplomacy, there are real concerns about debt sustainability that are relevant for all lenders. Foreign debt is different from domestic debt in that it ultimately has to be serviced via exports, and there are clear limits to how much debt poor countries can take on. Furthermore, the pandemic and recession drive home how quickly the perception of sustainability can change. Prior to COVID-19, most developing countries looked good in terms of debt sustainability, according to IMF analysis. But the recession is having a devastating effect on GDP and exports. Of China’s main clients in Africa, a majority are now in debt distress or at high risk of debt distress. China has joined the other G20 countries in offering poor countries a moratorium on debt servicing during 2020. For China’s 15 big clients in Africa, its share of 2020 debt servicing is about one-third – a figure that shows both the importance of Chinese finance but also that other official creditors and the private sector are collectively even more important. China’s participation in the debt moratorium is positive, though it is only a small first step since interest will be accruing and debt burdens rising. Some countries are likely to need debt restructuring or write-downs, normally organized through the Paris Club, of which China is not a member. The U.S. has an interest in drawing China into the Paris Club and cooperating with China on debt relief to ensure that there is not a new round of debt crises paralyzing the developing world. The U.S. has launched a new development finance institution to compete with China. Providing developing countries with more financing sources is a smart strategy, but this initiative by itself will probably not change the picture very much. Developing countries have various funding sources already. They prefer to use Chinese financing for big projects in transport and power for specific reasons. Private funding is too expensive and short-term (usually max five years). Western donors and their multilateral banks give grants or lend on extraordinarily generous terms. But these traditional donors prefer to finance social services, administration, democracy-promotion – they have gotten out of hard infrastructure almost completely. In its early days, 70% of World Bank financing went to economic infrastructure; now, it is around 30%. Related to that, doing big infrastructure with the Western donors is bureaucratic and time-consuming; basically, poor countries have to follow first-world regulations. So, countries rationally allocate China to do transport and power, the Western donors to do social sectors, and private bondholders to provide general, short-term budget finance. In summary, a more effective response to BRI on the part of the U.S. would: embrace new, deep trade agreements that would improve the investment climate in developing countries and tie them more closely to the U.S.; lead a reform of the multilateral banks and its new finance institution that would streamline the red tape around infrastructure projects and provide an attractive alternative; dial down the anti-China rhetoric; and encourage China to be more transparent and to provide more generous terms and participate in debt relief as needed.

31,2013,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/signing-up-or-standing-aside-disaggregating-participation-in-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative/,en,"This piece was updated on November 5, 2020 with corrected codings regarding a country’s bilateral accord type. The analysis shifted accordingly to focus on the distinctions between Belt and Road Initiative participants versus non-participants. As a global campaign to promote international trade, investment, and infrastructure connectivity, China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has made headlines since its launch in 2013. Countries located along the BRI’s corridors, including China, account for one-third of the world’s trade and gross domestic product (GDP) and nearly two-thirds of its population.1 As the BRI’s geographic scope continues to grow, countries must decide whether to join — and to what extent they should participate. As of January 2020, 138 countries have signed on to the BRI, ranging from Italy to Saudi Arabia to Cambodia.2 BRI participants span the globe, although significant regional variation exists: overall participation levels are highest in Central Asia and Africa, lower in Europe and Latin America, and non-existent in North America. However, BRI participants are not all created equal. When countries sign up, some ink a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with China, while others conclude a cooperation agreement. A MoU is the highest level of agreement for parties to the BRI. MoUs typically contain more specific provisions, such as details about particular projects to be developed with Chinese investment. In contrast, cooperation agreements have more general terms and may simply express a shared intent to collaborate in the context of the BRI. While some countries have converted their bilateral accords with China from cooperation agreements to MoUs, there are no examples of the opposite occurring, further demonstrating that a MoU represents an upgrade in BRI participation from a cooperation agreement. Identifying which countries are not in the BRI is just as important as pinpointing those that are. As of January 2020, 57 countries have not joined the BRI. In addition to the United States and Canada in North America, most of these countries are clustered in Europe and Latin America, with smaller numbers found in Asia and Africa. Even though BRI participation promises significant economic benefits, concerns persist about debt traps, corruption, security concerns related to Chinese investment, and ongoing territorial conflicts such as in the South China Sea and the China-India border.3 Yet several U.S.-aligned countries have bucked overall regional trends and joined the BRI, such as Italy, South Korea, and New Zealand.4 Figure 1 below summarizes variation in BRI participation levels. Figure 1: Variation in BRI Participation by Country What are the attributes of countries that join the BRI through cooperation agreements versus MoUs — and those that eschew it entirely? Non-BRI participant countries are most likely to be in Europe, North America, or Latin America and the Caribbean. They have the highest percentage of collective defense agreements with the United States and are the most democratic, most politically stable, and most economically developed. Of the countries that have signed a cooperation agreement with China to participate in the BRI, fully half are in sub-Saharan Africa. These states have the fewest collective defense agreements with the United States and are the least democratic, least politically stable, and least economically developed. Countries that have inked MoUs to join the BRI are the largest group. Most of these MoU countries are in Asia. They have fewer collective defense agreements with the United States than non-BRI participant countries, but more than cooperation agreement countries. MoU countries are less democratic, politically stable, and economically developed than non-BRI participant countries, but more so than cooperation agreement countries. Figure 2 and Table 1 below summarize key characteristics of MoU, cooperation agreement, and non-BRI participant countries. Table 1: Attributes of BRI and Non-BRI Participant Countries Note: A higher Democracy Index score indicates more democratic; a higher Political Stability score indicates greater instability. Sources: World Bank Country and Lending Groups (2019), United States Department of State – United States Collective Defense Arrangements (2017), The Economist Intelligence Unit – Democracy Index (2020), The Fund for Peace – Fragile States Index (2019)5 These patterns reveal that breadth of the BRI is as much a priority for China as depth. The large number of states that have signed cooperation agreements but not MoUs suggests a “waiting room” phenomenon: Beijing wants to bring countries into the initiative to enhance its scope and prestige, but has yet to upgrade bilateral commitments. Such variation in participation levels illuminates China’s strategic goals for the BRI and its future development trajectory. Specifically, it reveals that China has prioritized its neighbors in Asia and states that are relatively more economically developed, politically stable, and democratic. At the same time, however, the attributes of non-BRI participant countries — the most economically developed, politically stable, and closely aligned with the United States — suggest that BRI expansion may slow in the future even as upgrading of participation levels within it continue. The U.S. government has consistently been skeptical, if not openly critical, of the BRI. The United States has urged allies not to join the BRI, giving some countries the impression of a choice between the United States or China.6 Since 2013, analysts have variously described the BRI as China’s grand strategy to alter post-war American hegemony, rewrite international trade rules, and tilt U.S. allies toward China.7 Trump administration officials have taken an increasingly combative stance against the BRI. In 2017, then-Defense Secretary James Mattis stated: “I think in a globalized world, there are many belts and many roads, and no one nation should put itself into a position of dictating ‘One Belt, One Road.’”8 Yet while U.S. officials continue to view the BRI in opposition to American interests, others argue that the United States should support the BRI to steer it in a direction that benefits both countries and advances shared international development goals.9 While it remains extremely unlikely that the United States will join the BRI, the outcome of the 2020 U.S. presidential election may well prompt a reorientation of U.S. strategy towards the initiative. Today, the ongoing COVID-19 crisis is also reshaping the BRI. Many BRI participant countries are diverting attention and resources towards urgent public health and welfare needs, hindering their ability to repay debts to China.10 It also remains to be seen whether China will still be willing to finance BRI projects that the pandemic has rendered commercially questionable or even inviable. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced in June 2020 that a fifth of BRI projects have already been “seriously affected” by COVID-19.11 Others, such as former People’s Bank of China governor Zhou Xiaochuan, portray COVID-19 as an opportunity for China to raise more BRI funding and optimize existing financing arrangements.12 Yet project delays and disruption due to border restrictions, supply chain turmoil, and financing issues suggest the BRI may be headed for a serious long-term slowdown. And while China’s expressed political commitment to the initiative remains strong, its primary focus will be reviving its own economy and preventing the virus’s domestic return.13 Looking to the future, Beijing’s use of cooperation agreements and MoUs highlights its pragmatic diplomatic approach toward cultivating political ties and commercial opportunity. China has long embraced “soft law”: quasi-legal instruments like cooperation agreements and MoUs that formally affirm commitment and cooperative intent but are not legally binding.14 Soft law appeals to both China and participant countries because it avoids codifying concrete obligations. Instead, soft law enables each side to flexibly tailor commitments based on circumstances particular to a given time and place. Such flexibility may become even more important in the future, as COVID-19 continues to slow global growth and limit governmental resources.15 If China succeeds in reviving its economy while other states struggle to restart theirs, then joining the BRI or upgrading participation could become more desirable — despite continued U.S. criticism of the initiative. - Footnotes - Michele Ruta, “Three opportunities and three risks of the Belt and Road Initiative,” The World Bank, May 4, 2018, https://blogs.worldbank.org/trade/three-opportunities-and-three-risks-belt-and-road-initiative. - Liu Meng, “一同中国签订共建‘一带一路’合作文件的国家一览” [ A list of the countries that have signed cooperation documents with China to jointly build the Belt and Road], 中国一带一路网 [Belt and Road Portal], https://www.yidaiyilu.gov.cn/xwzx/roll/77298.htm. - Lucy Hornby, “Belt and Road debt trap accusations hound China as it hosts forum,” Financial Times, April 23, 2019, https://www.ft.com/content/3e9a0266-6500-11e9-9adc-98bf1d35a056; Elaine K.

32,2013,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-climate-of-chinese-checks-easing-global-warming-by-greening-chinese-foreign-infrastructure-investment/,en,"Low-carbon energy technologies are surging, and that’s due to China’s desire to make a buck. A decade ago, solar and wind power ballooned from regional oddities into international businesses, a transformation fueled by China’s push to corner a fledgling industry. Today, renewables are among the fastest-growing global energy sources, driven significantly by the latest advance in China’s push for profit: a national focus on assembling gargantuan infrastructure projects beyond China’s borders, in dozens of developing countries, from Pakistan to Peru. The enduring strength of the clean-energy market, and China’s central role as that market’s maker, are worth noting at a time when the coronavirus has slashed overall energy demand and has ratcheted up geopolitical tensions between the Chinese and U.S. governments to a level not seen in decades. But neither the global clean-energy push nor China’s role in it is adequate to stave off dangerous climate change. There is a better way. For the United States, whose global influence has tanked but can recover, it involves an adult approach to the energy and environmental initiatives of China and of myriad developing countries — an approach based not on easy jingoism but on hard facts. The first step is understanding that the trajectory of climate change will depend on decisions about the sort of infrastructure that Chinese entities fund abroad— and that those decisions result not from omnipotent fiat in Beijing but from complex debates throughout China and across the countries in which Chinese entities are writing checks. The next step — particularly since the United States seems unlikely to radically increase its own global-infrastructure financing, regardless of who wins the November presidential election — is for the United States to re-engage abroad on climate-related matters with sophistication rather than sophistry. That re-engagement should seek to shift financial incentives toward lower-carbon infrastructure, both for Chinese investors and for their clients across the globe. This approach would benefit not only the Earth, but also, and more practically, U.S. investors. Chinese money and the planet Like most organisms, China is a paradox. It remains the world’s largest coal-burner1 even as it is the biggest producer of renewable-energy technology and of renewable energy itself.2 Like the rest of the world, China still produces the overwhelming majority of its energy by burning fossil fuels, not by harnessing Mother Nature’s gauzier gifts. (In 2018, fossil fuels provided 88% of the energy used in China and 81% of the energy used globally, according to the International Energy Agency, or IEA. The likely numbers for 2040, the IEA says, are 76% in China and 74% globally.3) China’s ramp-up of clean energy over the past several years has been simultaneously fruitful and fitful. Its foreign-infrastructure-financing push massively raises the global economic and environmental stakes of China’s still-nascent clean-energy shift. Beijing, along with various Chinese provinces and hundreds of state-owned and private Chinese firms, is bankrolling and building everything from power plants to factories to electric-transmission lines across a swath of the planet that, according to the World Bank, comprises nearly two-thirds of its people and about one-third of global gross domestic product.4 Whether that Chinese-financed infrastructure is high-carbon or low-carbon — what level of emissions the projects lock in for decades to come — will, more than any other set of policies at play in the world today, determine the future both of the global fossil-fuel-based economy and of global warming. Hanging in the balance are the fortunes of some of the planet’s biggest corporations — firms that dominate sectors from power to oil to automobiles. Also hanging in the balance, as climate change intensifies, is the planet itself. China’s foreign infrastructure-building campaign, a policy push that President Xi Jinping announced in 2013, typically is dubbed the Belt and Road Initiative. In practice, the moniker tends to amount to little more than a marketing slogan. Actors in and out of China commonly disagree about which infrastructure projects are part of it and which are not; indications are that the projects in it are those that China and host countries want, for their own political reasons, to trumpet. Whatever it’s called, China’s foreign-infrastructure building boom has prompted profound geopolitical, economic, and environmental concerns. The debate boils down to the same conundrum over China’s motives that has preoccupied outsiders for decades: Hegemon or helper? Communist or capitalist? And now: Dirty or clean? In the United States, resistance to China’s foreign-infrastructure campaign comes from leaders on both sides of the political aisle. Much of the American right views the Chinese push as a threat to U.S. geopolitical influence and economic reach. Much of the American left sees China as a global polluter. The left posits that, though China is reforming its smoke-spewing ways, primarily to reduce smog above its cities, it isn’t doing so nearly fast enough to meaningfully curb China’s outsized contribution to global carbon emissions, and it isn’t applying the same rigor to cleaning up what it builds in other countries as it is to what it builds at home. The United States is not alone in leveling such criticism; similar debates over China’s actions are playing out in most major industrialized economies, not to mention in many of the developing countries receiving large amounts of Chinese infrastructure money. The carbon footprint of the foreign energy infrastructure China is financing is existentially important. If countries that have signed on to the Belt and Road Initiative develop their infrastructure on a business-as-usual path, by 2050 they will account for two-thirds of global emissions, according to a 2019 study by Tsinghua University and London-based consultant Vivid Economics.5 Those global emissions, moreover, will be double the level that would trigger a rise in average global temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the threshold below which scientists agree it is necessary for the world to stay to avoid particularly dangerous consequences from climate change. That will happen, the study found, even in the exceedingly improbable event that the rest of world somehow gets green religion and swings its development onto a significantly more-sustainable path.6 The upshot: Curbing climate change requires greening China’s foreign-infrastructure financing. It’s not just China Most analyses of the environmental effects of Chinese spending on foreign infrastructure focus on the aggregate effects. They conclude with concern that China is financing more fossil-fueled than renewable energy. That may indeed be concerning, but, as some of the studies themselves note, it’s hardly surprising.7 For all of renewable energy’s torrid growth in recent years, fossil fuels remain by far the largest global energy source. The practical question isn’t just whether Chinese money is building more dirty-energy infrastructure than clean-energy infrastructure. It’s whether Chinese money is building dirtier infrastructure than non-Chinese money is building — and why. The practical question isn’t just whether Chinese money is building more dirty-energy infrastructure than clean-energy infrastructure. It’s whether Chinese money is building dirtier infrastructure than non-Chinese money is building — and why. Research underway at Stanford, where I work, is endeavoring to illuminate that.9 Rather than tallying aggregate Chinese fossil-fuel-versus-renewable investments — because, at least broadly, existing research has calculated that— the work seeks to compare the carbon intensity of infrastructure financed by Chinese players with that of infrastructure financed by multilateral, bilateral, and other non-Chinese entities. One goal is to determine whether Chinese investment is making these countries’ energy systems more or less carbon-intensive than they would be absent the Chinese funding. Another is to illuminate why key developing countries that previously relied largely on Western sources for infrastructure finance are now looking to China for much of that money. This research is designed to reflect the way that global infrastructure funding actually works, politically and economically — and thus to elucidate particularly realistic ways to meaningfully decarbonize Chinese infrastructure financing. The research is in its early stages. But it already clarifies the way decisions are made about what sort of energy infrastructure gets built with Chinese financing. The decisions are not, as many China critics in the West suggest, the result of some supreme order issued in Beijing. They are messier, and thus more malleable, than that. They depend, in particular, on two things. For one thing, they depend on an ever-shifting balance of power inside China between opposite camps in what amounts to the mother of all energy-system transitions. On one side is China’s old-energy lobby, the shrinking but still-massive juggernaut invested in the continuation of an economy powered largely by coal: mining it, transporting it, and building and operating the massive machinery that burns it. This camp is largely government-controlled, run by many of the massive state-owned enterprises that have dominated China’s economy for decades. On the other side is the new-energy lobby, the growing but still-smaller constituency that earns its money by making, selling, and operating everything from solar panels to wind turbines to batteries to electric cars. This group includes prominent private firms founded in the last decade or so by entrepreneurs and widely traded on Western stock exchanges, which is to say owned by investors around the globe. The fight between the high-carbon and low-carbon energy camps is, to be sure, a battle among industries, among companies, and among government ministries. Increasingly and crucially, though, as the economic case for renewables grows more compelling, it also is a fight within each of those institutions. That is because advocates of a clean-energy shift are emerging even inside entities that for years have made their money from dirty energy. These fights over decarbonization are playing out in many countries, particularly in the most economically powerful ones, notably the United States, Germany, Japan, and Australia. What is different in China is, as always, size: the scale of the energy market, the speed of the push by massive domestic companies to export energy machinery, and, thus, the stakes. In addition, just as decisions about the carbon intensity of the energy infrastructure China finances internationally depend on a power struggle underway within China, they depend on the priorities of the countries ordering up the Chinese-financed projects. Countries that have articulated more ambitious decarbonization policies tend to get Chinese financing for greener infrastructure. Countries with policies pushing coal, on the other hand, typically find that China is quite happy to help them pay to extend the overhang of that rock. Individual Chinese institutions — literally, in some cases, the same Chinese banks — are funding coal-heavy infrastructure portfolios in some countries and renewables-heavy portfolios in others. In other words, to a meaningful extent, the customer gets what the customer wants. Dirty begets dirty, and clean begets clean. What Washington should do All of which suggests a way forward for the United States amid the coronavirus-related cratering of political relations between Beijing and Washington and given the imperative to act meaningfully on climate change. Trying to block China’s foreign-infrastructure investment would be foolish, both because China has strategic and economic motives for that spending and because the Unit",2013-2017,6,high_conflict
33,2013,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-evolving-relationship-between-the-international-development-architecture-and-chinas-belt-and-road/,en,"China’s entry into foreign assistance 20 years ago has largely coincided with the evolution and advancement of international development architectures in support of shared development good practice and norms. China’s One Belt and One Road (OBOR) — today BRI — launched by President Xi Jinping in 2013, is a dramatic collection of investment projects with the potential to reshape the international development landscape at national and international levels. The willingness of China to abide by international rules and processes for these investments has been secondary to its interest of shaping norms for its favor. Whether or not one considers BRI development as largely irrelevant, China is poised to use development-like transactions to extend its global presence and influence. BRI represented a shift in China’s overall posture on assistance and its vision of foreign affairs more broadly. At the time of its launch, BRI was estimated at $113 billion; today, the total is estimated at a few times that number.1 Prior to BRI, China focused on domestic (not international) economic growth, which resulted in 70% of the population rising out of poverty by 2010. In 2000, China signaled interest in the development space beyond its own hemisphere when it hosted 44 African countries for the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation followed by a series of Chinese infrastructure projects as part of a larger “going out” effort for Chinese investment.2By 2014, China had articulated priority areas for aid in a white paper which cited a focus on win-win outcomes and the independence of developing countries.3 The reality of BRI, particularly its complex accounting, presents a contrast to the ideals and rhetoric presented in the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation final declaration and in China’s development white paper. Chinese assistance is made up of grants; concessional, interest free, and commercial loans (which often lead to high debt); and support from Chinese foundations and private individuals. Over time, funding has become even more complex as China has come to rely heavily on pooled financing from its Central Bank, the Chinese Import-Export Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In 2016, analysis by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) cited discrepancies in the funding streams which resulted in an “unbalanced picture of China’s performance as a development partner.”4 UNDP’s report was part of a growing movement for major international reform in support of responsible financing in the international development system. Led by the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC), international donors increasingly called for improved accountability. These discussions were codified in the 2005 Paris Agreement on Development Effectiveness, which set the standard for measuring and tracking Official Development Assistance and outlined the (Paris) principles for improved: ownership, alignment, harmonization, management, and accountability. The 2008 Accra Agenda for Action and the 2011 Busan Agreement furthered the “reform agenda” for responsible development.5 Today’s international development architecture — including frameworks such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Paris Principles, and the infrastructure of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation on Development (OECD) — are well poised to advance compliance with good governance norms and practice for development. However, without China’s buy-in to the underlying premises (e.g., transparency, accountability, and participation), these frameworks lack influence. Getting to a steady state in compliance with international standards and norms will require all of China to commit to data sharing in advance of a shared rules-based order for international development. In-country impact As part of the development effectiveness conversations in capitals, the United States and other “like-minded” donors were keen to influence the emerging Chinese model through capacity-building and advocacy for good donor norms. However, BRI transactions did not pause for donors, conferences, or capacity workshops. Instead, from Sri Lanka to Djibouti, new large-scale infrastructure projects proceeded in a manner that contested donor transparency and global development norms. Examples of these transactions and associated risks cut across geography — and several BRI projects, some of which preceded the initiative’s formal launch, have been controversial. These include: the 99-year lease for Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port, use of the Port of Mombasa as collateral to finance new projects in Kenya, and Ethiopia’s mountain of growing debt owed to Beijing.6 While it may not be the intent of the project, the result often is unsustainable debt loads. For that reason, this so-called “debt trap diplomacy” is not just hyperbole; data from the Center for Global Development identified 8 countries (of 23 studied) that were at high risk of BRI-sourced debt distress leading to adverse impacts on planned public investment and economic growth.7 Less studied, but still as troubling, are the social, environmental, and human rights risks, including Cambodia’s Sihanoukville port project and Malaysia’s Melaka Gateway, billion dollar projects that disrupted local supply chains and ecosystems and increased reports of corruption.8 Data suggests that these are not one-off examples, but part of a trendline toward China’s flexibility at the expense of local ownership. The College of William & Mary’s extraordinary AidData project has shown that Chinese assistance is more likely to be associated with higher levels of local corruption, most likely due to the lack of internationally recognized institutional safeguards — such as “competitive bidding, citizen feedback mechanisms, blacklisting of corrupt firms,” and preference for individuals in power to determine projects (as opposed to industry standards for safeguards via social, need, and environmental analysis).9This “laissez-faire” approach has given rise to the label of “rogue donor,” for China’s misalignment with international standards, interest in supporting political elites, and decentralized management.10 New research from the Center for Global Development (CGD) shows that while there have been minor improvements in short-term accounting of China’s transactions by local governments, Chinese assistance remains insufficiently aligned to “country plans and priorities,” in the long term.11This strategic misalignment illustrates China’s vision of assistance. Strategic planning and priority setting require buy-in to the national objectives and a willingness to adapt priorities to local demands as opposed to externally or politically mandated ones. Traditional development donors take great (bureaucratic) pain to support the systems and priorities of the host country. Placing the host country at the center of the process leads to strong relationships and often stronger development outcomes. Conversely, China has snubbed both international regulation and local implementation norms. As a result, protests and public pressure from Kazakhstan to the Maldives have led governments to turn away from assistance and others to be voted out of office.12 China has taken steps to respond to domestic and international critique. In 2016, Beijing announced an effort to “green” BRI through application of international standards for energy and climate risk.13 In April 2018, China created an International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA) to oversee BRI projects, shifting control from the Ministry of Commerce. In 2019, the government issued “Measures for the Administration of Foreign Aid” guidance, which focused on improved monitoring, transparency, and accountability.14 So far, reform has had a limited impact. Analysis by the International Development Studies found that green BRI standards were appropriate, but had little impact on implementation.15 Similarly, while the launch of CIDCA was a symbolic step it has not been sufficient for meaningful reform and centralization. In its current form — a deputy-level ministry with a limited budget and staff — CIDCA lacks the authority and systems to meaningfully manage global projects.16 Where China has been successful in pushing back on its critics is leveraging international institutions. During China’s annual Belt and Road Forum in 2019, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres launched a partnership between BRI and the U.N. SDGs.17 The secretary-general’s endorsement was not conjecture. The endorsement formalized a partnership between BRI and SDG programming in a number of developing countries. This was remarkably novel; while it is common for bilateral donors to work with U.N. agencies on broad themes, this was the first time the U.N. had engaged in such co-planning, funding, and branding at the project level.18 This interest in shared activities, however, has not resulted in China’s buy-in to the accountability and transparency norms that underlie the SDGs. In fact, China continues to be out of step with global financing for development norms, even while they are absolutely foundational for achieving the SDGs. Analysis of similar partnerships between BRI and the Multilateral Development Banks resulted in CGD’s conclusion that these organizations were “lending their reputations” while not getting broader adherence to standards.19 As a result of not aligning with financing standards, measuring levels of assistance and impact of BRI projects remains “guess work.” Lack of good data and a general shirking of international norms and practices is a major critique from other bilateral donors, who struggle with how to engage China on development. Lack of good data and a general shirking of international norms and practices is a major critique from other bilateral donors, who struggle with how to engage China on development. The prevailing options — contain, collaborate, or compete — lack the nuance necessary to respond to the shape-shifting nature of BRI. This tension is perhaps the most acute in developing countries where national governments are sandwiched between donors with disparate approaches, often focused on a range of their own national political interests. The tension between global powers is likely to continue to play out in the trajectory of developing countries and the contraction and expansion of their debt burdens and open governance space. Despite the ongoing debate and well-known risks of partnerships at the international level, developing countries continue to sign on to receive support from China. According to the New York Times, China invested some $128 billion through BRI in the first 11 months of 2019, up 41% over the same time period in 2018.20 Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) between China and new BRI partners have increased from a modest 65 of MOUs in 2016 to 138 in 2020.21 A convergence on COVID-19 The COVID-19 crisis has led to an acceleration of three key trends in the scope and scale of China’s transactions in developing countries. First, China has increased the visibility and quantity of donations of personal protection equipment and medical technology (i.e. “mask diplomacy”); second, BRI projects are financed by a heavier mix of Chinese private foundations and private individuals (mirroring efforts to bridge domestic financing gaps); and third, an uptick in exports of technology infrastructure (such as artificial intelligence and facial recognition software) which has the potential to threaten local civil liberties and privacy rights long after COVID-19. China has faced reputational damage due to their COVID response, as well as a perceived failure to contain the virus and persecution of dissent. This damage, paired with the high levels of requests and the unlikely nature of debt relief efforts, could lead to an over-extension of BRI.

34,2013,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-political-significance-of-chinas-latest-commitments-to-africa/,en,"In my recent blog post, I examined the financial pledges China made at the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) and the evolving Chinese economic priorities these commitments represent. Beyond the specific financial commitments, the rest of the eight actions meet the traditional checklist on infrastructure, agriculture and industrialization, and trade facilitation, and continue to expand on China’s interests in green development, health care, and peace and security issues. As a political event, the FOCAC Summit usually reflects China’s current priorities in foreign strategy. The Beijing Summit was no exception. In the eight days during and around the summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with every leader from the 53 African countries present at the event, emphasizing a Sino-Africa Community of Common Destiny. Judging from the statements, the summit advanced two political messages. Externally, China is making serious efforts to consolidate African countries’ support of China’s international agenda, especially in light of the Trump administration’s China and trade policies. Internally, between China and Africa, China is upping its game on Africa’s capacity building, a phrase currently spearheaded by China’s soft power campaign and effort to promote the Chinese model of political and economic development in developing countries. The 2018 FOCAC Summit occurred at a time when Chinese foreign policy has encountered major obstacles. On the one hand, the U.S.-China trade war has raised questions, domestically and externally, about China’s ability to sustain hostilities with the U.S. On the other hand, China’s own Belt and Road Initiative, five years after its launch, has run into serious questions about China’s expansionist intention as well as financial and security concerns from the recipient countries. At this critical juncture, Africa could provide the needed moral, rhetorical, and political support of China’s benevolent intention and global leadership. The Sino-Africa Community of Common Destiny approach is based on the closely connected fate of China and Africa as emerging markets and developing countries. Such an alliance could challenge the global north led by the U.S., eventually supporting a more balanced international power equilibrium. China and the 53 African countries agreed to “jointly defend the core national interests of each other as well as the interests of developing countries as a whole.” The two sides made a commitment to push for a new model of international relations that is based on mutual respect, fairness, justice, cooperation, and win-win solutions. The “new model of international relations,” or the “democratization of the international relations,” has long been the focus of China’s effort to reform the international system to give China and its allied developing countries a bigger voice and more power. By tying African countries into that narrative, China is consolidating the foundation for its bid to shape a new international order. The political messages to the U.S. from the FOCAC Summit is clear through the joint statement: Without naming names, China and Africa both opposed protectionism and unilateralism, pledging their support for an open world economy and the multilateral trade system. Although China has tried to rally support with developed countries such as those in Europe, Asia, and North America for a coalition against the Trump administration’s trade policy, such efforts have not been particularly successful given those countries’ similar grievance over China’s trade practices. Now with Africa, China’s implicit calling for a coalition finally meets some positive support. To push back on the recent criticisms of China’s relationship with Africa, President Xi particularly pointed to the “five no” approach in China’s Africa policy: “No interference in the development paths of individual countries; no interference in their internal affairs; no imposition of China’s will; no attachment of political strings regarding assistance; and no seeking of selfish political gains in investment and financing cooperation.” Such a claim sounds positive but deserves reflection rather than being taken literally. China’s traditional approach toward Africa on political issues is not coercion oriented but remuneration oriented. Africa’s impact on China’s core national interests is minimal; therefore, it does not justify a coercive approach. Furthermore, China has learned the lesson that the political favors it needs from Africa, such as the support of China’s international agenda, can be achieved through tacit economic remuneration. This implicit but transactional nature of the relationship has made it easy for grandstanding. One major shift in China’s policy from the FOCAC Beijing Summit lies in the expansion of China’s capacity building programs in Africa, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In the 2015 FOCAC commitment, China divided government scholarships and training programs into “cultural cooperation” and “poverty alleviation cooperation.” However, this time around, China specifically raised the banner of capacity building actions. China stated that the goal is to strengthen the exchanges of development experiences and to pursue cooperation in the field of socio-economic development planning. However, in the past decade or so, China’s capacity building programs, especially training programs for African officials and young leaders, have morphed into a systematic campaign to promote China’s development achievements, development models, and bilateral cooperation. In a Western concept, the Chinese capacity building borders the export of Chinese ideology, albeit in a more implicit and indirect form. However, in this case, China’s power does not lie in its imposition, but in its inspiration. In this sense, what is shocking is the quantitative enhancement of China’s capacity building training programs in Africa. In the 2015 FOCAC commitment, China committed to a total of 2,000 educational degree program opportunities, 30,000 government fellowships, visits by 200 African scholars, and training for 500 African youths and 1,000 media personnel. However, this year, the number of government fellowships jumped from 30,000 to 50,000, in addition to the 1,000 African leaders that China will train. Demonstrating China’s keen interests in shaping the next generation of African leaders, China quadrupled the number of African youths to be invited to China for exchanges to 2,000. All of these are impressive, but none are as jaw-dropping as the number of capacity building and training opportunities China has agreed to provide: 50,000 training opportunities to African countries, including government officials, opinion leaders, scholars, journalists, and technical experts. These are essentially the African political, economic, and social elites and opinion leaders that will shape the future of the continent and its relations with China. If there is any political takeaway from the 2018 FOCAC Beijing Summit, it is that China’s bid for Africa has heightened. More than ever before, Africa is emphasized as the “foundation of the foundations of China’s foreign policy” to rally support of developing countries. Such coalition building is not just done through economic reward, but increasingly through the indirect, implicit, and sophisticated campaigns to win the hearts and minds of today and tomorrow’s African elites.

35,2013,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/understanding-chinas-belt-and-road-infrastructure-projects-in-africa/,en,"Executive Summary In 2013, President Xi Jinping proposed that China would create a “Silk Road Economic Belt” across Central Asia and Europe and a “21st Century Maritime Silk Road” running through the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean, on to the Middle East and Europe — programs meant to revive ancient trade routes and reinforce existing ones. Beijing quickly wove these two visions together and dubbed them the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). While seemingly aimed at regional economic corridors, the BRI is in fact global and motivated by economic and strategic interests. A successful BRI would allow China to more efficiently utilize excess savings and construction capacity, expand trade, consolidate economic and diplomatic relations with participating countries, and diversify China’s import of energy and other resources through economic corridors that circumvent routes that are controlled by the U.S. and its allies. The initiative is generally popular in the developing world, where almost all countries face infrastructure deficiencies and a shortage of resources to overcome them. Through large amounts of loans to participating countries to construct infrastructure in various sectors, the BRI can potentially bring significant benefits to these countries by filling their infrastructure gaps and boosting economic growth. While popular with developing countries, the initiative has received various criticisms from advanced industrial economies: that the program lacks transparency and serves to facilitate China’s export of its authoritarian model; that the commercial loan terms are bringing on a new round of debt crises in the developing world; and that the projects have inadequate environmental and social safeguards. This paper examines the implementation of BRI infrastructure projects in Africa in light of available information and concludes that African experiences with the BRI are quite heterogeneous. Some of the major borrowers have debt sustainability problems, while others have integrated the loans from China into sound overall macroeconomic programs. Some of the major borrowers are authoritarian countries with poor records of human rights, but other major participants are among the more democratic countries of Africa. It is hard to make simple generalizations about BRI in Africa. For this reason, it would be wise for Western countries to tone down their rhetoric on BRI, as many of the projects will probably work out well. It would help if Western countries provided more support to the International Monetary Fund to help countries manage their borrowing and to the World Bank to provide more infrastructure financing that increased options for the developing countries of Africa.

36,2013,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/where-progress-with-china-is-most-likely-and-where-it-isnt/,en,"On eight specific issues on which the United States has engaged intensively with China, the scorecard is quite mixed, writes David Dollar. This post is excerpted from a piece originally published with the Democracy Journal. The beginning of China’s rise as a global power can be dated to the country’s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001. Throughout the next 16 years of the Bush and Obama administrations, the United States engaged in intensive bilateral diplomacy with China with the aim of getting ever-greater Chinese support on issues ranging from security to the economy to the environment. The Bush administration launched a Strategic Economic Dialogue with China, and a separate Security Dialogue. President Obama combined these into a single Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED). But the change in form was not important; the dialogues represented a continuous effort to draw China into the global system. Diplomacy is the art of trying to get other countries to do what you want. In the case of the United States, we wanted China to support the economic and security institutions that were established under our leadership at the end of World War II. It is fashionable now to argue that the whole strategy of engaging China and inviting it into our global institutions has failed; but this assessment is too negative. In a recent essay, I identify eight specific issues on which we engaged intensively with China. The scorecard of these results is quite mixed. By my assessment: - In three areas, China’s actions have gone beyond what reasonably could have been expected: currency and global imbalances, climate change, and nuclear non-proliferation (especially regarding Iran and North Korea) - In two areas, the outcomes are about what should have been expected: intellectual property rights protection and development assistance; and - On three issues, China has failed to do what we want: market access, militarization of the South China Sea, and democracy and human rights. It is interesting that these successes and failures do not map onto particular arenas—economic or security. It is this mixed record of diplomacy that makes it difficult to decide what to do next. Some voices call for decoupling and isolating China through a new Cold War, which would be very costly and is too hostile a response to the record. The objective here would be to prevent China from rising to be a co-equal power and is likely to fail. By 2017, there were 144 countries that had more trade with China than with the United States, including 50 countries in Africa and all countries in Asia except Afghanistan and Bhutan. If we try to isolate China, our partners are not likely to follow us, with the result that we isolate ourselves instead. I argue that, alternatively, we can draw on these lessons of failure and success to tailor an engagement strategy going forward that would be effective in getting Chinese cooperation in more areas, though probably not in all areas. The successes all shared the characteristic that China came to see the global public good in question as clearly in its own interest. Also, intensive U.S. bilateral diplomacy was complemented by multilateral institutions. The United States cannot have much hope of changing Chinese behavior if the ask in question cannot be nested in a multilateral agreement. Based on this logic, there is reason to expect that we could do better on the issues of development assistance, intellectual property rights protection, and market access. The best hope for the latter two economic issues is to include them in modern trade agreements that draw in a growing number of countries, including eventually China. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, in particular, was a good effort to address some of China’s abusive trade practices, and it was a big mistake for the United States to pull out of the agreement. The TPP could be a model for larger WTO modernization. On the issue of development assistance, China’s Belt and Road Initiative and its other bilateral efforts are likely to run into various problems due to lack of transparency and competition in implementation and to the commercial nature of the lending, which is already causing debt sustainability problems. Multilateral efforts including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank are likely to be more successful. We should encourage China to learn from these experiences and to both shift more resources to the multilateral institutions and make its bilateral aid more transparent and norm conforming. A key question in the U.S.-China relationship is whether we can cooperate on these various global public goods even as we continue to have some serious disagreements. In the South China Sea, there is a reasonable prospect of a multilateral effort to continue to reinforce freedom of navigation. But there is probably no prospect of reversing China’s militarization of the islands. On democracy and human rights, it is important for the United States to continue to speak out and to strive to be a better example for other countries. But it is not likely that we can do more than that to improve the human rights situation in China. Meanwhile, the U.N. human rights apparatus has largely become subservient to authoritarians, so in this arena a multilateral approach is not likely to generate progress. If we are to coexist peacefully with China, it will be important to be honest about our differences while working together on the large number of issues where we do indeed share common goals and interests and where real progress is possible.

39,2013,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/all-rise-belt-and-road-court-session,en,"All Rise? Belt and Road Court is in Session In February, following a protracted dispute, Djibouti unilaterally terminated a container terminal contract with Dubai-based DP World. The strategically located country on the Horn of Africa may gift control of the terminal to Chinese companies, which inaugurated a free trade zone in the same area earlier this month. The terminal is located just miles from the only permanent U.S. military base in Africa and even closer to China’s only foreign military base. “If the Chinese took over that port, then the consequences could be significant,” the top U.S. military official in Africa said during a congressional hearing in March. The dispute provides a preview of what might become more commonplace along China’s ever-expanding Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), where commercial and strategic objectives mix easily. The sheer scale and complexity of many infrastructure projects guarantees that disputes will arise. That’s why China is not only pushing its projects overseas, but increasingly, it is also writing new rules that advance its interests. The implications for the rules-based order—and U.S. interests—could be profound. One recent move that warrants more attention is China’s decision to establish two international courts that will handle disputes around projects under the BRI. The Supreme People’s Court in Beijing announced the courts in January and passed provisions that came into effect on July 1. One court is based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen and will handle dispute arising along the maritime “Road,” while another based in central Xi’an will handle cases along the overland “Belt.” There are plenty of outstanding questions, but the courts could eventually play a more serious role in advancing Chinese interests. Inevitably, the BRI will continue creating disputes. Large projects are usually delayed, costlier than expected, and deliver fewer benefits than expected. When anything goes wrong, parties look for compensation. Globally, the most common reason for construction disputes, according to the consulting firm Arcadis, is failure to properly administer a contract. Next on the list are poorly drafted or incomplete claims, failure to comply with obligations, and errors or omissions in the contract, respectively. About 32 percent of joint construction ventures experience a dispute. The average dispute takes 14 months to resolve and costs nearly $43 million. Costs are highest in Asia, where they averaged $84 million per dispute in 2016. “Empirical experience would tell you that things are always going to go wrong,” says one consultant. Disputes are even more likely because the BRI aims to traverse some of the world’s most difficult business environments. In South Asia, for example, 75 percent of countries rely on paper records for land rights, leading to confusion and competing ownership claims. Across countries participating in the BRI, the average time for resolving a commercial dispute through a local court is 621 days, according to the World Bank. Investment protections are often weak. These risks are a primary reason why many investors avoid developing Asia entirely. It is riskier areas, particularly small frontier markets, where China’s BRI is having the greatest impact. Because disputes are so common, there are well-developed avenues for handling them. If mediation fails, parties can seek formal arbitration or litigation. The dispute-resolution process is typically spelled out in trade and investment agreements as well as individual project contracts. After Djibouti terminated its contract, DP World began proceedings in the London Court of International Arbitration. International courts in Hong Kong and Singapore have reportedly seen an increase in cases related to China’s BRI. The International Chamber of Commerce, which helped draft a key instrument in international arbitration known as the New York Convention in the 1950s, recently announced a commission that will make recommendations for responding to BRI disputes. How will China’s new courts compete with these existing venues? The essence of its sales pitch may sound similar to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which Beijing assured skeptics would be “lean, clean, and green.” Existing dispute resolution processes can be costly and time-consuming. Expect promises that the Chinese courts will move faster while still maintaining all the impartiality and fairness of their international counterparts. To be sure, Beijing has identified a need, but it is unclear how the market will respond to its untested solution. Beijing’s most persuasive tool is not reason but resources. Dangling attractive infrastructure loans in many areas that lack viable alternatives, China has successfully persuaded countries to accept terms that would otherwise be difficult to swallow. The contract behind a troubled highway project in Montenegro, for example, not only gives Chinese workers the lion’s share of the work but also requires any disputes to be settled in Chinese courts. International companies are likely to find those requirements too risky. But perhaps that, too, is part of the strategy for favoring Chinese firms. Above all, the BRI courts underscore how China is working to revise the current rules-based order. Initially at least, the courts will focus on disputes between commercial investors rather than between states or between investors and states. But given the BRI’s tendency to expand—now stretching to the Arctic, cyberspace, and outer space since its announcement in 2013—the ambitions of its courts might grow as well. As more BRI projects break ground, China would naturally prefer to play by its own rules rather than abide by the status quo. The implications for U.S. interests are not merely commercial but also strategic, as the ongoing dispute in Djibouti illustrates. By making itself more central in the dispute settlement process, Beijing will have more influence to gain access to, and control of, strategic assets. When projects fail, it will be better positioned to protect its own interests and shift losses onto its partners. It could also demand onerous terms for repayment. Beijing casts itself as lender and builder to all along the Belt and Road. But if its courts succeed, it could become judge and jury.

40,2013,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/analyzing-latest-xi-putin-meeting-and-chinas-belt-and-road-forum,en,"Analyzing the Latest Xi-Putin Meeting and China’s Belt and Road Forum From October 17–18, China hosted the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation to mark 10 years of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). While the forum itself was significant and warrants analyzing, one of the most noteworthy aspects of the forum was a meeting on the sidelines between Chinese president Xi Jinping and Russian president Vladimir Putin. This marks their first meeting since Xi’s trip to Moscow in March 2023, and it is Putin’s first trip to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Together, the Xi-Putin meeting and the BRI forum provide valuable insights into China’s foreign policies. What the Xi-Putin Meeting Reveals about China-Russia Relations This latest meeting between Xi and Putin comes amid growing concerns among the United States and its allies about deepening strategic alignment between Beijing and Moscow. While China has not taken drastic steps to aid Russia’s war in Ukraine—such as providing Russia with lethal military aid—Beijing has gone to great lengths to prop up Russia diplomatically and economically. In September 2023, monthly trade between the two countries reached a record high of $21.2 billion, up nearly 60 percent from the same period two years earlier. Xi and Putin have maintained a close relationship since Xi came to power in 2012. This latest meeting is their 42nd to date. In total, Xi has met with Putin more than twice as many times as any other world leader. Beijing earmarked Putin for special treatment during the forum. In the official group photos of heads of state and government, Putin is always positioned beside Xi, and one video posted online shows Xi and Putin walking side by side, noticeably ahead of the other dignitaries. The official Chinese readout of the Xi-Putin meeting states that Xi “held talks” (会谈) with Putin. Chile’s Gabriel Boric and Indonesia’s Joko Widodo were the only others to receive that distinction; several other leaders were described as only “meeting” (会见) with Xi. The readout of the Xi-Putin meeting was brief, but several aspects are worth noting. First, Xi doubled down on the importance of strengthening China-Russia relations. Xi stated that “developing the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination with ever-lasting good neighborliness and mutually beneficial cooperation is not an expediency, but a long-term commitment.” Xi’s emphasis on “long-term commitment” counters arguments that the China-Russia relationship is a marriage of convenience. Notably, Xi did not use the term “new era” (新时代) when describing the China-Russia partnership, despite that phrase being officially stamped onto the moniker of the upgraded relationship in 2019. However, he did emphasize the need for both countries to grasp the trajectory of history, and Putin voiced his view that Xi was correct in his judgement that “the world is undergoing changes unseen in a century.” Xi and Putin both mentioned that the two countries will mark 75 years of diplomatic relations in 2024 and advocated for advancing relations next year. A deepening or upgrading of China-Russia relations next year could strengthen Beijing’s position in a potentially difficult year. Beijing is worried about the larger geopolitical impacts of the two conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and is concerned that U.S.-China relations could deteriorate in 2024 because of dynamics associated with the U.S. and Taiwan presidential elections. Second, Xi and Putin each offered support to the other for challenges they faced at home and abroad. Without directly addressing Russia’s war in Ukraine or the failed Wagner coup, the readout indicates Xi stated that “China supports [the] people of Russia in following their choice of path to national rejuvenation and in safeguarding sovereignty, security and development interests of the country.” Reciprocating PRC support for Russian rejuvenation, Putin reaffirmed Russia’s commitment to “one China” and Taiwan as part of China, and support for protecting China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Finally, the readout shows that both leaders are committed to broader international cooperation. Xi discussed the recent historic expansion of the BRICS and expressed PRC support for Russia’s hosting of the BRICS leadership summit. He also made clear China’s desire to work with Russia within the United Nations, Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), and G20 and to work together on food, energy, and supply chain security. Putin echoed Xi’s desire to cooperate within the BRICS and “other multilateral mechanisms,” but interestingly the readout did not indicate that he specifically spelled out cooperation in the United Nations, SCO, or G20. The two leaders also held an “in-depth exchange of views on the Palestinian-Israeli situation.” In addition to the publicized bilateral meeting, which was attended by high-level officials on both sides, Putin revealed that he and Xi also had a private conversation over tea that lasted an “hour and a half, maybe two hours.” According to Putin, this private discussion was held at Xi’s suggestion, and the two had “very productive and informative” conversations on “very confidential” topics. Official Chinese media has not acknowledged this private session, and it is not included in the official readout of Xi and Putin’s meeting. Unpacking the Belt and Road Forum The Xi-Putin meeting took place on the sidelines of the third BRI forum. Launched in 2013, the BRI is Xi Jinping’s signature foreign policy initiative aimed at strengthening China’s connectivity with the world through hard and soft infrastructure development and people-to-people exchanges. By some statistics, China could argue that the BRI has been a success. As of October 2023, 151 countries have signed onto the BRI. Together, those countries—which are overwhelmingly developing countries—have a combined population of some 5.1 billion people and a collective GDP of roughly $41 trillion. The willingness of these countries to join the BRI has been a source of pride and legitimacy for China on the world stage. Yet the BRI has faced significant hurdles. The Covid-19 pandemic and China’s ongoing economic slowdown at home have had a dampening effect. In 2022, the combined value of Chinese overseas investment and construction projects in BRI countries was down over 44 percent from their high in 2018. On top of this, BRI skepticism has grown as many BRI projects have faced implementation problems and as geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Western countries have heated up. In recent months, the administration of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has publicly floated its interest in withdrawing Italy from the BRI with the goal of retooling its economic relationship with Beijing to put Italy on a more equal footing. Although most countries have not withdrawn from the BRI, there is dampened interest in the PRC-led effort and what benefits it can deliver. These dynamics were on display at this year’s BRI forum. Only 23 heads of state or government attended this year, down from 29 at the 2017 forum and 37 at the 2019 gathering. Top leaders from several South and Southeast Asian countries did not attend, including Brunei, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, the Philippines, and Singapore—despite having attended the 2019 forum. Leaders from multiple Central Asian countries (Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan) skipped as well. Many European leaders were likewise conspicuously absent. Hungarian president Viktor Orbán was the only leader from an EU state in attendance, whereas in 2019, top leaders from Austria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Greece, Italy, and Portugal (plus Belarus and Switzerland) were present. Recognizing international criticism against the BRI, the week before the forum, China’s State Council released a white paper on the BRI, touting the initiative’s successes of the last decade. It specifically sought to counter widespread concerns about the accountability and transparency of BRI projects, emphasizing that the initiative is “committed to open, green and clean cooperation towards inclusive and sustainable development,” and adding that it has “zero tolerance for corruption.” In contrast to the early years of the BRI, which focused heavily on large-scale megaprojects, the white paper put significant emphasis on digital connectivity, cooperation on science and technology, and shifting toward “green and low-carbon development.” In his keynote speech at the forum, Xi Jinping announced eight broad areas of commitments that embody the shifting priorities foreshadowed in the white paper (see table below). This included commitments to deepening cooperation in green infrastructure, green energy, and green transportation. On the technology front, Xi committed China to promoting technology cooperation by increasing the number of joint laboratories built with other countries. Xi’s speech includes a specific focus on artificial intelligence (AI) with the announcement that China will establish a Global Initiative for AI Governance. Setting the rules for use and development of AI has been a topic of discussion in high-level U.S.-China dialogues, and Xi’s new initiative seeks to ensure that China takes the lead in defining the new rules. China is casting its AI initiative as “inclusive” and based on “mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit,” but real questions remain, including whether this new initiative will suffer similar problems in implementation and whether PRC sharing of AI technologies will further empower PRC-friendly governments to increase surveillance and control of their citizens. While Xi signaled new areas of focus for the BRI, it is clear Beijing intends to continue some of the key infrastructure connectivity projects. In his speech, Xi mentioned China would continue to develop the China-Europe Railway Express and participate in the trans-Caspian international transportation corridor. He also committed the China Development Bank and Export-Import Bank to setting up a RMB 350 billion financing window and said that China would contribute another RMB 80 billion to the Silk Road Fund. More broadly, Xi’s speech sought to cast China as a global champion of internationalism and globalization in contrast to the United States and its partners. While not mentioning countries specifically, he indirectly criticized Western efforts to “de-risk” their economies from China, stating, “Viewing others’ development as a threat or taking economic interdependence as a risk will not make one’s own life better or speed up one’s development.” Bonny Lin is director of the China Power Project and a senior fellow for Asian security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C.

41,2013,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/building-chinas-one-belt-one-road,en,"Building China’s “One Belt, One Road” On March 28, China’s top economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), released a new action plan outlining key details of Beijing’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative. Chinese president Xi Jinping has made the program a centerpiece of both his foreign policy and domestic economic strategy. Initially billed as a network of regional infrastructure projects, this latest release indicates that the scope of the “Belt and Road” initiative has continued to expand and will now include promotion of enhanced policy coordination across the Asian continent, financial integration, trade liberalization, and people-to-people connectivity. China’s efforts to implement this initiative will likely have an important effect on the region’s economic architecture—patterns of regional trade, investment, infrastructure development—and in turn have strategic implications for China, the United States, and other major powers. Q1: What is the “One Belt, One Road,” and what is in the new plan? A1: The “Silk Road Economic Belt” and “21st Century Maritime Silk Road” are initiatives first introduced by Xi in the fall of 2013 during visits to Kazakhstan and Indonesia, respectively. They are expected to feature prominently in China’s 13th Five-Year Plan, which will run from 2016 to 2020 and guide national investment strategy throughout that period. Often referred to jointly as the “One Belt, One Road,” details released so far by China’s official media outlets show the “Belt” as a planned network of overland road and rail routes, oil and natural gas pipelines, and other infrastructure projects that will stretch from Xi’an in central China, through Central Asia, and ultimately reach as far as Moscow, Rotterdam, and Venice. Perhaps awkwardly named, the “Road” is its maritime equivalent: a network of planned port and other coastal infrastructure projects that dot the map from South and Southeast Asia to East Africa and the northern Mediterranean Sea. The new Belt and Road plan, jointly released by the NDRC and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Commerce, highlights that the scope of the initiative will extend well beyond infrastructure construction. The program will also include efforts to promote greater financial integration and use of the Renminbi by foreign countries, create an “Information Silk Road” linking regional information and communications technology networks, and lower barriers to cross-border trade and investment in the region, among other initiatives. New regional institutions, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and New Silk Road Fund (NSRF), are also designed in part to complement and support the Belt and Road’s development. The plan is also notable for its mixing of traditional Chinese diplomatic language (e.g., emphasizing sovereignty and nonintervention) alongside a newer rhetorical focus on adherence to high standards and international norms and the “decisive” role of the market and industry in driving the initiative. This echoes the pledge made by China’s leadership at the November 2013 Third Plenum to “give the market a decisive role in resource allocation,” but it remains to be seen whether or not market forces and commercial considerations will in fact play a critical role in driving the new Silk Road forward. Q2: What is Beijing trying to achieve with this initiative? A2: There are important economic and geopolitical drivers of the initiative, though Beijing is likely more focused on the former at present given its domestic economic challenges. Specifically, the Chinese leadership is struggling to manage a difficult transition to a “new normal” of slower and more sustainable economic growth. The infrastructure projects proposed as part of the Belt and Road—many of which would run through some of China’s poorest and least developed regions—could provide stimulus to help cushion the effects of this deepening slowdown. Beijing is also hoping that, by improving connectivity between its underdeveloped southern and western provinces, its richer coast, and the countries along its periphery, the Belt and Road will improve China’s internal economic integration and competitiveness and spur more regionally balanced growth. Moreover, the construction is intended to help make use of China’s enormous industrial overcapacity and ease the entry of Chinese goods into regional markets. At a time when many large state-owned enterprises are struggling to stay afloat and banks are stuck in a cycle of rolling over ever-growing and progressively less viable loan portfolios, the projects that make up the Belt and Road could provide vital life support and serve as a useful patronage tool for compensating vested interests threatened by efforts to implement market-oriented reforms. On the foreign policy front, the Belt and Road reflects many of the priorities Xi Jinping identified at a major Chinese Communist Party gathering on foreign affairs held last November. These included a heightened focus on improving diplomacy with neighboring states and more strategic use of economics as part of China’s overall diplomatic toolkit. Against the backdrop of a regional “infrastructure gap” estimated in the trillions of dollars, the initiative highlights China’s enormous and growing resources and will provide a major financial carrot to incentivize governments in Asia to pursue greater cooperation with Beijing. Over the medium to long term, successful implementation of the initiative could help deepen regional economic integration, boost cross-border trade and financial flows between Eurasian countries and the outside world, and further entrench Sino-centric patterns of trade, investment, and infrastructure. This would strengthen China’s importance as an economic partner for its neighbors and, potentially, enhance Beijing’s diplomatic leverage in the region. Increased investment in energy and mineral resources, particularly in Central Asia, could also help reduce China’s reliance on commodities imported from overseas, including oil transiting the Strait of Malacca. Q3: Does this initiative involve a free trade area or the creation of another kind of international institution? A3: No, this is clearly not a regional free trade area, and it involves no binding state-to-state agreements. Instead, it is at its heart a pledge by China to use its economic resources and diplomatic skill to promote infrastructure investment and economic development that more closely links China to the rest of Asia and onward to Europe. In this regard, it reflects China’s preference to avoid if possible formal treaties with measurable compliance requirements in favor of less formal arrangements that give it flexibility and allow it to maximize its economic and political skills. Q4: What are the potential benefits to Asia? A4: The “One Belt, One Road” has been referred to as China’s version of the Marshall Plan, a comparison Beijing has sought to downplay as being freighted with geopolitical undertones that it claims are absent in its initiative. Motivations aside, the initiative is a powerful illustration of China’s growing capacity and economic clout—and the Xi administration’s intent to deploy them abroad. Properly implemented, the projects that comprise the Belt and Road could help enhance regional economic growth, development, and integration. According to the Asian Development Bank, there is an annual “gap” between the supply and demand for infrastructure spending in Asia on the order of $800 billion. Given that infrastructure is at the heart of the Belt and Road, there is room for the initiative to play a constructive role in regional economic architecture. In addition, if this leads to more sustainable and inclusive growth, it could help strengthen the political institutions in the region and reduce the incentives and opportunities for terrorist movements. Q5: What are the potential risks? A5: Implementing the Belt and Road will entail significant risks and challenges for China and its neighbors. Beijing’s past difficulties investing in infrastructure abroad, especially through bilateral arrangements, suggest that many of the proposed projects could well end up as little more than a series of expensive boondoggles. Given Chinese construction companies’ poor track record operating in foreign countries (including frequent mistreatment of local workers), a major increase in the scale of their external activities increases the risk of damaging political blowback that could harm Beijing’s image or lead to instability in host countries—particularly if the efforts do not generate lasting benefits for local economies. Enhanced regional connectivity might also increase the likelihood of the consequences of poor conduct abroad finding their way back to China. Another risk is that many countries in Asia and abroad (including the United States) are concerned about the geopolitical impact of the Belt and Road. Although Beijing has sought to allay these concerns in its latest plan, stressing the “win-win” potential of the initiative, its efforts will have important foreign policy implications for a number of key regional players, including Japan, India, and Russia. Moscow is particularly concerned about the initiative translating into increased Chinese influence in Central Asia, an area it has long viewed as within its sphere of influence and where Sino-Russia competition has been noticeably intensifying of late. Meanwhile, India has been especially alarmed by Chinese investments in Sri Lanka, which New Delhi likewise views as part of its backyard. Hence, there is a clear risk that Beijing’s efforts—well-intentioned or not—will heighten geopolitical tensions in an already tense region. There are also direct security implications of the project. The Maritime Silk Road in particular will likely expand China’s capacity to project its growing naval power abroad, while increased Chinese involvement in building regional information technology infrastructure could create new channels for Beijing to exert its influence in the region. Alternatively, there is a substantial chance that these lofty plans will not come to fruition. China’s development strategy of “build it and they will come” has already run into difficulty at home. Should the same thing happen abroad, it could generate not only political backlash against China, but borrowers’ failure to pay back their loans, or businesses’ inability to recoup their investments could end up placing additional stress on the Chinese economy rather helping to marginally ease a deepening slowdown.

42,2013,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-belt-and-road-full-holes,en,"China's Belt and Road Is Full Of Holes Available Downloads The Issue Five years since it was announced, China’s massive Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has yet to materialize on the ground as promised. According to Chinese officials, the BRI includes six economic corridors that will carry goods, people, and data across the Eurasian supercontinent. But a statistical analysis of 173 infrastructure projects finds that Chinese investment is just as likely to go outside those corridors as within them. The BRI appears to be less coordinated than Beijing hopes and some critics fear. High Road, Low Road: Incomplete Views of the Belt and Road Initiative Since President Xi Jinping announced it five years ago, China’s BRI has been equally captivating and frustrating for analysts. Its sheer scale demands attention. Spanning roughly 80 countries, it can claim to cover more than two-thirds of the world’s population. It could include Chinese investments approaching $1 trillion, seven times what the United States spent under the Marshall Plan. It intends to strengthen hard infrastructure with new roads and railways, soft infrastructure with trade and transportation agreements, and even cultural ties with university scholarships and other people-to-people exchanges. In all these ways, when much of the West is looking inward, China is connecting with the world. Figure 1: China’s Belt and Road Initiative The BRI is also breathtakingly ambiguous. There is no official definition for what qualifies as a BRI project. There are Chinese-funded projects in countries not participating in the BRI that share many of the same characteristics. The BRI was officially launched in 2013, but projects started years earlier are often counted. The BRI brand has been extended to fashion shows, art exhibits, marathons, domestic flights, dentistry, and other unrelated activities. The BRI’s loose, ever-expanding nature, and a lack of project transparency, have led many observers to exaggerate its size. When assessing the BRI, there is always a risk of imposing order where, by design, it does not exist. Beijing’s priorities should be reflected in its project activities on the ground. Given these challenges, most scholars trying to make sense of the BRI have taken one of two approaches. The most common approach has been to examine the BRI at a relatively high level, evaluating Chinese official statements and documents and often underscoring how the BRI serves China’s broader economic and foreign policy objectives. A second and smaller group has taken a more granular approach that evaluates drivers and implications of individual projects. With few exceptions, there has been a dearth of mid-level analysis that links developments on the ground with larger economic and strategic considerations. As a result, there is no consensus about whether the BRI is achieving its objectives. This study begins to fill that gap by evaluating Chinese infrastructure investment in the BRI’s six economic corridors. Although the framing is conceptual, and the method is technical, the goal is practical. Investment patterns are an important indicator of whether actual activities are following official priorities. The findings should interest BRI supporters and critics alike. Supporters often underscore the BRI’s ability to link countries for mutual gain, and corridors are an often-cited vehicle for achieving those connections. Critics often assume, implicitly or explicitly, that Chinese officials have a high degree of control over the BRI. If these views are correct, Beijing’s priorities should be reflected in its project activities on the ground. Corridors: A Middle View Chinese officials have proposed six economic corridors, summarized in Figure 2 below, which provide a mid-level window into the BRI. These corridors are outlined in the BRI’s foundational policy documents, comments by individual officials, maps, and articles publicized by Chinese state media. As President Xi underscored at the Belt and Road Forum in May 2017, “Infrastructure connectivity is the foundation of development through cooperation. We should promote land, maritime, air and cyberspace connectivity, concentrate our efforts on key passageways, cities and projects and connect networks of highways, railways and seaports. The goal of building six major economic corridors under the Belt and Road Initiative has been set, and we should endeavor to meet it.” Economic corridors are hardly unique to the BRI. As a concept, they gained popularity in the 1980s and 1990s, most notably through an Asian Development Bank (ADB) project to develop the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) in Southeast Asia. This geographically-targeted approach to development often begins by connecting cities, industrial centers, and other economic hubs with transportation infrastructure. Complimentary policies, including improvements to “soft” infrastructure, aim to help transportation corridors develop into economic corridors over time. Figure 2: The Belt and Road’s Six Economic Corridors If the BRI is following Beijing’s priorities on the ground, it is reasonable to expect that a higher level of activity will be occurring inside the corridors than outside them. Chinese officials have not provided the exact coordinates for these corridors, which would allow for a more finely-tuned geospatial analysis. But the official statements, documents, and maps referenced earlier make it possible to approximate the countries in each corridor, as Figure 3 summarizes below. With these definitions and project-level data, it is possible to compare project activity levels in countries that fall in a corridor with those falling outside the corridors. Figure 3: Countries in the Belt and Road Corridors Project data was drawn from the CSIS Reconnecting Asia database. The research team maintaining that database uses an open-source methodology, drawing from statements by government agencies, regional development banks, project contracts, news articles, and other public information. Fitch Solutions also shares quarterly updates, which are based on open sources and offered in its Key Projects database. Approximately 380 Chinese-funded projects with varying levels of information were identified. After dropping projects without sufficient information, the analysis included 173 Chinese-funded infrastructure projects initiated between 2013 and 2017 across 45 countries on the Eurasian supercontinent. Western Europe was omitted from the analysis because its transport networks are already developed, and geographically, the region acts as an origin and destination rather than an intermediary linkage. Most of the projects included were transportation projects, which is consistent with the development strategies of past and current economic corridors, as described earlier. Project activity on the ground is not adhering to China’s grand vision. Linear regressions were used to analyze the relationship between project activity and the BRI’s six economic corridors. The total funding and number of projects per country were initially examined as indicators of activity. Due to transparency challenges, funding information could not be confirmed for several projects. The analysis proceeded with project counts as the primary indicator of country-level activity. Several additional country-level variables were included to help control for economic, political, and social factors that may contribute to investment differences: GDP, GDP per capita, land area, population, distance from China, and governance indicators. A variable was also included to help control for having a coastline, which could make a country more likely to receive investment as part of the BRI’s maritime dimension. This analysis is an “easy” test of the BRI’s corridors in two respects. First, if Chinese officials defined each corridor as a specific geographic area within the countries it passes through, then not every project within the country would necessarily be considered part of the corridor. This analysis assumes that all projects in a country are part of the corridors that pass through it. Second, the geographic scope for the analysis is limited to countries on the Eurasian supercontinent. For example, African and Latin American countries were not included in the analysis, even though both areas have Chinese-funded infrastructure projects. Neither region is formally part of the six economic corridors, so leaving them out decreases the relative amounts of funding in non-corridor countries. Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and other maritime-based countries were also excluded for the same reason. These decisions made it more likely that Chinese projects included in the analysis would fall within the corridors. Yet the results suggest that project activity on the ground is not adhering to China’s grand vision. For five of the six corridors, there appears to be no significant relationship between corridor participation and project activity, as summarized in Figure 4 below. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is an outlier in at least two respects. First, CPEC is the only corridor that is significantly correlated with higher levels of project activity. That is logical given that it has often been viewed as the BRI’s flagship corridor. However, it is also the only corridor that connects China with a single country. As the next section explains, rather than serving as a model for the BRI’s other corridors, CPEC could underscore the coordination challenges that China faces in overseeing and implementing the BRI. Figure 4: China’s Struggling Economic Corridors Detour: Beijing’s Control Problem What explains the gap between China’s official plans for the BRI and actual project activities on the ground? The statistical analysis above does not provide an answer, but it opens the door to speculation and further research. Of course, it is possible that Beijing has a private plan for the BRI, and that resources are in fact going toward those priorities. But other than CPEC, the results above do not provide evidence for any set of priorities, geographic (e.g., countries closer to China) or otherwise (e.g., better business environments). Moreover, if such a plan did exist, it would likely encounter many of the same coordination challenges that Beijing’s publicly-articulated priorities appear to be facing, if not more. A more compelling explanation is that that interest groups within and outside China are skewing President Xi’s signature foreign policy vision. Within China, interest groups at the regional, local, and firm level are incentivized to repackage their existing work as supporting the BRI and pursue new activities under the same banner. China’s 32 provinces and regions are jockeying not only for economic gains but also the political spoils that come with advancing President Xi’s initiative. By signaling that the BRI is likely to remain a focal point for years to come, adding the BRI to the Chinese Party Constitution last year made it more likely that “legitimate” activities and rent-seeking will continue under the BRI banner. Interest groups within and outside China are skewing President Xi’s signature foreign policy vision. This competition has led to duplication and waste instead of promoting market efficiencies. From 2011 to 2016, for example, China’s provincial governments collectively spent over $300 million subsidizing China-Europe block trains. Provincial governments were so eager to announce new train services that they were undercutting each other with subsidies. Each new service was named after its local champion, creating a long list of services and confusion among prospective customers. In 2016, the China Railway Company stepped in and announced that all China-Europe trains would be referred to as “China Railway Express.” The BRI’s political economy within China drives its opportunistic expansion beyond China.

Watch the live testimony Introduction Thank you for the opportunity to testify on China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and its implications for U.S. interests. The Commission asked me to focus on the BRI’s economic dimensions. I will address four key questions in this regard: - What are the key trends in BRI projects to date, and to what extent do BRI projects follow market rules and international standards? - What tools has Beijing used to boost Chinese exports under the BRI? - How has the BRI affected China’s trade and investment patterns, its diplomatic reach, and its soft power? - What are the economic implications of the BRI for the United States? After addressing these questions, I will conclude with brief recommendations for Congressional action. Hot Spots and Blind Spots: Key Trends in BRI Projects The BRI is the most ambitious geoeconomic vision in recent history. Spanning some 70 countries, it can claim to cover more than two-thirds of the world’s population. It could include Chinese investments approaching $4 trillion.1 It intends to strengthen hard infrastructure with new roads and railways, soft infrastructure with trade and transportation agreements, and even cultural ties with university scholarships and other people-to-people exchanges. In all these ways, when much of the West is looking inward, China is connecting with the world. The BRI is also the best-known, least-understood foreign policy effort underway. Beyond investments in actual projects, China spends significant resources organizing BRI events, promoting BRI stories, and conducting other outreach. Recognition within and outside China has been growing. Chinese state media claim that global awareness of the BRI has tripled between 2014 and 2017, increasing from 6 percent to 18 percent in a survey of 22 countries.2 Nearly 30 world leaders and representatives from 110 countries and international organizations attended the BRI Forum in May 2017. The event, hosted by President Xi Jinping, received significant global coverage. Attention and awareness continues to climb, especially in the West. In recent weeks, the Financial Times,3 the New York Times,4 and other international outlets have all included reporting on BRI-related projects. But for all the attention the BRI receives, there is little reliable information about how it is unfolding in aggregate. A major challenge is that the BRI label evades classification. There is no agreed-upon definition for what qualifies as a BRI project.5 There are roughly 70 countries participating in the BRI, according to Chinese state media. Yet there are Chinese-funded projects in non-participant countries that share many of the same characteristics. The BRI was officially launched in November 2013, but projects started years earlier are often counted. The BRI banner hangs over a wide and ever-expanding list of activities. There are BRI fashion shows, concerts, and art exhibits. By design, the BRI is more a loose brand than a program with strict criteria. Infrastructure is a major component of the BRI and provides a window into its drivers and broader implications. For three years, the Reconnecting Asia Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has been tracking infrastructure projects across the Eurasian supercontinent. Our website, ReconnectingAsia.CSIS.org, has an interactive map, an open-source database of over 2,200 transportation projects, and expert analysis. To date, this database has focused on transportation projects: road, railroads, seaports, and dry ports. It will expand in the future to include power plants, pipelines, telecommunications, and other connectivity infrastructure. China is not the only focal point of this database, which covers all funders, but it is the most active. As this database grows, several trends are emerging. First, China is often the biggest spender, but it is not the only consequential actor. Across the Eurasian supercontinent, three zones of competition are emerging. In Southeast Asia, Japan is outspending China in several countries. In Central Asia, the Asian Development Bank and other multilateral development banks (MDB) have significant activities underway. In Eastern and Central Europe, European funders remain dominant in many countries. To be sure, this is not a zero-sum contest, and there are numerous projects with both Chinese and MDB funding. These areas will be important to watch as China continues to compete with, and adapt to, other visions for connectivity. Second, Chinese projects are less open to local and international participation. Out of all contractors participating in Chinese-funded projects within the Reconnecting Asia database, 89 percent are Chinese companies, 7.6 percent are local companies (companies headquartered in the same country where the project was taking place), and 3.4 percent are foreign companies (non-Chinese companies from a country other than the one where the project was taking place). In comparison, out of the contractors participating in projects funded by the multilateral development banks, 29 percent are Chinese, 40.8 percent are local, and 30.2 percent are foreign. These findings illuminate some difficult practical and political realities. Practically speaking, it should not come as a surprise that Chinese companies are winning more contracts for Chinese-funded projects. Despite official rhetoric about the BRI being open and global, it is a China-centric effort. Chinese companies are also extremely competitive in the transportation sector. It is possible that Western firms are more competitive in providing related services around these projects, such as consulting and legal services, but further research is needed. China’s advantage also stems from some of the tools it uses, which are explained further in the next section. Third, Chinese projects are less transparent at earlier stages of the project lifecycle. The Reconnecting Asia Project recently ran an experiment that scored the project pages in our database for completeness. Projects with more data fields completed received more points. Scoring was adjusted based on the project status. A project that is just under negotiation, for example, would not be expected to have as much information as a completed project. We found no meaningful difference in the amount of information available for Chinese-funded projects versus projects supported by various multilateral development banks. They all scored in the low to mid 80’s out of 100, roughly B’s and B-minuses. But transparency is tricky. How do you evaluate projects that you cannot find? To get closer to answering that question, we examined the status levels for projects in our database. We have six status levels – beginning with “announced” and ending with “completed” or “cancelled” – and there are some projects for which the status is unknown. What jumped out in this comparison between MDB projects and projects from the China Development Bank is the difference in early stage projects. About 7 percent of our MDB projects are marked as announced, which is the earliest stage in our database. To date, the database does not have any China Development Bank (CDB) projects in the earliest stage (“announced”), and it has a higher percentage of CDB projects that are completed. These trends could change over time. Indeed, it is in everyone’s long-term interest that projects are open and transparent. Greater openness and transparency benefits recipient countries by ensuring the companies participating are the best for the job. If there is little or no information available publicly about early stage projects, it is impossible to have an open and fair competition. Even China stands to benefit over the longer term. Right now, U.S. and other Western firms are genuinely interested in participating in BRI-related projects. But unless there are more opportunities to participate, that interest will wane and suspicion will rise. More countries will start to ask why they joined the BRI, and those that have not joined will not. The Visible Hand: China’s Tools China uses several tools to boost its exports, many of them now falling under the BRI banner: national champions, credit, infrastructure, and trade agreements. Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) often benefit from tremendous scale and subsidies. They have dramatically moved up the global rankings in recent years. In 2000, Fortune’s Global 500 list of the world’s largest companies by revenue included 10 Chinese firms, of which 9 were state-owned.6 In 2017, the list included 107 Chinese firms, of which 75 were state-owned. This trend is especially stark in the construction industry. In 2017, seven of the ten largest construction companies in the world, by revenue, were Chinese.7 When Chinese SOEs compete for foreign contracts, they bring these advantages to the table. Credit is a powerful incentive. According to researchers at William and Mary, Chinese lending during 2000-2014 totaled $354.4 billion, with lending highest in the transport and power sectors.8 Of these loans, about three quarters had commercial terms. China is successful at locking in higher rates because it agrees to assume risks that other lenders will not. In Sri Lanka, which I visited earlier this month, China was willing to provide a $1.3 billion loan for a new port after MDBs declined. After Sri Lanka could not repay the interest on its debt, China agreed to take equity in the port. China is also proactive, offering to pursue projects without solicitation. Its loans to Sri Lanka now exceed $8 billion, a sum that grew as leaders found each project too tempting to turn down.9 Infrastructure projects have short and long-term implications for Chinese exports. In the short term, these projects are aiding Chinese exports of construction-related goods. Chinese exports to Pakistan, for example, increased 77 percent between 2012 and 2015.10 Chinese producers of steel, concrete, and other construction materials stand to benefit from projects that use them, as do Chinese engineering and construction firms. These activities provide important but modest relief for Chinese overcapacity, a problem that will still need to be addressed even if the BRI’s ambitious spending targets are reached. Despite the BRI’s scale, it is too small to solve China’s overcapacity challenges.11 Over the longer term, new infrastructure could facilitate trade by improving connectivity between China and its trading partners. The actual impacts will depend on both macro and micro factors, such as the trajectories of the recipient economies and whether the right projects were selected. There is no question the region needs infrastructure investment. Developing Asia alone requires $26 trillion in infrastructure investment between 2017 and 2030 to maintain current growth rates and adapt to climate change, according to ADB estimates.12 If all that infrastructure appeared tomorrow, flawlessly built where markets required it, there would be large trade gains. But many barriers to trade would still remain, from onerous customs paperwork to divergent standards. Upgrading Asia’s “soft” infrastructure will be important as well. Trade agreements could provide that upgrade, and they have been placed under the BRI banner as well. Chinese officials have described a network of free trade agreements that would support the BRI, but to date, China appears primarily focused on bilateral trade deals.13 Given the diverse list of countries participating in the BRI, a BRI-wide trade agreement is highly unlikely. While lowering barriers between China and individual markets, additional bilateral deals could further complicate a web of rules that firms struggle to navigate, as could the",2013-2017,9,high_conflict
44,2013,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-must-become-strategy,en,"China’s “Belt and Road” Initiative Must Become a Strategy On May 14, President Xi Jinping of China will welcome 28 world leaders to Beijing to discuss the most ambitious and least understood initiative in global affairs: the Belt and Road. The effort is bold and has been compared to a traditional Chinese painting made with broad brush strokes. Through new overland and maritime connections, it aims to put China squarely at the center of global economic affairs. Like a painting of the same style, it also begins to lose focus when viewed up close, raising questions about its drivers and ultimate implications. The Belt and Road is a masterpiece hanging in today’s global affairs gallery. Stagnation has been a watchword for the global economy since 2008, but it also partially describes the foreign policy realm. Lackluster growth, political cycles, and geopolitical crises have relegated states to postures that are more reactive than proactive and, in many cases, more focused internally than externally. What President George H.W. Bush once called ""the vision thing” has never been easy, but with lower growth, executing big ideas has only become more difficult. In contrast, the Belt and Road is the most ambitious geoeconomic vision in recent history. Spanning an estimated 65 countries, it can claim to cover roughly 70 percent of the world’s population. It could include Chinese investments approaching $4 trillion, of which nearly $900 billion in deals have been announced. It intends to strengthen hard infrastructure with new roads and railways, soft infrastructure with trade and transportation agreements, and even cultural ties with university scholarships and other people-to-people exchanges. In all these ways, when much of the West is looking inward, China is connecting with the world. But is this vision achievable? Tellingly, China has issued guidance on English equivalents for describing the Belt and Road. These instructions specify that it should be called an “initiative” and explicitly reject the term “strategy.” An initiative has the benefit of being viewed as less threatening, more open ended, and more inclusive than a strategy. But it also lacks the focus, coherence, and substance of a real strategy. The distinction between initiative and strategy is more than simple semantics. It captures the central challenge the Belt and Road faces. Since its birth in 2013, the Belt and Road has taken on a growing list of objectives. One official document outlines five major goals: policy coordination, facilities connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration, and people-to-people bonds. In theory, each of these is a worthwhile objective. They all relate to connectivity and, in many situations, could be mutually beneficial and reinforcing. But they can also conflict. New trade and financial connections create winners and losers, and adjustment costs can impact people-to-people bonds. A Belt and Road strategy would include guidance for making trade-offs between goals. There is also a gap between these overarching goals and the smaller issues that Belt and Road statements often discuss. A single sentence in the same document, for example, lists 16 areas for cooperation. It is unclear how deeper cooperation on “ocean engineering technology,” to mention one of those areas, fits with the Belt and Road’s broader vision. Desired outcomes are not specified. Is the goal to invent better ocean engineering technology, restrict or expand its use, or something else? This is the space that good strategy fills, explicitly connecting ends and means. As an open-ended framework, the Belt and Road has wide support, but its power as a vehicle for regional integration is unclear. In some respects, it is a new banner for existing bilateral efforts. For example, China is aiming to complete trade agreements with 40 percent of Belt and Road participants by the end of 2017. But Asia is already a sea of bilateral trade deals. Many companies lack the capacity to navigate this maze of rules, and consequently, utilization rates are very low. Similarly, China has signed 130 transportation agreements. Some of these efforts could eventually be consolidated. It would be encouraging to see the Belt and Road move toward a more multilateral approach, unifying some of these related but fragmented efforts. Another quality of good strategy is that it does not depend on what one scholar terms “fluff.” The Belt and Road is often described in exciting but vague terms. For example, it is advertised as a “new vision of innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development.” Of course, buzzwords are a mainstay of policy statements around the world. Sometimes, fluff compensates for a lack of substance. It is also an essential weapon in the diplomat’s arsenal. There is an art to avoiding stating something uncomfortable or simply to “say something” when silence is not an option. The downside of lofty rhetoric is that it can raise questions about substance and intentions. Letting others fill in the details not only raises questions but also leads to operational inefficiencies. With large investments at stake, central and local governments, private firms, and nonprofit organizations are incentivized to repackage their work around the Belt and Road. There are now over 100 think tanks studying the Belt and Road. There are Belt and Road fashion shows, music festivals, and cartoon exhibits. Part of the Belt and Road’s brilliance is how it strongly aligns with China’s domestic economic interests. But clearer priorities would help minimize waste and guard against rent seeking. To succeed, the Belt and Road initiative must become a strategy. A Belt and Road strategy would not only benefit China but also the broader international community. It would focus on a narrower range of objectives and set priorities so resources are used more efficiently. It would embrace and enforce clear standards. It would use lofty rhetoric sparingly. In becoming a strategy, the Belt and Road could also become a better vehicle for regional integration and, ultimately, contribute more to the global economy. It is not too late. By one account, the Belt and Road has not even started its implementation stage, which runs from 2022 to 2049. It is currently in the “strategic planning” stage. In an age of short-term pressures, this long view is another remarkable feature of the Belt and Road. At a time when governments are operating from one budget resolution to the next, and companies from one quarter to the next, China has set its eyes on the middle of the century. Putting forward a decades-long vision for global connectivity takes courage, particularly in today’s low-growth environment. Getting there will require a strategy.

The MSR is the maritime complement to the Silk Road Economic Belt, which focuses on infrastructure development across Central Asia. Together these initiatives form the One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative designed to enhance China’s influence across Asia. There is a shortage of infrastructure investment to meet the needs of developing nations across the Indo-Asia-Pacific region and most nations have welcomed the opportunity to bid for Chinese funding. At the same time, there are growing questions about the economic viability and the geopolitical intentions behind China’s proposals. Thus far MSR initiatives have mainly been concentrated in the littoral states of the Indo-Pacific region, especially port-development projects, which is raising questions about whether these investments are economic or military in nature. These large-scale investments are also structured in ways that invite questions about the potential for China to exert undo leverage over the domestic and foreign policies of heavily indebted recipient countries. To shed light on some of these themes, CSIS has commissioned seven experts to unpack the economic and geostrategic implications of China’s infrastructure development across the Indo-Pacific region under the MSR. Their research is presented in this volume. The essays begin with analysis of four infrastructure projects, three by China under MSR and one by India as a counter to MSR. These are: Kyaukpyu (Myanmar), Hambantota (Sri Lanka), Gwadar (Pakistan), and Chabahar (Iran): - Kyaukpyu: Greg Poling explains the economic and strategic rationale behind China’s investments in Kyaukpyu, a coastal town along the Bay of Bengal in Myanmar’s western-most state of Rakhine. China recently won contracts to develop a deep-sea port at Kyaukpyu and an industrial area in a special economic zone (SEZ) nearby. Kyaukpyu is also the terminus for an oil pipeline and a parallel natural gas pipeline running to Kunming, capital of southwestern China’s Yunnan Province. Those projects reflect a strategic effort by Beijing to reduce its reliance on oil and gas imports through the Strait of Malacca, and a deep-sea port at Kyaukpyu could similarly help China in its drive to develop its inland provinces. Poling references regional concerns about the potential that China would leverage a port at Kyaukpyu for military purposes but concludes that at present the overriding fear within Myanmar is China’s potential economic leverage via debt financing. - Hambantota: Jonathan Hillman examines China’s development of the Hambantota port in Sri Lanka and questions the economic rationale of this project given existing capacity and expansion plans at Colombo port, fueling concerns that Hambantota could become a Chinese naval facility. This case also highlights the potential risks of becoming a debt trap as Sri Lanka handed the port over to China in December 2017 with a controlling equity stake and a 99-year lease—eerily similar to the imperial strategies Britain imposed on Qing China with Hong Kong in the Nineteenth Century. Hillman suggests the Hambantota case reveals the need for recipient countries to tie infrastructure projects to larger development strategies in order to better monitor debt levels, and for the international community to expand alternatives to Chinese infrastructure financing. - Gwadar: Gurmeet Kanwal highlights the development of Gwadar port as a key element in the larger China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative. Though CPEC is branded as a symbol of strong bilateral ties between China and Pakistan, Kanwal argues that both sides have misgivings about the project, including China’s concern about the safety of its workers and fears in Pakistan about increased indebtedness resulting from the project, that could increase tensions. Kanwal also addresses the security implications of China’s potential naval access to Gwadar as a gateway to the Indo-Pacific, and concludes by examining the potential from the revived quadrilateral framework of security dialogue and cooperation among India, Japan, Australia, and the United States as a way to counter China’s strategic outreach. - Chabahar: Harsh Pant notes that China is not the only country playing the great game through infrastructure investment. India’s efforts to help develop Iran’s Chabahar Port reflect Delhi’s own ambitions as a driver of infrastructure development and improved regional connectivity, particularly with Afghanistan. Close to the Chinese-backed, Pakistani port of Gwadar, the Chabahar project is also seen as a strategic play to limit the influence China seeks to gain and wield through its Belt and Road Initiative and MSR. Pant concludes by identifying complications in India’s strategy stemming from Iran’s openness to Chinese and Pakistani participation in the development of Chabahar. These four infrastructure case studies are followed by two essays addressing the broader economic and military implications of China’s MSR initiative: - Economic Implications: Matthew Funaiole and Jonathan Hillman begin their chapter by framing the larger economic significance of the Indo-Pacific region, noting for example that each of the 10 busiest container ports in the world are along the shores of either the Pacific or the Indian Ocean, and more than half of the world’s maritime trade in petroleum transits the Indian Ocean alone. In order to begin addressing whether China’s infrastructure investments serve economic or strategic purposes—or both—the authors introduce three criteria for assessing the economic viability of infrastructure development projects: proximity to shipping lanes; proximity to existing ports; and hinterland connectivity, or the degree to which port projects are connected to larger development strategies inland (though some ports can arguably serve meaningful economic purposes as hubs for cargo transshipment). In their view, all three of the Chinese infrastructure projects examined in this volume are somewhat misaligned with economic objectives, particularly with respect to the third criterion of connectivity. - Military Implications: Zack Cooper posits that China’s increased military presence in the Indian Ocean should not come as a surprise. China is following in the traditional path of other rising powers; it is expanding its military operations to match its interests abroad. The Chinese economy is highly reliant on trade routes that pass through the Indian Ocean, which serves as a vital pathway, particularly for energy supplies, and it is therefore natural for the Chinese government to seek to protect its interests along these sea lines of communication. In his view, the security implications of China’s push into the Indian Ocean are mixed. In peacetime, these efforts will certainly expand Chinese influence in the region, possibly through access to port facilities to refuel or resupply naval vessels and in terms of anti-piracy operations and familiarization with other regional militaries. At the same time, however, China’s Indian Ocean presence will likely create as many vulnerabilities as opportunities in terms of protecting trade routes, bases, and ships—particularly in wartime. Nevertheless, Beijing’s political, economic, and military influence is likely to expand in future years and will remain a concern for strategists focused on the Indian Ocean, which has long been seen by the United States and Australia as a critical transit point from the Pacific to the Middle East and critical for maritime defense in depth to manage any threats to the critical chokepoints of the Gulf of Hormuz and the Strait of Malacca. These concerns are increasingly on Japan’s radar and India has also grown concerned that China’s so-called “string of pearls” in the Indian Ocean would give Beijing new options to horizontally escalate beyond long-standing Sino-Indian competition in the Himalayas. The series concludes by examining how the maritime democracies of the United States, Japan, India, and Australia might respond to the uncertainties posed by the MSR through the newly reconstituted “Quad.” - Quad Response: Jesse Barker Gale and Andrew Shearer review the history of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or “Quad,” which began when Australia, Japan, India, and the United States first came together to provide humanitarian assistance after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. In subsequent years, the four governments failed to formalize the construct because of differences within each capital about China’s possible reaction. Fast-forward a decade, and the four countries have now reestablished the Quad in what the authors consider a response to China’s unexpected economic and military assertiveness in the region. They argue that with increasing convergence among the four maritime democracies on the need to coordinate on a broader strategy to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific region, the “Quad 2.0” has potential to shape China’s strategy in a more benign direction, but remains underutilized and under-operationalized. This study builds on prior work at CSIS on the geopolitics of the Indo-Pacific, including: the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative; Reconnecting Asia; China Power; and Countering Coercion in Maritime Asia. The idea for a focused examination of China’s Maritime Silk Road grew out of discussions with senior leadership on Japan’s National Security Council staff, who then provided some funding for a conference on the subject. As with our other research on maritime Asia, we have endeavored to integrate political, military, economic, and historical considerations. The analysis and prescriptions are entirely those of the authors and do not represent the official positions of any government in the region. The overall conclusion is mixed. China’s MSR projects are neither purely military nor purely commercial. Moreover, China’s overall approach is probably evolving. It is our hope that this study will help the United States and like-minded states refine their own response to MSR—hedging or deterring where necessary, but also working to encourage a more transparent and economically viable approach from Beijing. I am grateful to the authors for their expertise and careful work and to Nick Szechenyi for leading the project and pulling together the essays for this study. Michael J.

46,2013,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-second-belt-and-road-forum,en,"China’s Second Belt and Road Forum On April 25-27, President Xi Jinping will welcome leaders from 37 countries and delegates from over 150 countries at the second Belt and Road forum in Beijing. Chinese officials aim to use the gathering to help repair the Belt and Road Initiative’s (BRI) brand—which scandals have tarnished since the first forum in May 2017—but promises for reform will require further monitoring and scrutiny. Q1: What is China’s BRI? A1: China’s BRI is Xi’s signature foreign policy vision and consists of two main components: an overland Silk Road Economic Belt connecting China with Central Asia and beyond and an ocean-based 21st Century Maritime Silk Road to China’s south. Announced in 2013 and enshrined in the Communist Party Constitution in 2017, it aims to put China at the center of global economic affairs through improving hard infrastructure, soft infrastructure, and even cultural ties. Although the BRI looks like a grand strategy on aspirational maps, on the ground, it has been shaped and skewed by a host of competing actors. There have been no criteria for what qualifies as a BRI project, allowing interest groups within and outside China to repackage their own efforts as supporting the initiative. Reflecting these dynamics, the BRI has grown since its announcement to include activities in the Arctic, cyberspace, and even outer space. Over 125 countries have signed BRI cooperation documents according to Chinese state media, but participation is no guarantee of benefits, which have ranged greatly. Given its ambiguity, the BRI’s size and scope are often misinterpreted. Guesstimates for BRI-related spending have ranged as high as $8 trillion, but a closer look suggests that even China’s promise to provide $1 trillion of infrastructure beyond its borders has not yet been met. The BRI is often compared to the Marshall Plan, through which the United States helped rebuild Western European economies after World War II. But unlike the Marshall Plan, the BRI has been open-ended, less centrally controlled, and focused primarily on developing economies, where governance is weaker and investment risks are higher. Q2: What does Xi hope to accomplish at the forum? A2: Scandals have damaged the BRI brand since the first forum in May 2017, and Xi will be aiming to repair it. Outside observers, as well as China’s partners, have raised concerns about corruption, debt sustainability, environmental impacts, and local benefits, as well as questioning China’s underlying strategic aims. High-profile projects in Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Montenegro, and elsewhere have undercut the BRI’s promise to deliver “win-win” outcomes, appearing to benefit China at the expense of its partners. The forum provides an opportunity to demonstrate that China is adapting the BRI to address these concerns. One draft communique, for example, includes new language on debt sustainability and environmental concerns. Chinese officials are considering steps to improve project selection and assert greater control of the BRI, including adopting criteria for BRI projects. Beijing also wants to attract more partners to finance BRI projects, helping it share the burden for backing projects and the reputational risk when things go wrong. Chinese officials can also point to the BRI’s expanding roster, particularly recent additions in Europe. Recent symbolic victories include Italy signing an MOU and Greece joining China’s regional grouping for Central and Eastern Europe. Switzerland has announced that it will sign an MOU as well. But Europe’s three largest economies— the UK, Germany, and France—have resisted pressure to join, and there are indications that the EU is preparing to mount a stronger response to Chinese investments within the EU and its backyard. Q3: Is this a new phase for the BRI? A3: China’s promises for a revamped BRI will require further monitoring and scrutiny. Real changes will not be easy because they involve costs for China. Ensuring that projects deliver more local benefits, by hiring more local workers, for example, means hiring fewer Chinese workers. Bringing in more outside partners could mean less control over project specifics. Increasing transparency will make it harder to favor certain firms and funnel money to friends in high places. While it is encouraging that Chinese officials are talking more openly about prioritizing debt sustainability and environmental sustainability, real change will require more than signing symbolic documents. These promises are politically expedient but will remain empty without greater transparency and enforcement. Q4: How should the United States respond? A4: The best U.S. response to China’s BRI is not a response at all, but a compelling U.S. economic vision, resourced strategically and sustained over time. The world needs more infrastructure than any single state can provide, and disenchantment with China’s BRI provides an opportunity for the United States to work with its partners and allies to deliver high-quality infrastructure. Seizing that opportunity, a new report by the CSIS Global Infrastructure Task Force , The Higher Road, proposes seven recommendations and specific implementation steps for advancing U.S. interests, including focusing on strategic sectors, working with partners and allies, and catalyzing private sector investment.

47,2013,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinese-multilateralism-and-promise-green-belt-and-road,en,"Chinese Multilateralism and the Promise of a Green Belt and Road Available Downloads THE ISSUE As China comes under increased scrutiny over its global energy investments, Chinese authorities have announced a series of multilateral initiatives to “green” its Belt and Road initiative (BRI). Of these, the BRI International Green Development Coalition and the Green Investment Principles for the Belt and Road Development show the most promise, yet they are in danger of failing to deliver on their stated goals. As long as investors on the ground only need to follow host countries’ environmental standards and Belt and Road members can free ride on Chinese “green” initiatives, investment along the Belt and Road—particularly in new fossil fuel energy infrastructure—will undermine China’s political rhetoric and climate targets. While just recognizing the problem is a positive step for China, these initiatives are generally too voluntary to be effective, too duplicative to be adding value, and too opaque to be adequately assessed. HOW SERIOUS ARE CHINA’S EFFORTS TO “GREEN” THE BELT AND ROAD? For the last decade and a half, China has taken a prominent role in investing in and developing infrastructure projects around the world, particularly in the energy sector. These investments, which since 2013 have been loosely connected under the banner of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), have garnered a great deal of attention and criticism for their geopolitical, financial, and environmental implications. In response, China has launched a wide array of multilateral initiatives of varying scope and ambition to “green” the BRI. While just recognizing the problem is a positive step for China, these initiatives are generally too voluntary to be effective, too duplicative to be adding value, and too opaque to be adequately assessed. Though exact figures are hard to come by, China’s overseas investments reached a peak of $183 billion in 2016, and its $38-45 billion in overseas development finance is estimated to represent approximately a third of global official development assistance (ODA) each year. China’s two largest policy banks—the China Development Bank (CDB) and the China Export-Import Bank (EXIM)—now provide as much energy finance to foreign governments as all multilateral development banks (MDBs) combined. With more than a fifth of this money going toward coal since 2001 and fully three-quarters to some sort of fossil-fuel investment, the climate change implications of the BRI are highly problematic. The development of these energy sector projects is framed by two fundamental strategic issues: (1) the need to provide adequate supplies of affordable energy to sustain growth, and (2) the imperative to reduce emissions to tackle global climate change. Luckily, marrying these two objectives to achieve sustainable energy-fueled growth is more possible now than at any time in the past. The task is to figure out which strategies for engaging the BRI will be most effective in delivering these outcomes. This brief explores the BRI and some of China’s recent attempts to turn the BRI “green,” particularly through the BRI International Green Development Coalition and the Green Investment Principles for the Belt and Road Development. China would like the world to see its so-called “Belt and Road 2.0” underpin a grand new era of Chinese leadership, replete with sustainable development, economic growth, and continental interconnectivity. However, it remains unclear whether these new initiatives will deliver on the values they were created to uphold. Ultimately, this will depend on China’s ability (and willingness) to truly transition the BRI from opaque bilateral deals to inclusive, results-driven multilateralism and whether it can add teeth to its voluntary guidelines and standards. While just recognizing the problem is a positive step for China, these initiatives are generally too voluntary to be effective, too duplicative to be adding value, and too opaque to be adequately assessed. BELT AND ROAD: ALL-ENCOMPASSING SLOGAN OR GRAND STRATEGY? Since it was first announced in 2013, the BRI has grown to cover nearly every aspect of China’s foreign and economic policy. As much an “all-encompassing slogan” as a centralized grand strategy, the BRI reflects both the best and worst of China’s foreign policy. On the one hand, there is little doubt that Central and Southeast Asia—not to mention the African, Latin American, and Eastern European countries that now also form part of the Belt and Road—are suffering from a growing infrastructure gap and that China has the surplus capital to help fill it. On the other, provincial governments and private companies have been able to use the BRI slogan to engage in infrastructure projects of varying quality and environmental sustainability, and without consideration for host countries’ debt repayment capabilities, which has led to growing criticism of the BRI and hurt China’s reputation. Part of the perceived problem with the BRI was that the scale of its ambition was not matched by the requisite governance infrastructure or institutions to support it. As such, the BRI has also become the focal point of China’s recent attempts to reshape the international order (and its reputation with it) by building new multilateral institutions, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the New Development Bank (NDB). While BRI projects continue largely to be bilateral exercises between governments—including, quite often, provincial-to-provincial agreements—Xi Jinping’s attempts to turn the Belt and Road Forum into an international summit reflect China’s increasingly sophisticated international statecraft and growing ambitions. CHINESE FOREIGN INVESTMENT In the years since the global financial crisis disrupted China’s export-oriented growth model, China has grown to become the world’s largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) and ODA. According to AEI’s China Global Investment Tracker, Chinese investment and construction since 2005 has exceeded $2 trillion, over a third of which has been in the energy sector.1 Figure 1.1 shows how Chinese investment steadily increased over the last 10-15 years, before starting to decline in 2018. This decline has been driven by a large fall in transactions by state-owned enterprises, who have had less support from Beijing for global activities, as well as by recent trade disputes with the United States. Developed countries, such as the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom, have been the most popular destinations for investment, as have energy-intensive countries like Russia, Brazil, and Canada and countries with fast-growing energy demand like Indonesia and Pakistan (Figure 1.2) Chinese authorities have promised to deliver trillions of dollars in investment throughout the Central and Southeast Asian regions to fill large and growing infrastructure gaps. Unsurprisingly, many countries initially welcomed Chinese investment with open arms, particularly those in desperate need of additional energy capacity to meet the demands of growing economies. Pakistan famously signed on in 2015 to establish a China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) between Gwadar, a port in southern Pakistan, and the Xinjiang region in western China. Pakistan’s prime minister at the time, Nawaz Sharif, proclaimed that “friendship with China is the cornerstone of Pakistan’s foreign policy.” With the collection of projects now estimated to be worth some $62 billion, the economic corridor was meant to be a huge injection into Pakistan’s economy and an investment in its energy future for decades to come. In the years since the global financial crisis disrupted China’s export-oriented growth model, China has grown to become the world’s largest source of foreign direct investment Instead, CPEC has become emblematic of growing wariness of BRI projects, with environmentalists voicing increasing concerns over the type of energy projects being built and economists lamenting the conditions of Chinese lending. Even with only about a third of CPEC projects materializing so far, Pakistan has needed to go to the IMF to seek a financial bailout as its debts mount, foreign reserves dwindle, and international lenders balk at its economic outlook. Sri Lanka had a similar experience with the development of its port, Hambantota, which is now subject to a 99-year lease to China while Sri Lanka is mired debt from the project. The experience of countries like Pakistan and Sri Lanka have led several commentators to refer to the BRI as China’s “debt-trap diplomacy,” an image China is now desperately trying to avoid. Furthermore, China has come under fire for the environmental track record of BRI projects. Following these criticisms, at the first Belt and Road Forum in May 2017, President Xi Jinping noted in his keynote address the need to pursue a “new vision of green development and a way of life and work that is green, low-carbon, circular and sustainable.” To a concerning degree, one simply must hope China will back up its rhetoric with action. BRI countries comprised approximately 19 percent of all CO2 emissions in 2014, still below low China’s 28 percent contribution (see Figure 2). At a combined 48 percent, China and BRI countries emit roughly as much CO2 as the rest of the world combined. China’s choices, therefore, with respect to what fuel sources it chooses to invest in and the environmental standards it imposes on its foreign investment, will be an important factor in how successfully the world deals with the climate crisis. Unfortunately, of the $540 billion in energy investment made by Chinese development banks since 2005, 74 percent has gone towards hydrocarbon-related projects (see Figure 3).2 A World Resources Institute report similarly found that the vast majority of energy-sector investments made under the BRI were in fossil-fuel assets that will lock countries into carbon-emitting fuel sources for decades. They estimated that between 2001 and 2016, more than 50 coal-fired power plants were financed by Chinese institutions, the majority of which used the most carbon-intensive coal technologies. Another report estimates that Chinese financial institutions have committed or offered funding to over a third of all coal development taking place outside of China and India. Once again Pakistan is illustrative, with China having invested in 13 separate coal projects worth over $11 billion—25 percent of all Chinese investment in the country. However, with several of these projects already experiencing financial difficulties, it is uncertain how many will reach completion. The vast majority of energy-sector investments made under the BRI were in fossil-fuel assets that will lock countries into carbon-emitting fuel sources for decades. These trends are important in a region projected to grow significantly in its GDP, population, and greenhouse-gas emissions. Ten BRI countries are experiencing double-digit annual growth in CO2 emissions (Figure 4). In emerging Asia, for example, power capacity is expected to almost double between 2017 and 2030 with its share of global coal demand increasing from 20 to 29 percent. Furthermore, many BRI countries are projected to be some of the worst-affected by climate change and extreme weather events. Pakistan, for example, is estimated to be the eighth most at risk of climate change impacts and to have already suffered from 145 extreme weather events related to climate change, resulting in the loss of over 10,000 lives. The vast majority of energy-sector investments made under the BRI were in fossil-fuel assets that will lock countries into carbon-emitting fuel sources for decades. Of course, China is the world’s largest emitter, and the extent to which it focuses on environmental sustainability at home will determine its ability to create a green BRI.

48,2013,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/currency-manipulation-and-belt-road,en,"Currency Manipulation and the Belt & Road Available Downloads Scott Miller: I'm Scott. Bill Reinsch: I'm Bill. Scott and Bill: And we're the Trade Guys. Andrew Schwartz: You're listening to The Trade Guys, a podcast produced by CSIS where we talk about trade in terms that everyone can understand. I'm H. Andrew Schwartz, and I'm here with Scott Miller and Bill Reinsch, the CSIS Trade Guys. In this episode, we're going to talk the topsy-turvy situation with China, what's going on this week with the markets, with the currency manipulation accusation. What is going on with the U.S. and China? Plus, we welcome a special in-house guest. Jon Hillman is a senior fellow with the CSIS Simon Chair. Jon also directs the Reconnecting Asia Project at CSIS, which tracks new roads, railways, ports, and other infrastructure across Eurasia and China's Belt and Road Initiative. We'll discuss what the Belt and Road Initiative is, how it might be affecting global trade, and what the initiative says about China's economic vision. You'll hear all that and more on this episode of The Trade Guys. Andrew Schwartz: And we're off. This week, gentlemen, was a little insane with what's going on with China. We had a big back and forth with the Chinese, they're currency manipulators according to the Trump administration and the market had a precipitous fall. Today though, it's back up as we speak at 3:30 on, what are we, Tuesday, 3:30 on Tuesday, it's back up 277 points and climbing. What's going on, Trade Guys? Tell us your wisdom. Scott Miller: Just as a starting point, it looks to me like the president is frustrated. Andrew Schwartz: Yeah, he's frustrated. Scott Miller: Negotiations aren't going as he anticipated and so, he's taking action. Actually, what it looks like is a sort of classic pressure or leverage move on his part. I think there's some disappointment involved. The currency manipulation charge is a little odd, mostly because it seems to have been a relatively short-term effect. Andrew Schwartz: Well they think we're currency manipulators too, don't they? Bill Reinsch: We're about to be, I think. Scott Miller: We may be. It's a little harder for us to actually move it, but the Treasury Department does have criteria, they do evaluate all currencies every six months by statute, and China didn't meet the criteria for currency manipulated at the last regular evaluation, but it does now and being labeled a currency manipulator doesn't have any immediate action, I mean other than being called sort of you're a bad economy- Andrew Schwartz: Yeah. Scott Miller: … or something like that. It's a messaging thing. At the same time, because the financial system is quite complicated, there's only so much that the Chinese can do in terms of lowering the value of the RMB without creating a lot of internal risks. For instance, if you're a Chinese company, you're buying and selling in RMB. If you have financing from a foreign bank, it's probably in a foreign currency. So, yesterday, if you're a Chinese entity selling and buying in RMB, which dropped precipitously, and you're repaying your loans in yen which went up precipitously, that's the recipe for default and is essentially the very thing, when it persisted, which caused the Asian financial crisis, or the start of the Asian financial crisis, in 1997. So this really can't go on too long and it looks like today that China began to defend the RMB, it didn't fall further and that, I think, calmed markets. Andrew Schwartz: Okay, so did they think they had us in a tough place? I don't really understand this, I have to tell you. It felt like we were at a disadvantage all of the sudden because we got tough with them, but is that not the case? Bill Reinsch: The charitable explanation and kind of my take on it is that this happens a lot when leaders or principals get together. They don't like to be confrontational with each other. They're confrontational when they're away from each other. Scott Miller: Yes. Bill Reinsch: But when they're in the same room together, they don't do that, and they talk past each other. And so they came out of Osaka announcing that they'd agreed without really understanding what the other guy was saying and it seemed to me that Trump clearly thought that the Chinese promised to buy more agricultural products and... Andrew Schwartz: That's what he wanted to hear. Bill Reinsch: That's what he wanted to hear, and he thinks that's what they said, and they haven't, at least as many or as much as he wants. It looks like Xi thought that Trump agreed there wouldn't be any new tariffs right away. Andrew Schwartz: Yep. Bill Reinsch: Because they were going to come back to the table, so Lighthizer and Mnuchin come back from Shanghai, report not a lot of progress. Trump loses it, announces the tariffs and announces that the Chinese are not buying enough agricultural products. So, from Trump's perspective, it's a breach of faith on the Chinese part. From Xi's standpoint, it's a breach of faith on the American part. And then, it's Trump doing what he... announcing the tariffs, which is a classic leverage move as you've said. Then I think what the Chinese have done is to say in effect, not too subtly, ""Hey, we got tools too."" Andrew Schwartz: Right. Scott Miller: Yeah. Bill Reinsch: I mean, I don’t think they… Nobody thinks they forced the RMB down. All they did was stop defending it, and it went down on its own accord- Scott Miller: Yes. That’s right. Bill Reinsch: … because those market forces are going to take it down because their economy's slowing down. Scott Miller: Sure. Bill Reinsch: So what they've done for the last year is prop it up, which is ironic because when you tell them not to manipulate their currency, you’re… in fact, to the extent they've been manipulating their currency it’s been to help us, not hurt us. And they stopped doing that, so it went down. There's a tool. They announced yesterday they're not going to buy anymore agricultural products. Another tool. Scott Miller: Yes. Bill Reinsch: I mean they're dropping hints all over the place. The Trump view was because we have a big deficit with them, we have more leverage. We buy all this stuff and they don't buy as much stuff, we could hurt them more than they could hurt us. I win. And what the Chinese are saying, ""No, it's more complicated than that. We've got a lot of other tools."" Scott Miller: Yes, and while we may or may not have more leverage because of the size of the deficit, China definitely has more ability to withstand or tolerate irritation and pain. Just their politics are different. Andrew Schwartz: And their investors are not necessarily going to be able to call up their leader and say, ""Hey, I lost x millions of dollars if not billions today and I don't like it."" Scott Miller: Yes. Now, yesterday was the worst day in equity markets for 2019. Andrew Schwartz: That's right. Scott Miller: And now every year has a worst day, it just happens, so- Bill Reinsch: But it's noteworthy just on that, that the market is lower now than it was in January 2018. Scott Miller: That, for me, is the key is this all started about January 2018 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, at least, as a benchmark, is lower today than it was in January 2018. Andrew Schwartz: So all these gains we made are erased. Scott Miller: Well, the thing is that says the equity prices are equal despite a strong economy, despite strong corporate earnings, which says there's some uncertainty there. There's some questions about investment, so overall when you look over the period of 20 months- Andrew Schwartz: It's not that the gains we made there are erased, it's that there's uncertainty. Scott Miller: Yes. The markets have been basically flat for 18 months during the time of this controversy with China. Andrew Schwartz: So, if you're Trump and your claim to fame is you make good deals, you exert leverage, and you get results, maybe that's not the case here. Scott Miller: He's at a point of stalemate at the moment. Bill Reinsch: It's exactly what we said. It's an unusual... For me, it was an unexpected development. I had the great good luck to be in Canada while all this happened, so I didn't have to think about it too much, but I mean we've talked about this before. Eventually, he's going to figure out that he's not going to get what he wants, and then he has to decide whether to settle for less and call it victory or continue the war and keep on fighting. Scott Miller: Yes. Bill Reinsch: This, to me, is kind of an unexpected blip. He reacted, probably overreacted. I think they decided that they've had enough and needed to send some signals about what… their limitations to what they're going to put up with. What I hope does not happen is that, you know, the logical doubling down response for Trump is we're going to devalue the dollar, which is a lot easier said than done., and more pressure on the Fed to do that because the U.S. government... Not the Fed, the government doesn't have enough money to do that on its own, so the Fed would have to cooperate. The only way you can do that if you're the United States is if you line up all your allies- Scott Miller: Right. Bill Reinsch: … to help you, which is what we did in the Plaza Accord in '85 or '86. But I can see Trump trying to muscle the Fed into doing this. At some point- Andrew Schwartz: Sounds like a lot of work. Bill Reinsch: Well, at some point we have to have an adult who says, ""This is stupid."" You know, if you get into a cycle of competitive devaluations, the last time we did that was during the Depression and it did not have a happy ending. Scott Miller: Yeah, my sense is that it's going to be an interesting month because the tariff increases will take effect September 1, so there's some time for things to calm down here a little bit, and it could be that the president decides that we're going to live with this for a while and he's not going to try to escalate. Also, you know, I would just point out that when China says we're not buying American farm goods anymore, it's not like the Chinese or their livestock are going to stop eating, okay? They're going to buy some imported products likely from other economies, and there'll be some global demand for global exports, but it is a pretty direct message. I would agree with that. Andrew Schwartz: Politically, what's his game here? What's his endgame? Is it that he's going to play this out for a while, and then figure out a way to come in and save the day and take credit that he ultimately won? Is that the endgame? Bill Reinsch: You mean Trump? Andrew Schwartz: Yeah. Trump. Bill Reinsch: I think he has to play it out for a while, because in the end, it's going to be less than he wants, and he has to sell it as a victory. And the best time to do that is shortly before the election, so people won't know it's bad until after they voted. So, he has to string this out for a year. And, yeah, this is a way to do that. Just keep people guessing. Scott Miller: Which is roughly what we talked about a week ago- Andrew Schwartz: It is. Scott Miller: … in the tweetstorm. Andrew Schwartz: Okay, but what I don't understand is, while he strings this out, maybe some Republicans have tolerance for that string of a game, but do investors and serious businesspeople have that kind of tolerance for that kind of game? Scott Miller: Look, the president's China policy is astonishingly popular in Washington. Andrew Schwartz: Yeah. Scott Miller: It is one of two things, in my view, there is actual bipartisan support for. The other thing is dealing with big tech. Where both Republicans, Democrats agree something has to be done. They don't agree on the something, but when it comes to U.S.-China economic policy, the president has a lot of support right at the moment, and I wouldn't expect that to change overnight. Andrew Schwartz: Okay, but what about the rich people that President Trump absolutely cares about. Rich guys in New York ",2013-2017,4,high_conflict

Available Downloads Daniel Runde testified before the House CCP Select Committee on how the United States can create a strategy to counter to China’s development offensive by crafting an alternative positive narrative, rather than a demand that developing nations cease working with China. Chairman Moolenaar, Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi and distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for asking me to testify before you today. It is a privilege and an honor. The views represented in this testimony are my own and should not be taken as representing those of my current or former employers. Currently, I hold an endowed chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), researching how we might use American soft power and influence around the world. I served in the Bush Administration at USAID, worked for a time at the World Bank Group, and started my career in investment and commercial banking. I recently published a book, “The American Imperative: Reclaiming Global Leadership Through Soft Power” that discusses among other things how we should push back against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in this Age of Great Power Competition. I am submitting a series of CSIS reports and other articles for the record. Let me make several key points with my time today. My main message is this: in this era of Great Power Competition, the United States must formulate a strategy that advances areas where it has a comparative advantage over China while focusing on regions vital to U.S. economic and national security interests. The United States needs an alternative positive narrative, rather than a demand that developing nations cease working with China, who is likely their top trading partner and debt holder.[1] We have taken some steps in response, but our response is far from adequate. Specifically, - China is seen as a “near peer hard power” competitor, but it is clear they are also a “near-peer soft power competitor.” China can, and will, fill any void we leave in ways that they could not even 15 years ago, including vaccines, telecommunications, undersea cables, ports, roads, leadership in the multilateral system or many other non-military areas. They can match us in these areas of soft power and, at times, offer something better. - If we do not meet the hopes and aspirations of developing countries, then developing countries turn to China. We must provide (or enable) an alternative. - We do not have to meet China dollar for dollar, but we must work with partners and allies while leveraging the private sector so we can be better infrastructure investment partners than China. The United States does not have companies and capabilities at the price point that China offers. From project identification to signing, commencing and completing—China is much faster and cheaper than the United States at virtually every stage. The Western offer, therefore, must work on being faster and being stronger in other ways to compete effectively. - The United States must focus on key sectors and locations. Looking at countries and potential projects through a military, economic, and strategic lens is a crucial first step. What would failing to challenge a particular Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) project signal to neighbors in the region? If China wants to build a farm-to-market road in the middle of nowhere, that might be fine. If China wants to build a dual-use port on the other side of the Atlantic in Africa, that’s definitely not fine. If China makes a play to control the digital rails of the future via Huawei, ZTE and Alipay, we need a plan to counter that, too. - The United States must improve its commercial diplomacy to unlock the private sector of the United States and our allies. Chinese infrastructure investment in developing countries often unlocks access to the world’s largest trading nation—China, and China is indeed the top trading partner for more than 120 countries which is a driving force behind the BRI.[2] Countries are incentivized to pursue projects with the country that they are doing the most business with. In all sectors, the private sector can act as a lending arm to achieve a scale impossible for any singular development agency or bank. - At the end of the day, infrastructure, both digital and transportation, bends towards trading routes. If your number one trading partner is China, then China-oriented infrastructure will follow. We will need to lead in global trade if we want to ultimately push back against Belt and Road. We can do this with more targeted and effective trade deals while also showcasing U.S. leadership in things like AI, space, democracy, etc. which should also be attractive to peoples and leaders around the world in contrast with China’s system. Ideally, we would lead the world in trade as we did 25 years ago. What is the BRI and Why Does It Matter? China announced the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013 as a combination of construction and financing projects for roads, airports, ports, and energy across greater Asia.[3] 2015 was a watershed year which saw the official launch of the BRI[4] and the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), headquartered in Beijing and positioned as a Chinese-led alternative to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.[5] In the decade since the BRI’s launch, the BRI has facilitated Chinese investment worth upwards of $1 trillion[6] in over 140 countries across Africa, Oceania, and Latin America. China has surpassed the World Bank and other Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) as the world’s biggest official creditor.[7] The BRI is an ambitious and hopeful project that speaks to the aspirations of China’s friends and potential friends. As many countries have become wealthier, their interests have progressed beyond basic human needs (what the United States prefers to fund with our foreign aid dollars) to issues like energy, telecommunications, trade, and investment. China has tapped into these interests by offering large amounts of government financing with few questions asked, working bilaterally, and promising to deliver projects quickly. It has been successful largely because it is willing to assume risks that other investors have not, whether legal or illegal. In too many cases, China’s offer is the only option. China’s BRI—and the low-quality, fast-built infrastructure that often characterizes it—threatens to constrain development and America’s ability to project power as China increases infrastructure ownership or control, enabling economic and military expansion. The continuation of the BRI without any formidable alternative from the United States risks creating unwarranted dependence on China in much of the world. Infrastructure Needs in the Global South Over the next 15 years, more infrastructure is projected to be built globally than currently exists.[8] By 2050, there would be 15.5 million miles of new paved roads, enough to circle the world more than 600 times.[9] This global build-out will have profound implications for the economic, security, and environmental wellbeing of countries throughout the world.[10] The United States needs a strategy for contributing effectively to this effort while advancing its own interests in a world that is literally being remade. World nuclear generating capacity is projected to double by 2050.[11] There is not a single operational nuclear power plant in the ASEAN region.[12] China currently has 36 reactors under development and is expected to leapfrog the United States and France to become the world’s leading source of nuclear power by the end of the decade.[13] There is an unmet demand for digital infrastructure as more of the world comes online. Digital infrastructure is increasingly underpinning traditional infrastructure. Bandwidth needs are expected to triple between 2022 and 2027.[14] China has become a leading subsea cable provider and owner as part of its “Digital Silk Road” – the digital arm of its BRI expansion strategy.[15] Chinese state-owned and subsidized firm HMN Technologies (Huawei) is now the fourth largest cable provider globally and has seen the fastest growth over the past decade, completing over 108 projects.[16] Beijing reportedly aims to capture 60 percent of the fiber-optic cable market by 2025.[17] Chinese control over data transmission lines raises the risk of espionage or sabotage. China has also developed a global network of strategically vital ports under its “Maritime Silk Road” – the oceanic counterpart of the Digital Silk Road. Beijing now owns or operates ports and terminals at nearly 100 locations in over 50 countries, spanning every ocean and every continent, effectively leaving the Chinese Communist Party in control of the ports that lie at the heart of global supply chains.[18] Many of these ports have the potential for dual and triple use as military bases and intelligence gathering sites.[19] Despite widespread agreement about the importance of increasing infrastructure investment, two gaps stand in the way. The first gap is quantitative: the Global Infrastructure Outlook estimates that there will be a $15 trillion investment gap by 2040 given current trends. Over 150 countries have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with China, including EU members and Latin American and Caribbean nations.[20] The second gap is qualitative. Not every road, power plant, or fiber-optic cable is created equal. There is a wide spectrum of practices and standards for project selection, construction, and operation. Some projects are built with long-term maintenance and operations costs in mind, while others hide and defer these costs. Stemming from different financing approaches and procurement practices, projects can differ in their openness to competition, opportunities for participation among local firms, and demands to transfer technology and expertise. Done poorly, infrastructure projects can destroy more value than they create.[21] What Has Been the Response to the BRI from the United States and Allies? The United States is now sharpening its infrastructure toolkit after decades of neglect. The United States largely got out of the direct infrastructure business in the developing world in the 1970s. The “New Directions” legislation, passed by Congress in 1973, accelerated the transition from providing loans to providing grants, and from focusing on delivering large capital projects to providing technical assistance and a focus on basic human needs.[22] After declining for decades, infrastructure as a percentage of total investment at the Multilateral Development Banks like the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank, the primary avenue for U.S. indirect support for foreign infrastructure projects, began rising in the early 2000s.[23] The United States has also taken steps towards assembling its own arsenal to better compete against China. In 2019, President Trump put forward reforms to the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM Bank) and the EXIM Bank was reauthorized by Congress to better compete within the rapidly developing arena of export finance.[24] Congress also passed the BUILD Act, which consolidated several development finance activities into a new agency, the Development Finance Corporation (DFC). I want to make a key point; I have heard many smart people say that the DFC is our response to Belt and Road. The DFC did $9 billion across about 130 transactions last year,[25] while China’s BRI did $92 billion across about 210 deals.[26] The DFC is not the silver bullet to counteract the BRI that it has mistakenly purported to be, but the DFC has been an important asset in U.S. development strategy.[27] In 2018, the Trump administration agreed to a capital increase for the World Bank, the United States invested $1.2 billion[28] with the support of Congress. This increase was part of an ambitious package that included a serie",2013-2017,14,high_conflict
50,2013,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/greening-or-greenwashing-belt-and-road-initiative,en,"Greening or Greenwashing the Belt and Road Initiative? Energy Fact & Opinion Facts: - The second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation met in Beijing, on April 25-27, 2019. - During the three-day forum that drew leaders from 37 countries, China highlighted a few deliverables related to energy, environment, and climate. - Both the keynote by Chinese president Xi Jinping on Day 2 of the forum and the BRI progress report, released few days before the forum, stressed China’s commitment to environmental sustainability but fell short of introducing concrete steps to correct its high carbon financing practices. Opinion: Energy projects have been central to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) since its inception in 2013. For example, energy accounts for roughly 44 percent of BRI construction, followed by transport at 30 percent. Chinese financing and exports have targeted the unmet energy generation and transportation infrastructure needs in countries around the world. While Chinese financing and exports are not limited to fossil energy projects, China’s energy outreach under the BRI has been carbon-intensive. For example, the Silk Road Fund, which was set up to finance BRI projects, made over 90 percent of its energy-sector investments in fossil fuel projects. Moreover, between 2013 and 2016, Chinese financial institutions invested $15 billion in coal projects abroad. Especially since the first forum two years ago, “greening” has become a sub-theme of the BRI that seeks to propel China to become a global leader in environmentally sustainable development. For example, the government guidance on how to execute the BRI visions, which was released shortly before the first forum in May 2017, suggests that China sees it its moral obligation to share its “experience and practice in ecological civilization and green development” with other growing economies, as well as to promote global trade, investment and financial systems that are environmentally sustainable. In its seventh year, however, the BRI finds itself under a heightened pressure to address the emissions implications of its energy projects. In 2018, over 40 percent of the BRI lending for the power sector was still in coal projects. Also, some BRI recipient countries are beginning to voice concern over Chinese coal projects for their impact on the local environment as well as the potential of crowding out lower carbon power generation alternatives in the future. In Kenya, the construction of a Chinese financed coal power project has been halted per judicial order issued in September 2018 amid local environmental activists warning the environmental and public health effects of burning coal. In December 2018, Pakistan decided to suspend a 1,300-megawatt coal project that had been planned under the auspices of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a flagship BRI project, as the Pakistani government had determined that “surplus generation capacity had already been contracted and more contracts would lead the country to a capacity trap.” Cognizant of the reputational toll from high emission energy financing, the Chinese government highlighted a few initiatives that seem to emphasize its commitment to greening BRI during the second forum. For example, the Green Investment Principles (GIP), which aim to build an international network to improve the management of environmental and social risks for investing in the BRI regions, has gained 27 signatories, including the financial institutions from France, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates. The GIP was co-developed and announced by China’s Green Finance Committee and the City of London’s Green Finance Initiative in 2017. Also, following through on Chinese president Xi Jinping’s call for its creation two years ago, the Chinese government launched the Belt and Road International Green Development Coalition in an effort to align the BRI’s environmental sustainability principles with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The coalition was co-initiated by the UN Environment Programme and the Chinese Ministry of Ecology and Environment. To the UN, this coalition can be another tool to help its effort to steer Chinese energy investments toward a lower emissions profile while also assisting BRI partner countries gain or exercise due diligence capacity when it comes to evaluating social and environmental impacts of choosing energy infrastructure projects. The biennial forums may be a useful customer relations occasion for Beijing. It may also be reassuring for the world to see a list of initiatives that underscore China’s continued commitment to environmentally sustainable development. The time appears ripe, however, for Beijing to begin checking off the to-do list of existing commitments. For example, issued ahead of the launch of the BRI itself in 2013, the Chinese government guidance calls for Chinese companies to borrow best practices from multilateral development banks and international organizations in terms of environmental protection in foreign investment. Yet, Chinese banks and companies significantly lag behind their cohorts in terms of transparency and accountability. For example, the member countries to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have reporting obligations on the loans, guarantees, and insurance provided by their export credit agencies or their aid agencies, but China has no comparable reporting obligation, as the second largest economy in the world is not an OECD member. Also, the export credit agencies of OECD member countries are bound by agreement to phase out the financing for the least efficient, high emission coal-fired power generation technologies, but China remains unconstrained. The BRI has a great potential to become a force for the global clean energy transition underway. Beijing has now had several chances to take its green intentions and turn them into action. Making good on the environmental protocols and standards it has once again put forward to guide BRI investments will mean the difference between genuine greening or simply greenwashing.",2013-2017,2,mid_conflict
51,2013,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/how-big-chinas-belt-and-road,en,"How Big Is China’s Belt and Road? The big numbers being floated for President Xi Jinping’s signature foreign policy effort, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), do not add up. Popular estimates for Chinese investment under the BRI range from $1 trillion to $8 trillion, hardly a rounding error. Without a clearer sense of the BRI’s scale, it is difficult to assess its economic and strategic implications. A closer look reveals the highest figures are inflated, scoring political points for Beijing in the short term but also creating unrealistic expectations. Mapping the BRI is part art, part science. It is a moving target, loosely defined and ever expanding. It includes Chinese investment in roads, ports, and other hard infrastructure. It includes trade deals, transportation agreements, and other “soft” infrastructure efforts. If you traveled to China since September 2013, congratulations, you may have participated in the BRI. It includes tourism and other “people-to-people” ties such as education and cultural exchanges. The BRI is not constrained by geography or even gravity. When announced in 2013, it had two major components: an overland “belt” across the Eurasian supercontinent and a maritime “road” across the Indian ocean and up to Europe via the Suez Canal. Since its announcement in 2013, this vision has stretched into the Arctic, cyberspace, and outer space. Countries have signed onto the BRI in places as far-flung from China as Central America. But participation in the BRI is less meaningful than it might seem. Roughly 70 countries have joined, but their levels of Chinese investment vary widely. Pakistan has attracted some $60 billion for projects. South Korea signed up, but as of last year, it had no BRI projects. Despite being among the most vocal critics of the BRI, India has still attracted some Chinese investment. An industrial park in Gurajat, for example, would be easily branded as a BRI project elsewhere. In sum, participation in the BRI is not a prerequisite for doing related business with China, nor is participation a guarantee of more business. There is no firm timeline for the BRI. Some projects and activities that started before the BRI was announced have been rebranded and are often counted along with more recent projects. Until recently, some experts expected the BRI would be phased out when Xi left office in 2022. But having done away with presidential term limits, Xi could stick around for longer, as could his signature foreign policy vision. Theoretically, the BRI could stretch to 2049, the 100th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China and Xi’s target date for establishing China as “fully developed, rich, and powerful.” Different assumptions for these basic questions—what, where, who, and when—naturally lead to different estimates for the BRI’s size. Stretch any dimension, and the numbers start to rise, especially if looking into the future. But look at what has happened to date, and a more modest picture begins to emerge, including risks that could eventually deflate the BRI’s grand ambitions. Consider the most common estimate: $1 trillion. This figure is usually tied to promised infrastructure investment. Note the two key qualifiers: infrastructure and promised. Infrastructure, which the CSIS Reconnecting Asia Project tracks, is a major component of the BRI, but as noted earlier, not the entirety of it. There is a natural lag between infrastructure pledges and actual investment, given the complexity of the project planning and construction process. But China, like other countries, also tends to promise more than it delivers. The best available data suggest that China’s $1 trillion promise has not been met, and at current trends, will not be met for several years. The Reconnecting Asia Project is tracking roughly $90 billion of Chinese funding for transportation projects (specifically, railways, roads, ports, and dry ports) during 2014–2017. Later this year, we’ll add power plants, which along with other energy projects, play a significant part in BRI activities. For example, roughly half of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor’s investments are energy related. The American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and Heritage Chinese Global Investment Tracker, which tracks Chinese construction and investment across all sectors, puts the total at roughly $340 billion during 2014–2017. According to AEI’s Cecilia Joy-Perez and Derek Scissors, current trends suggest it would take six to seven years for the BRI to reach the $1 trillion mark. Given limited private-sector participation, they reason that state-driven activities could push the BRI across the $2 trillion threshold in the 2030s. So how did BRI estimates balloon to $8 trillion? Here’s a theory: they conflate Asia’s massive infrastructure needs with comparatively modest Chinese investments. Many references to the $8 trillion figure lead back to a 2016 commentary in the Hong Kong Economic Journal, which noted, “The financial experts at the State Council have estimated that ‘One Belt, One Road’ would cost as much as US$8 trillion if it was fully implemented following Xi’s orders.” That State Council estimate has remained elusive. But a similar number was in circulation around the same time. In 2009, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimated that developing Asia needed $8 trillion of infrastructure investment during 2010–2020. If there was a State Council estimate, its author may have adopted the ADB’s figure for several reasons. The BRI has only been defined in broad strokes, making reliable estimates difficult if not impossible. And why create a new estimate from scratch, when you could borrow an existing one? Additionally, the BRI has evolved since its announcement. A vision document for maritime cooperation under the BRI was not issued until June 2017. Even the name has changed, having started as the “One Belt, One Road” (OBOR). Misperceptions about the BRI’s size carry practical implications. For now, Chinese officials can enjoy watching the estimates rise and could even reap some political benefits. They have conjured up a massive carrot that has caught the world’s attention. Some developing countries are “linking” their development plans with the BRI. International companies have assembled teams to source BRI deals. All of these activities reflect a willingness to organize, at least in appearance, around China’s vision. But China also faces downsides to unrealistic BRI estimates. The BRI’s size excites some observers but worries others. As the effort inflates, so do concerns about its impact on debt levels, the environment, and even regional security. For China, perhaps the biggest risk is unmet expectations. With the world watching, China now faces pressure to deliver on its promises. Even if Chinese officials did not promise trillions of dollars in investment, they have done little to correct these misperceptions. A little modesty about the BRI’s scale could go a long way. For supporters, it could help reset expectations. For skeptics, it could temper fears about the BRI’s risks. The benefits are obvious, but they require bringing Xi’s grand vision down to earth. That is a price few of his advisers will be eager to pay. Jonathan Hillman is director of the Reconnecting Asia Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.

52,2013,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/president-xi-jinpings-belt-and-road-forum,en,"President Xi Jinping’s “Belt and Road” Forum Background China’s biggest diplomatic event of the year is on May 14–15, when President Xi Jinping will welcome leaders from 28 countries and delegates from 110 countries at the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing. (To learn more about the infrastructure push across the Eurasian supercontinent, see CSIS’s Reconnecting Asia Project.) Q1: What is the “Belt and Road” initiative? A1: Announced in 2013, the Belt and Road initiative (formerly known as “One Belt, One Road,” or OBOR) aims to put China at the center of global economic affairs. It consists of two main components: an overland Silk Road Economic Belt connecting China with Central Asia and beyond, and an ocean-based 21st Century Maritime Silk Road to China’s south. Functionally, the initiative aims to improve hard infrastructure, soft infrastructure, and even cultural ties. Geographically, it includes roughly 65 countries comprising about 70 percent of the world’s population. Economically, it could involve Chinese investments approaching $4 trillion. The scope and scale of the initiative are somewhat elastic, but all signs point to an ambitious and consequential endeavor: a future where all roads lead to Beijing. Q2: What does Xi hope to accomplish at the forum? A2: The Belt and Road initiative is Xi’s signature foreign policy effort. Following on from his meeting last month in Florida with President Donald Trump, the forum represents the next way station in a series of carefully choreographed events designed to burnish Xi’s international leadership credentials and showcase his domestic strength on the road to the 19th Party Congress in the fall, where he hopes to recast the new Politburo lineup in his own image and further establish his position of primacy within the leadership. The forum also will provide Xi with a stage for tweaking the overall vision—as well as laying out some new specific projects—of the initiative after what is widely acknowledged to have been a slow and uneven start. He likely hopes, for example, to demonstrate how the initiative can serve as an integrative platform for coordinating China’s “alphabet soup” of initiatives—such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) forum, and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC)—which were begun under his predecessors but have had little to show in terms of concrete accomplishments. Q3: How are other countries in the region and beyond responding? A3: The Belt and Road has elicited a range of interest, competition, and caution. Reactions are strongest within Asia, which has enormous infrastructure needs. According to the Asian Development Bank, developing Asia must spend $26 trillion by 2030 to maintain its growth, eradicate poverty, and respond to climate change. Many of Asia’s smaller economies have been eager to cooperate with the Belt and Road, particularly to attract infrastructure investment as they aim to develop further and grow into hubs along emerging trade routes. For similar reasons, there are also eager participants in Africa, South America, and some parts of the Middle East. But Asia’s smaller economies are not limiting their options, and many are also tapping into competing initiatives. Indeed, China is not the only country with big connectivity plans. Japan has launched the Partnership for Quality Infrastructure, a $200 billion, five-year effort that prioritizes east-west connections, particularly in Southeast Asia. India is primarily focused on improving its internal connectivity but has invested in a few strategic projects beyond its borders. Russia’s Eurasian Economic Union covers much of the territory through which overland routes between China and Europe must pass, and President Vladimir Putin will be attending the forum. South Korea, Turkey, and others are advancing their own visions for the region. Europe and the United States have been more cautious. Reactions within Europe vary widely, with Eastern European states generally more eager to participate in the Belt and Road than their Western neighbors. To date, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni of Italy is the only leader from a Group of Seven (G7) country expected to attend the forum. France and Germany are expected to send senior officials. The United States is not expected to send a high-profile representative. The primary reasons for caution are threefold. First, there are concerns about standards, particularly whether new projects will adhere to adequate environmental and social safeguards. The Chinese-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) claims it will apply existing best standards but more efficiently; AIIB president Jin Liqun has said the Bank will be “lean, clean, and green.” Second, there are economic concerns about unsustainable debt and financial risks, given China’s desire to export its overcapacity, the challenging nature of large infrastructure projects, and the difficult geographic and political environments the Belt and Road aims to traverse. Finally, there are strategic concerns about the Belt and Road’s drivers and implications. Railways, ports, and other infrastructure projects are dual use, leading to speculation that the real value in some economically questionable projects is their military utility. Over the longer term, even more consequential would be the economic power and influence that would accrue to China if the Belt and Road’s ambitions are fully realized. Q4: How does the Belt and Road impact U.S. interests? A4 : As an Asia-Pacific power, the United States has significant economic and strategic interests at stake in the region’s infrastructure push. U.S. infrastructure companies, including related service providers, have an opportunity to tap into this dynamic market and grow with it. Along with U.S. officials, they can bring experience setting standards and safeguards that will help Asia connect in a more inclusive and sustainable way. Strategically, the United States has an interest in ensuring that no single entity dominates the Eurasian landmass, where a majority of the world’s people and economic power resides and where unrestrained competition led to global conflict twice during the last century.

In that context, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) came into existence with a mandate to create strong and sustainable market institutions in the post-Communist Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries and to enable the growth of free enterprises and the private sector. Founded in April 1991, the EBRD had 40 members in its original constitution (Figure 1) and had the support of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Economic Community (presently known as the European Union).1 Figure 1: Shareholding Percentage (as of 2018) For many post-Communist countries, the lingering legacy of a state-controlled economy meant that the traditional forms of private-sector investments were absent. In the years following the collapse of Communism, the issue of state-owned enterprises dogged the efforts of many countries as they attempted to build capitalist economies. State-owned enterprises employed tens of millions of people and therefore could not be shut down unilaterally without destabilizing effects, making them resistant to market reforms.2 The radical economic liberalization policies involving ending price and currency controls, opening up countries to trade, and removing unproductive state subsidies also shocked these young democracies struggling to build public trust in their institutions.3 Given these complexities, the EBRD was tasked with promoting, supporting, and providing private investments, strengthening the domestic resource mobilization capacities of its member countries, providing public-sector entities with technical assistance on project finance management, and deepening local capital markets.4 Table 1: Founding Members of the EBRD Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of the EBRD vis-à-vis other multilateral development banks (MDBs) was its mandated commitment to the key principles of democracy.5 This commitment was codified in Article 1 of the Agreement Establishing the EBRD, which mandates that the financial institution carry out its functions only in those member countries that are “committed to and applying the principles of multiparty democracy, pluralism and market economics.”6 EBRD shareholders recognized that economic reform did not take place in a political vacuum and that a serious reorganization of the post-Communist state apparatus required a pluralistic society and multiparty democracy. Shareholders believed that these principles and sociopolitical characteristics would ensure that the broader economic reform efforts did not lead to the transformation of state-owned monopolies into politically powerful private cartels. The charter also calls for the EBRD to not provide any concessional lending and to make a minimum of 60 percent of its commitments in the private sector.7 The Evolution of the EBRD Over its nearly 30-year history, the EBRD has made a total of €130 billion (approximately $145 billion) in commitments (Figure 2). With globalization significantly impacting the political economy of Europe and its economic partners, the functions and operations of the EBRD started to evolve to better suit the interests of its member countries and shareholders. Moreover, a significant factor in the way the EBRD was understood and valued by the European community stemmed from a perception of the bank as a potentially useful instrument to support EU accession. This entailed a shift of geographic focus, sectors of investment, makeup of the clientele, and preferred financial instruments. The EBRD has spread its regional focus significantly from the original 23 recipient countries and progressively expanded its reach into Mongolia (2006); Turkey (2009); Jordan, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, and Kosovo (2012); Cyprus (2014); Greece (2015); and Lebanon (2017). Over the years, countries in Central Asia and the Middle East and North Africa, have found a prominent place in the EBRD’s investment strategy. To illustrate this shift, about 62 percent of all new commitments made by the EBRD in 1993 were in CEE countries. A quarter-century later, only a third of new EBRD investments in 2018 were in those countries, while Southeastern Europe and the Middle East and North Africa received 18 percent and 21 percent, respectively. Cumulatively, only about 37 percent of those commitments have gone toward the CEE countries, the Baltics, and the Caucuses.8 The initial impetus for the bank’s expansion into North Africa was the Arab Spring; Libya was of particular importance as shareholders considered an expansion of the bank’s geographic focus. Indeed, while Libya is tumultuous today, the EBRD would be ready to lead the reconstruction process when circumstances on the ground change positively. Figure 2: The EBRD’s Portfolio by Geographic Focus Russia has benefited the most from the establishment of the EBRD. In 1993, approximately 18 percent of the new commitments made by the EBRD were in Russia. Even though the country squandered the promise of a multiparty democracy with free market characteristics, and opted for authoritarianism and crony-capitalism, Russia was able to amass EBRD investments worth €24 billion (or $27 billion) —nearly one-fifth of all the commitments made by the EBRD. By the late-2000s, shareholders were becoming increasingly wary of the growing authoritarianism in Russia and its failure to adhere to EBRD principles of democracy. But after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, the shareholders—led by the United States—were left with no option but to stop the EBRD from making any new investments in Russia.9 Despite being the financial institution’s largest lending market, Russia’s dominance in the EBRD portfolio declined, with only €1.6 billion (or $1.8 billion) which is 6 percent of all investments) active in the region. The EBRD has been consistent with its principles in other countries as well. Following the 2005 Andijon Massacre, the bank closed down all its activities in Uzbekistan.10 Turkey—an upper-middle income country—has taken Russia’s place. Since 2014, Turkey has been the single largest country for EBRD investments. And while Turkey received 11 percent of new EBRD investments in 2018, it lost its top recipient status to Egypt.11 Over the years, the EBRD has made investments in four critical sectors: energy, financial services, infrastructure, and manufacturing and services (Figure 3). Given its founding mandate, the EBRD originally had a disproportionately large focus on the manufacturing and services sector, committing over 62 percent of its portfolio there. As global economic players recognized the bottleneck created by the lack of a well-developed and modernized infrastructure, the EBRD (much like its multilateral counterparts) increased its commitments to infrastructure and the energy sector. Between 1993 and 2018, investments in the infrastructure sector increased from 7 to 29 percent, while energy sector investments grew from 8 to 24 percent. Figure 3: EBRD’s Portfolio by Sector While the EBRD was originally founded as a development finance institution (DFI), it has recently added new forms of development instruments to its toolkits, including blended finance tools, sovereign finance instruments, research grants, and technical cooperation.12 To realize its development objectives, the EBRD uses three principle direct financing instruments: debt, equity investments, and guarantees. To date, over three-fourths (approximately 78 percent) of its commitments have been in the form of loans. Meanwhile, just about 13 percent of its commitments were made in the form of equity investments, and less than a tenth (9 percent) of its commitments went into guarantees and other de-risking instruments. Figure 4: EBRD Commitments by Instrument (1991-2018, Cumulative) The EBRD’s Impact and Legacy With over €130 billion invested cumulatively in more than 5,000 individual projects, the EBRD has played a central role in transitioning many of the post-Communist countries toward a more stable state of political and economic affairs. It has also helped Europe become more interdependent, reducing the scope and opportunities for political and security crises across the continent. The human impact of EBRD activities are also significant. For instance, more than 2,090 projects, worth €51.6 billion, have been undertaken between 1991 and 2018 to support and strengthen financial institutions and capital markets. By 2016, the EBRD had supported over 400,000 micro, small, and medium enterprises through local currency loans, while its larger infrastructure initiatives have upgraded the quality of life for nearly 60 million people. At a sovereign-level, member states have felt profound implications due to the EBRD and its activities. Of the 21 recipient countries who had joined the EBRD at its founding in 1991, 13 were classified as lower-middle income countries, while the other 8 countries were in the upper-middle income categories. Except Belarus, all the upper-middle income countries transitioned into the high-income category, while 8 of the lower-middle income countries have transitioned to the upper-middle income category. Only 6 original recipient countries have remained unchanged in their income classifications. Figure 5: Change in Country Classification The EBRD’s foundational commitment to private-sector and free-market development had helped many of the post-Communist economies in transition rely on the financial institution for technical assistance and support as they pursued market reforms. These included the liberalization of prices, privatization of key economic sectors, establishment of functioning banking and credit systems, design of legal frameworks that honored contracts and property rights, and boosts to investor confidence overall.13 As the EBRD helped drive market reform, countries such as the Czech Republic, Estonia, (formerly East) Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland made giant leaps and consolidated much of their reforms. Other countries, such as Croatia, Hungary, and Slovenia, made relatively slower, but steady, progress.14 To date, the Czech Republic is the only EBRD aid recipient that was deemed to have graduated from the EBRD, and it stopped receiving investments in 2008. By this time, the reform agenda had played out well in many of the post-Communist economies, which were enjoying the dividends paid by their investments in market institutions and free-enterprise systems. And even though the 2008 Global Financial Crisis rocked several European markets, the EBRD played an instrumental role in helping its member countries absorb the shocks and plan for the recovery. Challenges to Eurasian Prosperity The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 ushered in a new era of optimism for the champions of liberal democracies. Thirty years later, the international community confronts new and complex challenges to realizing lasting peace and prosperity. Meanwhile, the resurgence of authoritarian regimes in China and Russia has resulted in a multipolar geopolitical landscape. In that context, both bilateral and multilateral global development partners need to evaluate their strategic priorities and sharpen their efforts in order to be relevant and impactful. In the case of the EBRD, the following challenges need to be accounted for as the financial institution’s future directions are determined. i) The Russia Challenge in Eurasia The 2014 Russian invasion into Ukraine, which led to the annexation of Crimea, revealed the extent to which an authoritarian Russia was willing to undermine the sovereignty and security of the transatlantic community and a U.S. ally. In recent years, Russia has also stepped up its efforts to undermine the democratic and free-market institutions among European countr",2013-2017,6,high_conflict

Although vitally important, it is an investment area where China is outpacing the United States. China now dominates maritime trade in terms of volume, shipbuilding activity, and construction and ownership of ports around the world. China’s position puts U.S. economic interests and national security priorities at risk. A strategy to counter China’s influence in Global South ports is an important piece of a larger program to enable a better offer to the Global South. Actions include creating a port infrastructure strategy, promoting transparency in global port infrastructure procurement, and using other tools to better compete against China. Several policy recommendations are not unique to ports but apply to other infrastructure investment areas, such as undersea cables or digital architecture. China’s dominance of overseas ports is well established, but the U.S. policy response is lacking. This policy brief initiates a much-needed conversation and offers preliminary suggestions for consideration and further assessment. The Global South’s Demand for Port Infrastructure During the past 25 years, international trade patterns have shifted in favor of the Global South. Even though North-North trade is responsible for the biggest share of international trade (37.1 percent), South-South trade has increased by 14.1 percent since 1995, reaching a 25 percent share. Trade between developing countries has increased by an average annual rate of 9.8 percent since 2000, reaching $5.3 trillion in 2021. Over the same period, world trade grew at an annual rate of 5.5 percent. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 2024 World Economic Outlook, world trade is expected to increase by 3 percent in 2024 and by 3.3 percent in 2025. As a result, the demand for port infrastructure from the Global South will continue to rise as these countries seek to develop and integrate into global trade. Maritime transport is the backbone of international trade. Around 80 percent of the volume of international trade in goods is carried by sea; this figure is even greater for developing countries. Lower-income countries and small islands are 1.5 to 2 times more reliant on their ports for global trade than the global average. High-quality port infrastructure supports successful economic growth, especially in export-driven economies in developing regions. It attracts investment in production and distribution systems, supports the growth of manufacturing and logistics, and generates more employment. Port development supports supply chain diversification, which is particularly important in the face of shutdown due to accidents, pandemics, or wars. In 2000, the United States was the top trading partner for over 80 percent of countries. As of today, this figure has shrunk to 30 percent, while China has now become the top trading partner for more than 120 countries. China is South America’s top trading partner, and it is Africa’s largest trading partner in terms of total volume, dwarfing U.S.-Africa trade by a factor of four, according to the United States Institute of Peace. China’s Leadership in Port Infrastructure Within this context, China has significantly invested in the Maritime Silk Road (MSR) to increase trade route options and bypass choke points, posing a significant challenge for U.S. trade. In 2013, Chinese president Xi Jinping unveiled the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), an ambitious political-economic infrastructure initiative to link East Asia and Europe through land, sea and air under China’s leadership and with the backing of its resources. The twenty-first-century MSR is responsible for the BRI maritime routes that connect China to Europe and the Arctic Ocean via the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean. President Xi has repeatedly emphasized that economic powers must be maritime and shipping powers. As China now positions itself as the world’s top exporter, top shipbuilder, and largest trading nation, with around 95 percent of its international trade carried out through sea-lanes, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will soon dominate global maritime trade. The Indo-Pacific is a major hub of global commerce and will continue to be the main target for China’s maritime control. The 10 busiest container ports in the world are located along the shores of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The Indian Ocean hosts 80 percent of China’s imported oil and 95 percent of China’s trade with the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. China also has a strong presence in port construction in the developing world: it operates or has ownership of 91 active port projects across the globe where military use is a possibility, providing it with a foothold in every continent except Antarctica. These projects are part of the MSR network, which, according to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) State Council Information Office, has reached 117 ports across 43 countries, mostly in the Global South. China’s position of control and influence over the majority of port infrastructure globally poses a significant economic and military security threat to the United States. Simply put, China could use its power to interfere with operations that rely on port access—including military and economic operations—and are vital to U.S. interests. Ports are one strategic infrastructure investment area where China is outpacing the United States. In addition to technology, digital infrastructure, and energy infrastructure, China has made significant and strategic investments in ports that are highly connected to global trade networks and critical to the global flow of goods. It has invested in port projects in 16 of the top 20 countries or territories for shipping connectivity. Six of those countries are from the Global South: Egypt, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam. More than 27 percent of global container trade last year passed through terminals where leading Chinese and Hong Kong–based firms held direct stakes. China’s state-owned enterprises (SOEs) also dominate in financing, design, construction, and management of overseas port infrastructure. Between 2010 and 2019, Chinese companies invested roughly $11 billion into overseas ports. China’s two main SOEs involved in port infrastructure are COSCO Shipping Ports, the world’s largest shipping company and port terminal operator, operating and managing 371 berths globally, and China Merchants Ports, the sixth-largest port terminal operator globally. Additionally, the China Communications Construction Company Limited (CCCC) is the biggest port design and construction enterprise in the world. It shapes more than 70 percent of the national standards for the water transportation industry and designed 7 of the top 10 ports. State support to Chinese shipping companies in their endeavors totaled an estimated $132 billion between 2010 and 2018. Concerns about China’s Port Infrastructure China-backed infrastructure projects permeate the Global South. However, these projects often come with unsustainable financing terms, a lack of transparency, and a clear disregard for environmental and social norms. China even imports its workforce and prevents locals from profiting from the investment projects. In its first 10 years, cumulative BRI engagement surpassed $1 trillion, and the developing world amassed an estimated $385 billion in “hidden debt” to China. For each dollar of aid to low- and middle-income countries, China has provided $9 of debt. Sri Lanka has accumulated more than $8 billion in debt to Chinese SOEs, of which $1.1 billion was used to construct Hambantota Port. In 2017, when the Sri Lankan government was struggling to repay its debts, it had agreed to lease the port to China for 99 years in exchange for debt reduction. However, in 2024, Sri Lanka had to renegotiate its debt after it defaulted on its foreign loans in 2022. The situation raised concerns about China’s economic and geopolitical influence through predatory lending and the risks for smaller countries that undertake infrastructure deals with China. Similarly, as of 2022, Pakistan owed $23 billion to China. After large-scale borrowing, particularly in relation to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Pakistan is struggling to repay its debt and faces an economic crisis. These loans may have contained hidden terms that hinder Pakistan’s economy and force the country to depend on China. Although some analysis dismisses accusations of China’s debt-trap diplomacy, other issues surrounding Chinese lending remain, including lack of transparency, economic viability, social and environmental concerns, and wielding debt for political leverage. Additional concerns remain about China’s port infrastructure due to its potential dual use for commercial and military purposes. Out of the 70 commercial port projects in the Global South, an estimated 55 projects have the potential for naval use as well. That said, naval use is more likely to occur in ports where China owns the majority share—currently 10 port projects. There is growing reason for concern as Chinese port projects become more ambitious in terms of uses and strategic location. In 2017, China established its first overseas military base in Djibouti at the entrance of the Red Sea, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, six miles from a U.S. military base. There are concerns about similar attempts to establish a military presence in other parts of the Global South. U.S. officials suspect that China and Cambodia made a deal allowing Chinese armed forces to use Ream Naval Base, strategically located on the country’s southern coast facing the Gulf of Thailand, on the heels of elevated conflict with the Philippines and others in the South Sea. The Cambodian government has denied these accusations. Similarly, in the United Arab Emirates, China is accused of attempting to construct a clandestine military facility in the port of Khalifa, outside Abu Dhabi. China is also attempting to build a military base on the Atlantic coast of Africa. In addition to commercial and military use, port infrastructure could also be used for spying and intelligence gathering. With access to the business trade hubs, China could spy on U.S. commercial and military movements. A 2024 congressional probe showed communications equipment in Chinese-made cranes at U.S. ports, suggesting vulnerabilities to supply chains, trade data, and other sensitive information. China has secured a commanding position through Logink (also known as the National Transportation and Logistics Public Information Platform), a Chinese state-owned digital logistics platform. At least 24 ports worldwide have adopted the Logink system, which could allow China to access significant amounts of confidential information related to transportation, pricing, and management of goods (including military equipment), threatening U.S. economic and military security. China is also exporting container cranes from Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Company Limited (ZPMC). ZPMC dominates the global market for container cranes with a staggering 70 percent market share. For example, ZPMC manufactures 80 percent of the cranes used in U.S. ports; this includes 10 strategic seaports. These cranes come equipped with sensors that can track container details, which raises concerns about Chinese access to information about shipped goods, including U.S. military equipment. U.S. Activity in Port Infrastructure Today China strongly outperforms the United States in the financing, building, and management of ports. The United States has a limited number of ports, and its infrastructure is deficient and vulnerable to inclement weather. Currently, the United States has 208 commercial ports—up from 178 in 2010.

55,2013,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/western-balkans-chinese-characteristics,en,"The Western Balkans with Chinese Characteristics In 2012, China and 11 EU countries from Central and Southern Europe and 5 non-EU members from the Western Balkans met in Warsaw, Poland for the first time in a “16+1” format to deepen economic cooperation in the areas of infrastructure as well as information and green technological development. The occasion was marked by the signing of “China’s Twelve Measures for Promoting Friendly Cooperation with Central and Eastern European Countries” and the official launch of the 16+1. Seven years later in Dubrovnik, Croatia, the format has now grown to “17+1” with the inclusion of Greece. Nearly 40 bilateral deals were announced between China and partner countries, which included the opening of credit lines between the China Development Bank and Hungary worth €500 million, Croatia worth €300 million, Romania worth €100 million, Bulgaria worth €300 million, and Serbia worth €25 million. It could be suggested that this region was in fact an early test case for the Chinese government’s 2013 announcement of its global Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which envisions land and maritime transportation corridors stretching across and around the Eurasian landmass to Europe. Certainly, there was a strong infrastructure demand signal emanating from the region, which grew frustrated when its needs for new roads, modern ports, and high-speed rail went unmet by Western investment. Having developed the unique, mixed EU and non-EU 16+1 structure, Beijing could claim to be helping to “bridge” the EU and non-EU divide. It also gained a high-profile vehicle to channel a portion of the BRI’s $1 trillion in promised infrastructure investment. Even before the 16+1 format was created, EU member states in Central Europe have had mixed experiences with Chinese infrastructure investment. The quality of the Chinese materials and construction have been mixed, and local suppliers and labor have not received economic benefits. An example that still resonates within Poland is the failed construction of the A2 motorway by the China Overseas Engineering Group, a Chinese construction giant known as the COVEC Group. More recently, Chinese investment in telecommunications (e.g., Huawei) in this region has been more successful and substantive (including a recent announcement to invest nearly $793 million in Poland in the next five years) but faces increasing skepticism after two individuals, including the Chinese regional director of Huawei in Poland, were arrested and accused of spying for China. Creating a Chinese Investment Anchor in Serbia The non-EU Western Balkans members are increasingly targeted for BRI-related projects with the epicenter of Chinese investment being Serbia. In 2009, a “strategic partnership” between the Chinese and Serbian governments was officially established to include economic cooperation. In 2014, Serbia and China signed 13 agreements on technical and economic cooperation, which focused on financial, infrastructure, telecommunications, agriculture, and transport sectors. A decade later in 2019, the China Development Bank concluded an agreement with Serbia’s Postal Savings Bank for €25 million with two further memorandums of understandings between Belgrade and Beijing signed for further construction of road links. In total, infrastructure projects in Serbia are estimated to be around $10 billion. China’s flagship investment project in Serbia is a €3 billion high-speed railway connecting Belgrade to Budapest, which was awarded to a Chinese firm without open competition. An hour east of Belgrade, China financed and expanded a coal power plant that environmental and health advocates warn will saddle Serbia with a polluting power source for decades. Moreover, Serbia is fast becoming a favored stop along China’s digital silk road, the BRI’s digital dimension. In 2017, the Huawei signed an agreement to set up its “Safe City” surveillance equipment in select Serbian cities. In Belgrade, a surveillance system consisting of 1,000 high-definition cameras across 800 locations will use facial and license plate recognition software linked to a central database for law enforcement. China’s push into Serbia is about more than hard infrastructure. Complimenting Huawei's expanding relationship with Serbia is the One Thousand Dreams program, which will train 1,000 students across the 16 participating countries. There are currently more Chinese nationals in Belgrade than there are in most European cities, including tourists, businessmen, and employees of major Chinese companies. Chinese language schools are also present, including two Confucius Institutes in Belgrade and Novi Sad University. As part of the Safe City Solution , Belgrade will also host the Huawei Innovation Center for Digital Transformation, making the city a regional leader in digitization and focal point for future Huawei initiatives. Clearly, China has made Serbia its “anchor” investment in the Western Balkans, and its efforts to create other regional investments are gaining momentum. What Does This All Mean for the Western Balkans? Why was Beijing so interested in Central and Southern Europe and the Western Balkans and why were the majority of Chinese infrastructure and technology investments concentrated in the five non-EU countries of the Western Balkans? To better understand China’s position, it is helpful to break this analytical question down into means, motive, and opportunity. Means The ability for China to pursue these large investment opportunities lies in both the poor investment climate in the Western Balkans as well as in the shifting geostrategic environment. The Western Balkans represent fertile soil, characterized by economic stagnation, weak governance, corruption, and high unemployment rates on which BRI and Chinese state-owned companies can easily put down roots. According to Freedom House measurements, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina all saw a decline in their freedom index from 2018 to 2019. Only North Macedonia and Kosovo earned small improvements, but all 5 countries scored between 53 and 65—with 100 being the freest and 0 the least. Similarly, youth unemployment in the region was 35 percent in 2018, more than twice the EU average. While some EU member states in Central Europe also share these characteristics, the EU can be selectively more bureaucratically intrusive in member states. From China’s perspective, these conditions represent opportunity. The need for significant investment combined with a lack of competition from other foreign companies who are deterred by the questionable business environment and practices favors China. The fact that China has 7 out of the 10 largest construction contractors in the world, many of which benefit from state subsidies and scale, is an advantage. Additionally, China benefits from its large banks including the Export-Import Bank of China and the China Development Bank, which are willing to engage in riskier economic and political environments. Although Western Balkans states want to join the European Union, they know this path is far off, but elections are always near. In other words, there is an even greater need for economic renewal and an economic injection particularly for those leaders who have been in office for long stretches and require new political legitimacy. Chinese investment often does not require environmental assessments, transparency, or market viability, which are Western criteria for investment. Geopolitically since the 2008 global economic recession and subsequent migration crisis, leaders in the Western Balkans perceive that the West is internally focused and consumed allowing China to assume a more prominent global economic role. However, economic data does not bear this out. The European Union remains the largest provider of assistance to the region, and since 2007, the European Investment Bank has financed projects totaling €7 billion. Ultimately, Beijing reaps the commercial and political rewards of lavishing attention on an important but often-neglected region. Motive While exporting industrial overcapacity was a strong motivation behind BRI’s global design, it provides avenues for Beijing to exercise political influence, crowding out the United States, the European Union, and potentially in the future, Russia. In the longer term, Chinese engagement with the region and EU candidate countries may prove to be strategic should it produce greater future access to the European market. But with China’s growing economic role comes a political price for the bilateral relationships. For example, states were pressured by Beijing not to attend the State Department’s Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom or support an effort to criticize Beijing’s treatment of its Uyghur population. Opportunity China’s opportunity to take meaningful diplomatic and economic steps toward Serbia and the region began in the 2009 timeframe with the onset of the global economic crisis. A decade later, China has substantially enlarged its infrastructure and technology footprint across the region, which increases Chinese market access to approximately 18 million people. This growing economic footprint also allows for a dramatic increase of Chinese nationals and tourists travelling to the region and encourages greater cultural ties with university scholarships and other people-to-people exchanges. Although citizens in the region are beginning to ask questions about China’s growing economic and tourist presence, Serbian government officials in particular do not yet share their concerns. Officials need the investment and the technology to demonstrate economic vitality and diplomatic relevance without Western strings attached. Among regional leaders who are vulnerable to domestic political rivals, China could be seen as a safer and more reliable interim partner unless and until the geopolitical winds shift again toward the West. Through means, motive, and opportunity, China's expanding economic footprint and political avenues of influence in the Western Balkans have deepened, widened, and continue to emanate from Serbia with profound implications for the region’s economic development and long-term dependency.

58,2013,csis,https://www.csis.org/events/report-launch-other-side-world,en,"The U.S.-led order in the Middle East has enabled China to reap economic benefits without contributing to security costs. This dynamic could be in jeopardy if the Trump administration decides to shift towards a more transactional foreign policy in the region, argued experts at the launch of the CSIS Brzezinski Institute’s new report “The Other Side of the World” on April 24, 2017. Anne Gearan, the Washington Post’s political correspondent, moderated a panel discussion between the CSIS Brzezinski Chair and Middle East program director Jon Alterman, the CSIS Simon Chair in Political Economy Matthew Goodman, and the director of CSIS’s Alliances and American Leadership project, Andrew Shearer. China’s interests in the Middle East have developed in parallel with the country’s growing demand for natural resources and energy. China’s interests in the Middle East have developed in parallel with the country’s growing demand for natural resources and energy. As Goodman noted, for most regions of the world China’s exports dwarf its imports, but the opposite is true in the Middle East. While the United States moves ever-closer to energy independence, China remains dependent on the Middle East for more than half of its imported energy. Investment plays a critical role in China’s regional strategy. In 2013, President Xi Jinping unveiled the “Belt and Road Initiative,” which seeks to connect China and the rest of Eurasia through the construction and financing of ambitious infrastructure projects. Goodman estimated that China could spend up to $4 trillion on the initiative, which indicates the economic potential China sees in enhancing its westward commercial links. While the United States often adds stipulations, China is willing to do business with few, if any, strings attached. China’s activities in the Middle East reveal a new model of global influence, argued Alterman. Whereas the United States seeks to promote resilient societies as a means to building relationships, China predominantly pursues its economic interests through bilateral relations with other governments. This approach makes sense, Alterman noted, as China is almost always the more powerful partner in bilateral negotiations. Part of China’s broader strategy also includes deemphasizing its partners’ political and social issues in favor of promoting supposedly “win-win” economic relationships. While the United States often adds stipulations, China is willing to do business with few, if any, strings attached. China’s new model for global influence has only been possible because of the United States’ and its partners’ willingness to provide security, argued Shearer. Thanks to the United States’ efforts to foster multilateral institutions, China has not felt the need to build foreign military installments to secure its economic interests in the Middle East. The Chinese have started constructing multipurpose bases in the region, including a naval base in Djibouti. Shearer judged that China is building them in part to ensure military access to remote areas, and in part to keep an eye on U.S. Navy activities. He added that there was an additional, symbolic aspect to these installations, as China seeks carefully to expand its global footprint without provoking a strong reaction from local governments or the United States. The Chinese government will not be able to benefit forever from what one panelist called the “You do security, we do business,” paradigm. But panelists agreed the Chinese government will not be able to benefit forever from what one called the “You do security, we do business,” paradigm. China’s infrastructure projects in Afghanistan and Pakistan serve as a prescient example of the looming security challenges China will need to confront. As Alterman noted, where goods can cross borders, so can people, and China is facilitating travel between Southwest Asian areas that are battling extremism and the sometimes restive Muslim-majority areas of western China. Furthermore, the Trump administration’s professed skepticism of multilateral institutions throws doubt on the United States’ commitment to investing in the region’s security. Moving forward, China faces several other obstacles to its continued rise on the international stage. The panelists questioned the sustainability of China’s approach to its global interactions. China has championed a model, specifically in Africa, whereby it not only provides capital but also uses its own workers to implement infrastructure projects. Partnering governments have pushed back against China for extracting their resources without contributing to sustainable local development. While Goodman indicated that these complaints have prompted China to alter its strategy somewhat, the United States remains a more appealing partner for many. U.S. firms are viewed as reliable, willing to follow international regulations, and collaborative, often providing valuable training and technology transfer to local governments. At times, China’s weak investment in security capacity has also rendered it unable to influence global events. Alterman pointed to Libya as the prime example. With the unexpected fall of Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011, China had to rapidly evacuate 30,000 workers, presenting an unprecedented logistical challenge. China’s domestic problems could also impede its rise on the global stage. Goodman dispelled the notion that China could soon challenge the United States’ dominant position in the international order, stating that China’s power and influence should not be exaggerated. China still faces high levels of poverty in rural areas, and the government must combat pressing environmental issues. Moreover, China realizes that its current levels of growth are unsustainable unless it shifts towards a service-and-consumer-driven economy. The endurance of U.S. soft power will remain a lasting obstacle for China’s international ambitions, Alterman argued. Finally, the endurance of U.S. soft power will remain a lasting obstacle for China’s international ambitions, Alterman argued. The United States has strong people-to-people ties around the globe and is home to some of the most prestigious educational institutions in the world. People consume American culture, not Chinese. U.S. business and technology firms are the most attractive in the world and U.S. commercial brands are highly sought after. While China is undoubtedly a growing power in the Middle East, there are many challenges, both seen and unforeseen, that it must still navigate.",2013-2017,12,high_conflict

China has significantly expanded its bailout lending as its Belt and Road Initiative blows up following a series of debt write-offs, scandal-ridden projects and allegations of corruption. A study published on Tuesday shows China granted $104bn worth of rescue loans to developing countries between 2019 and the end of 2021. The figure for these years is almost as large as the country’s bailout lending over the previous two decades. The study by researchers at AidData, World Bank, Harvard Kennedy School and Kiel Institute for the World Economy is the first known attempt to capture total Chinese rescue lending on a global basis. Between 2000 and the end of 2021, China undertook 128 bailout operations in 22 debtor countries worth a total of $240bn. China’s emergence as a highly influential “lender of last resort” presents critical challenges for western-led institutions such as the IMF, which have sought to safeguard global financial stability since the end of the second world war. “The global financial architecture is becoming less coherent, less institutionalised and less transparent,” said Brad Parks, executive director of AidData at William & Mary in the US. “Beijing has created a new global system for cross-border rescue lending, but it has done so in an opaque and uncoordinated way.” Rising global interest rates and the strong appreciation of the dollar have raised concerns about the ability of developing countries to repay their creditors. Several sovereigns have run into distress, with a lack of co-ordination among creditors blamed for prolonging some crises. Sri Lanka’s President Ranil Wickremesinghe called on China and other creditors last week to quickly reach a compromise on debt restructuring after the IMF approved a $3bn four-year lending programme for his nation. China has declined to participate in multilateral debt resolution programmes even though it is a member of the IMF. Ghana, Pakistan and other troubled debtors that owe large amounts to China are closely watching Sri Lanka’s example. “[China’s] strictly bilateral approach has made it more difficult to co-ordinate the activities of all major emergency lenders,” said Parks. Several of the 22 countries to which China has made rescue loans — including Argentina, Belarus, Ecuador, Egypt, Laos, Mongolia, Pakistan, Suriname, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Ukraine and Venezuela — are also recipients of IMF support. However, there are big differences between IMF programmes and Chinese bailouts. One is that Chinese money is not cheap. “A typical rescue loan from the IMF carries a 2 per cent interest rate,” said the study. “The average interest rate attached to a Chinese rescue loan is 5 per cent.” Beijing also does not offer bailouts to all Belt and Road borrowers in distress. Big recipients of BRI financing, which represent a significant balance sheet risk for Chinese banks, are more likely to receive emergency aid. “Beijing is ultimately trying to rescue its own banks. That’s why it has gotten into the risky business of international bailout lending,” said Carmen Reinhart, a Harvard Kennedy School professor and former chief economist at the World Bank Group. China’s lending comes in two forms. The first is through a “swap line” facility, where renminbi is disbursed by the People’s Bank of China, the central bank, in return for domestic currency. About $170bn was disbursed in this way. The second is through direct balance of payments support, with $70bn pledged, mostly from state-owned Chinese banks. The BRI is the world’s largest-ever transnational infrastructure programme. The American Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based think-tank, has put the value of China-led infrastructure projects and other transactions classified as “Belt and Road” at $838bn between 2013 and the end of 2021. The bailout bonanza reveals shortcomings in the design of a scheme described by Chinese leader Xi Jinping as “the project of the century”. One issue, said Christoph Trebesch of the Kiel Institute, was that Chinese lenders “really went into many countries that turned out to have particularly severe problems”. Other deficiencies derived from a dearth of feasibility studies and a general lack of transparency, according to the study. Beijing pushed back on Tuesday against the criticisms of its foreign lending practices, with foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning telling reporters that China had entered financing agreements with developing countries “based on the principles of openness and transparency”. She added that China “has never compelled countries to take its loans, or ever attached political strings to such agreements”. Several projects became cause célèbre for how not to undertake development lending. An infamous $1bn “road to nowhere” in Montenegro remains unfinished and dogged by corruption allegations, construction delays and environmental issues. “White elephants” such as Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port and Lotus Tower are seen as symptoms of the country’s debt crisis, while more than 7,000 cracks were found in an Ecuadorean dam built by Chinese contractors near an active volcano.

When US President Donald Trump hosts his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping for dinner in Buenos Aires on Saturday, the stakes could not be much higher. It will be the first bilateral meeting between the two leaders since the start of the US-China trade war, which is set to escalate further in January if the two leaders fail to reach a deal this weekend. The dinner is widely perceived as the last chance to avert a broad-based economic clash that would likely last for at least two years, with ramifications for the global economy. Before the sideline meeting, Al Jazeera examines how the world’s two largest economies got here and what happens next. A competitive rivalry Trump’s hostility to Chinese economic policy dates back to his presidential campaign in 2016 and has been consistent over the past two years. He adopted a markedly different tone to those struck by previous American leaders, framing the US-China economic relationship as competitive and adversarial, rather than one that benefits both parties. In 2018, the Trump administration instigated a trade war on Beijing, imposing tariffs on a total of $250bn of Chinese imports. For its part, China has slapped tariffs on $110bn of US imports. On January 1, a 10 percent US tariff on $200bn of Chinese imports is due to increase to 25 percent, which would pose a much bigger problem for the affected industries. “A 10 percent tariff, businesses can kind of work around,” said Edward Alden, Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “The Chinese currency has fallen a little bit against the US dollar. Companies can maybe take a slight hit on their profit margin. Ten percent is manageable. Twenty-five percent is less manageable. It’s going to have a bigger real-world impact.” Trump also threatened this week to impose tariffs on a further $267bn worth of Chinese imports if the two sides fail to reach some kind of truce on Saturday, which could have a far wider effect on consumer goods. “If Trump goes forward with the next step, which is tariffs on the remainder of Chinese imports, then that hits directly a lot of consumer products, like smartphones and things that have so far been spared,” Alden said. Trump’s tough line on China has so far been popular among his political base and has commanded rare bipartisan support from the Republican and Democratic parties in the US Congress. Since he entered office, the US has been far more proactive and confrontational about addressing a long-standing list of grievances with China’s model for economic development, particularly in relation to technology. As a relative latecomer to industrialisation compared with the United States, China has borrowed, or from the US perspective “stolen”, much of the technology that it uses to advance its own industrial capabilities. The US charges that China has stolen trade secrets, violated patents, forced companies that are investing in China to share their technology with Chinese partners and hacked industrial targets. “These are all techniques the Chinese are using to move up the innovation ladder,” said Alden. “They want to be a leader in the next generation of technologies, from next-generation semiconductors, to electric vehicles, to artificial intelligence.” Beijing’s aspirations were outlined in its Made in China 2025 initiative, first announced in 2015, which charts a path for China’s economic development from the world’s factory to a global technology leader. Alden said the US sees such advancement as a potentially long-term security threat. “If China acquires the sort of technological leadership that it is seeking, it will pose a much greater military threat to the United States than it does now. So, economics and security are very much tied up here,” he said. China has defended its ambitions for more self-sufficiency, arguing that it needs to boost its own hi-tech capabilities in the face of restrictions on some imports from Western countries. The Trump administration has also blasted the US trade deficit with China, rallied against Chinese state subsidisation of industry and criticised its failure to open its domestic economy more for foreign investment. “I think the trade deficit is a symbol and it’s not the key thing. Economists can’t really agree on whether it’s important or not,” said Kerry Brown, associated fellow for the Asia-Pacific programme at Chatham House. “I think the issue is really about competition in technology and in other areas where China needs to be dealt with – that’s the attitude in America – that it’s got to now open up and reform itself much more,” Brown told Al Jazeera. “This idea of being a Marxist-Leninist state-led kind of market does not appeal to America and they want to see fundamental change there. That’s the difference. That’s the big broad issue. And I’m not sure that that can be resolved, certainly not in one meeting. That huge issue of competitive rivalry between China and America will not go away.” Heading towards a new Cold War? Alongside the tariffs, the US has also stepped up wider economic and geopolitical pressure on China this year, raising the prospect that this may be the start of a broad, multi-front confrontation similar to the Cold War between the US and Russia. In August, the US increased its export controls, restricting the sale of advanced technologies to China and also passed a new law that heavily curtails Chinese investment in the US technology sector. In September, the US placed sanctions on a branch of China’s military over its purchase of Russian military jets and surface-to-air missiles. Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence has intensified the confrontation with China in the geopolitical sphere, accusing Beijing of a number of alleged offences. In a stinging speech in October, he accused China of attempting to meddle in the US midterm elections, which China rejected, and criticised its military build-up in the South China Sea. At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in November, he mocked China’s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative as a “constricting belt” and a “one-way road” that amounted to a form of debt diplomacy and warned smaller countries not to take part. Speaking at the same event, China’s President Xi reiterated that Belt and Road was not a “trap”, nor did Beijing have a “hidden agenda”, while he also criticised “America First” trade protectionism. “What we are looking at here is not just a narrow trade war, but a broader economic war that is reminiscent of the sort of tactics that the United States used against the Soviet Union during the Cold War,” said Alden. In advance of Saturday’s dinner, both sides have expressed openness to the prospect of a deal. But the US has also threatened to expand its tariffs to cover all Chinese imports if Beijing does not agree to its demands. Serious doubts remain as to whether Beijing will make the kinds of concessions that Washington is demanding. “The chance of any deal between the US and China being done at the G20 is very low,” said Duncan Innes-Ker, regional director for Asia and Australasia at the Economist Intelligence Unit. “US officials have been downplaying hopes for a resolution and the back-channel discussions that would usually precede a breakthrough have mostly foundered.” Innes-Ker added, however, that the “situation involving Donald Trump is inherently unpredictable, so a surprise agreement is possible. If that does happen, there is a high risk that the deal will subsequently fall apart.” Brown said the best-case-scenario may be some kind of framework for a “limited, pragmatic deal”. “And then they can play this, separately, as a victory for each other. The best outcome is that they both come away thinking that they’ve won.”",2013-2017,18,high_conflict

China is hosting a two-day regional security summit attended by Russia, Iran and other allies confronting rising tensions with the United States over trade and its unilateral withdrawal from a multinational nuclear deal with Iran. Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday opened the 18th annual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) – an eight-member grouping led by Beijing and Moscow – in the coastal city of Qingdao. Russian President Vladimir Putin, Pakistan’s President Mamnoon Hussain and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi were among those attending, as were representatives from four ex-Soviet Central Asian republics – Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Delivering his opening remarks on Saturday, Chinese leader Xi said: “Tomorrow we will hold the first summit of the SCO after its expansion and draw up a blueprint for its future growth.” “The Qingdao summit is a new departure point for us,” he added. “Together, let us hoist the Shanghai spirit, break waves and embark on a new journey for our organisation.” Trade, investment and development cooperation issues will feature prominently at the SCO meeting. China’s “Belt and Road” project will also be discussed – a trade programme that spans more than 60 countries across Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Africa. Iran urges more nuclear talks The SCO meeting comes after US President Donald Trump controversially pulled Washington out of the 2015 international pact with Iran that placed limits on its nuclear programme in return for the easing of economic sanctions. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday he wanted more talks with Russia about what he called the “illegal” US withdrawal. Speaking on the sidelines of the Qingdao summit before meeting Putin, Rouhani said the US exit from the nuclear accord warrants an “important and serious discussion between our two countries”. Rising tensions with the US after it announced tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico are also expected to be on the bloc’s agenda over the next two days. Differences over trade between the US and its key allies dominated proceedings at the ongoing G7 summit in Canada. Einar Tangen, a political and economic affairs commentator, said the SCO serves as a “big counterpoint” to the G7. “It’s a tale of two summits – the best of times and the worst of times,” he told Al Jazeera. “A lot of people will be looking at the differences between these two summits in terms of the style and substance and this is very important as the world is wondering what the shape will be. “A lot of businesses are not putting their investments in because they are not certain of the future.”",2013-2017,3,high_conflict
81,2015,aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2018/9/2/trade-deficit-tops-china-africa-summit-in-beijing,en,"Trade deficit tops China-Africa summit in Beijing Key conference in China comes amid criticism of Beijing’s debt-laden approach in dealing with developing nations. African leaders gather for a two-day summit in Beijing focused on economic ties with China amid increasing criticism of its debt-laden approach to aid in the developing world. President Xi Jinping hosts leaders from more than 50 African countries for the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation starting on Monday. The once-every-three-year conference typically sees China dole out large loan packages for the continent. Xi announced $60bn in assistance and loans for Africa during the last summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2015. China’s economic data shows trade between Beijing and the continent’s countries rose 14 percent last year to $170bn. Participants at this week’s summit are looking for ways to “advance common growth and development”, South Africa’s Foreign Minister Lindiwe Sisulu said. Beijing has been Africa’s biggest trading partner over the last decade, and its resources have helped fuel China’s transformation into the world’s second-largest economy. But most African nations – exporting minerals and buying Chinese manufactured goods – run large deficits with China. “The question of the trade imbalance is one that I think will be placed firmly on the table by the African delegates,” Sim Tshabalala, chief executive of South Africa’s Standard Bank Group, told reporters on Saturday. Africa is in the middle of a boom in infrastructure projects, managed and cheaply financed by China. Some Chinese manufacturers are expanding to Africa, but the bulk of Chinese investment goes into mining or construction of roads and other infrastructure. The continent is an important part of Xi’s Belt and Road initiative – a plan to bolster a network of infrastructure connecting China by land and sea to Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Africa. China has pledged $126bn for the plan, which has been praised by its supporters as a source of vital financing for the developing world. ‘Debt trap’? Critics say Africa is loading itself up on Chinese debt that countries may struggle to repay, with estimates ranging in the tens of billions of dollars. That could leave African nations with no choice but to hand over controlling stakes in strategic assets to China. Last week, China’s Vice Commerce Minister Qian Keming said Africa’s debt burden was long-standing and had been made worse by the global financial crisis and a slump in commodity prices. “When it comes to the debt problem, there really is not that much Chinese debt in Africa,” said Qian. “Overall, according to the statistics that I have, the majority of the debt burden is not necessarily created by China,” he added without giving details. His comments echoed remarks by a senior official at China’s state planning commission who said loans provided under the Belt and Road initiative were not a “debt trap”. As well as trade and investment, China sees African nations as key security partners. Beijing opened its first overseas naval base in the Horn of Africa country of Djibouti last year – a signal of the continent’s strategic importance to China.",2013-2017,17,high_conflict

Chinese and African officials have rejected criticism of Beijing’s development projects on the continent as they ended a summit that included a $60bn pledge for more aid to the continent. President Xi Jinping hosted leaders from across Africa amid questions about whether his country’s Belt and Road global trade infrastructure initiative is worsening debt problems in some countries. “Everything we do with China is perfectly under control, including on the financial and debt side,” Senegal’s President Macky Sall said on Tuesday at the end of the two-day summit. “We shouldn’t let our conscience be disturbed by criticism made regarding the nature of our relations with China,” Sall said. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said one of the summit’s main achievements was an agreement to “work hard to increase Africa’s value-added exports to China”. For his part, Xi said the summit “opened a new chapter in the history of China-Africa relations”. Debt forgiveness On the opening day of the summit on Monday, Xi offered $60bn in financial support to African countries over the next three years. He said the debt of the continent’s poorest nations will be written off. The Chinese president said the figure included $15bn in grants, interest-free loans and concessional loans, a credit line of $20bn, $10bn for “development financing” and $5bn to buy imports from the continent. Chinese companies will be encouraged to invest no less than $10bn in African countries in the next three years, he added. The money comes on top of $60bn offered at the last summit in 2015. China’s special envoy for African affairs, Xu Jinghu, said Beijing would be “very conscientious” in its cooperation with Africa and conduct feasibility studies before choosing projects. “China has not increased the debt burden of Africa,” she told reporters. Costly aid Xi’s cherished Belt and Road project has already seen China loan billions of dollars to countries in Asia and Africa for roads, railways, ports and other infrastructure projects. Critics have warned that the Chinese leader’s pet project is burying some countries under massive debt. Beijing loaned around $125bn to African nations between 2000 and 2016, according to data from the China-Africa Research Initiative at Washington’s Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. A study by the Center for Global Development, a US think-tank, found “serious concerns” about the sustainability of sovereign debt in eight Asian, European and African countries receiving Chinese funds. Locals in some countries have complained about the practice of using Chinese labour for building projects and what are perceived to be sweetheart deals for Chinese companies. The concerns are likely to grow as countries in other parts of the world begin to question whether Chinese aid comes at too high a price. “Time has come for African leaders to critically interrogate their relationship with China,” an editorial in Kenya’s Daily Nation said on Monday.",2013-2017,15,high_conflict
83,2015,aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2019/10/13/china-nepal-sign-trade-infrastructure-and-security-deals,en,"China, Nepal sign trade, infrastructure and security deals China’s Xi also pledges financial aid as he becomes first Chinese leader to visit Nepal in more than 20 years. President Xi Jinping has wrapped up a landmark visit to Nepal, the first by a Chinese president in 23 years, with 20 deals signed and nearly $500m in financial aid pledged amid Beijing’s growing influence in the impoverished Himalayan nation. After talks in the capital, Kathmandu on Sunday, Xi and Nepalese Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli witnessed the signing of 18 agreements and two letters of exchange in areas of connectivity, security, border management, trade, tourism and education. Along with a Chinese delegation, Xi arrived in Kathmandu from Chennai on Saturday for the start of his two-day state visit after meeting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He departed for Beijing on Sunday. Nepal’s Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali described Xi’s visit as one of “historic significance” for Nepal. “Our priority is to create opportunities for Nepal, joining it to China’s development. We are focusing on connectivity between the two countries,” he said. In a signed article published in Nepali newspapers on Friday, Xi said he would use the two-day visit to “renew friendship and explore cooperation with my Nepali friends”. “It is important that we adopt a strategic and long-term perspective and draw up a blueprint for our bilateral relationship to take it to a new height in this new era,” Xi added. During delegation-level talks with President Bidhya Devi Bhandari on Saturday, Xi announced 56 billion rupees ($492m) in economic assistance for Nepal over the next two years, an official told the Kathmandu Post on condition of anonymity. Separate deals for a trans-Himalayan railway link to Tibet and a tunnel were reached on Sunday. The 70-km (42-mile) rail link will connect Gyiron in Tibet with Nepal’s capital city of Kathmandu, making it one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in the country. Key geopolitical actor Landlocked Nepal, geographically sandwiched between India and China, is seeking closer ties and much-needed energy and infrastructure investment from Beijing. Asian giants India and China have both sought to woo Nepal and have poured in aid and infrastructure investment. In 2017, Nepal signed up to China’s Belt and Road initiative, a vast global infrastructure programme, which includes the building or upgrading of highways and airports in the country. Although India has traditionally been Nepal’s main ally, China has intensified its presence, pumping millions of dollars into projects ranging from roads to hydropower plants. Lok Raj Baral, a former Nepalese ambassador to India, said Nepal has to be “very cautious” and maintain a “good balance” between the two neighbours. “Nepal is very important from a geopolitical point of view, it’s location itself is very important, which is why we should be very careful,” he told Al Jazeera in a phone interview from Kathmandu. “We cannot play one neighbour against the other.” ‘Political costs’ India has extensive influence on Nepal’s economy and politics, while China and Nepal share a border covered with high mountain peaks. A prolonged blockade of its border crossings with India in 2015 and 2016 left Nepal short of fuel and medicine for months. According to Manoj Kewalramani, a fellow for China Studies at the Bangalore-based Takshashila Institution, smaller states like Nepal see China as an opportunity to “hedge what they might see as India’s excessive influence” in the region. “From an Indian point of view, I would say these are signs of how things are changing for India in the neighbourhood,” he said of Xi’s visit. “We need to accept the fact that China is much more active and expressively intent through actions of wanting Nepal to [move from being] landlocked to land-linked, and that link has to come through China,” he told Al Jazeera in a phone interview. He noted, however, that there are “certain political costs” attached to Beijing’s increased investment. “This is an opportunity to develop and to attract investment for the betterment of the economy, but there are risks with that and it’s about the dexterity of your foreign policy to be able to manage some of these risks and that’s the challenge.” Additional reporting by Saba Aziz: @saba_aziz",2013-2017,5,high_conflict
84,2015,aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2019/11/11/greece-and-china-hail-strategic-partnership-as-us-and-eu-look-on,en,"Greece and China hail strategic partnership, as US and EU look on Greece is attempting to be China’s gateway to Europe, with Athens offering Beijing plenty of investment opportunities. Athens, Greece – Greek leaders on Monday hailed Chinese President Xi Jinping‘s first official visit to Greece as a “new era” in what is an already close trade and investment relationship being closely watched by the United States and the European Union. “Greece recognises China not only as a great power but also as a country that has won for itself, not without difficulty, a leading geostrategic economic and political role,” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told Xi. Greece is eager to play a greater role in China‘s overseas development. During the visit, the two countries’ delegations signed 16 memorandums of cooperation, the most important of which outline new Chinese energy investments in Greece. One establishes an Athens branch of the Industrial and Commerical Bank of China to finance renewable energy projects. Another facilitates a 50-megawatt solar power station on the island of Crete being built with technical expertise from the China Energy Engineering Group. In an editorial published before his arrival, Xi laid out his vision for increased cooperation “in all areas”. “China and Greece must together promote the building of a new type of international relationship based on respect, justice and mutually beneficial cooperation,” he wrote. The ‘head of the dragon’ Greece-China relations took off this year when the four-month-old conservative New Democracy government approved 611.8 million euros ($67m) in Chinese investments that had been frozen for 18 months under the left-wing Syriza government. Over the coming five years, the investments, referred to as the “master plan”, will bring to almost $3bn the amount the state-owned China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO) will have spent on the port of Piraeus, China’s signature investment in Greece, and one which Xi refers to as “the head of the dragon”. COSCO has been developing Piraeus as an entry and transhipment point for Chinese-manufactured goods for a decade. Its strategic advantage to container shipping over the ports of northern Europe is that it saves a week’s sailing and almost $2m per trip. That makes it a crucial link in China’s Belt and Road initiative – a series of hundreds of infrastructure projects aiming to lower the cost of Chinese exports to Europe and Africa. Thanks to COSCO’s investments, container throughput at Piraeus rose from 685,000 in 2010 to five million containers last year. Piraeus will this year become the Mediterranean’s biggest container port, and by some estimates handles 10 percent of Chinese commodities exported to Europe; but that no longer seems enough. Mitsotakis and COSCO chairman Xu Lirong outlined a bigger vision in Shanghai on November 4. “We intend to make Piraeus the biggest port in Europe, and the master plan ensures that we will succeed,” said Xu. “We want to make Piraeus a global trans-shipment centre on the Singapore model.” This openly pits Piraeus against the likes of Hamburg and Rotterdam, and would likely cost billions in additional rail and port infrastructure. “Any port is as good as its connections to the hinterland. Thanks to excellent hinterland connections by river, road, rail and pipelines, Port of Rotterdam is Europe’s biggest port, both in total throughput as well as in container handling,” Port of Rotterdam spokesman Leon Willems told Al Jazeera in a written statement. “In the coming months, we expect container throughput to pass the 15 million a year milestone. It is not for Port of Rotterdam to determine whether other ports can copy this achievement, nor how they envisage to surpass this,” he said. Natural allies In maritime trade, Greece and China seem to have a natural area of cooperation. “We are a nation of seafarers,” Mitsotakis said at the China International Import Expo in Shanghai on November 5. “Greeks control 25 percent of the world’s oceangoing merchant fleet. The synergies with China, the world’s biggest export economy, are obvious.” By investing in Piraeus, China is helping to realise a decades-long dream of Greek shipowners to create a cluster of shipping services such as ship management, ship repair, finance and insurance. The benefits go both ways. Chinese banks have extended $3bn in loans to Greek shipowners to build ships in Chinese shipyards. Mitsotakis said Greeks had built more than a thousand ships in Chinese shipyards over the past 15 years, worth over $50m. “Mitsotakis is highlighting … how open Greece is for business, how much it has diversified, opened its sectors, laying out the red carpet, and in doing this he is sending a message to others,” says Jens Bastian, an independent economist and China expert. “If the Chinese are doing this, then the Americans can also do it, the French, the Germans, the Swiss, the Italians can do it. He means to address other constituencies in other countries.” But some analysts warn that, for all its warmth, the Greece-China relationship is also highly asymmetrical. Compare the overall worth of all those commodities with what is going into Greek state coffers and you'll see that there's a huge gap “On the basis of calculations we’ve made … I think the Greek side may not be gaining more than one percent of the overall benefits to be drawn from [Piraeus],” says Plamen Tonchev, who heads the China Unit at the Institute for International and Economic Relations in Athens. “Think of the worth of the content of each container. We may be talking about 30-40bn euros’ [$33bn-$44bn] worth of all these commodities [entering Europe every year]. Compare the overall worth of all those commodities with what is going into Greek state coffers and you’ll see that there’s a huge gap between those two figures.” COSCO has raised Piraeus’ turnover by a third and its profitability fourfold. Last year it paid $11m in dividends, of which 24 percent went to the state. Political ramifications Although it approved COSCO’s buyout of the Piraeus Port Authority (PPA) in 2016, the European Commission has also expressed its reservations about Chinese influence in Greece. This influence was most clearly suggested under the Syriza government, which came to power in 2015 to end austerity policies the Eurozone had been imposing on Greece since 2010. Syriza tried and failed to fund the government through large-scale lending from Russia and China, hoping this would counterbalance the leverage held by the Eurozone, which owns about two-thirds of Greek debt. Perhaps as part of this effort, Syriza appeared to volunteer a political alignment with China. In June 2016, shortly after the PPA sale, Greece blocked a joint EU statement calling on China to respect the International Law of the Sea. China had just lost an arbitration brought by the Philippines to the International Court of Justice at The Hague over fishing rights in the Spratly Islands – a disputed territory between the two. Croatia and Slovenia also opposed the statement, but it was the objection of Greece, a more senior EU member and traditional defender of the Law of the Sea, that raised eyebrows. Responding to questions of political influence, then-Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias lashed out at other EU member states with larger Chinese investments: “For them, it’s business as usual, but if we sell something it affects our political stance. This is hypocrisy and doublespeak and I have told them so.” A year later, Greece again raised hackles at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, when it blocked an EU statement calling on China to respect freedom of speech. It was the first time the EU failed to make its unanimous annual statement. Kotzias’ position here was even more startling: “I respect that the Chinese have a different opinion on human rights … Are human rights as the West perceives them generally applicable? Or do some people have a different understanding? One has to respect that. We believe that they are generally applicable. But not everyone believes what we believe.” Greece has consistently called upon others, especially neighbouring Turkey, to respect international maritime law and human rights. Its modification of both standards within a year was unprecedented. New Democracy has done the opposite to Syriza: It has released COSCO funds to complete most of its investments but reaffirmed Greece’s Western orientation. Still, the US is wary. During a visit to Athens last month, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned the Greeks against China. Sometimes, he said, “a country shows up with a facially commercial product, but it turns out that that product is being offered for political interest.” He especially warned Greece against buying 5G telecommunications technology from China. “You’re showing up to provide maybe a telecommunications network because you want your communist party to be able to steal all the information that going to move across that network,” Pompeo said. Greece needs the US and EU... And China doesn't have a role to play in this geopolitical equation Mitsotakis is treading a fine line between old and new allies, as he strives to maintain stability and deliver on his promise of growth and jobs. During his visit to Shanghai last month, the government said it was in talks with Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE to build a factory in Greece to manufacture telecoms equipment. But Tonchev believes Greece’s political flirtation with China is over. “Greece needs the US and EU,” he says. “There’s a lot of tension in the eastern Mediterranean. There’s an unpredictable Turkey next door. And China doesn’t have a role to play in this geopolitical equation.” China is, however, unquestionably going to great lengths to buy a long-term position in Greece. And the fact that this investment began during a decade when Greece’s economy shrank by a quarter due to austerity, makes the bond all the stronger. “Your company and China as a whole believed and invested in my country when many felt that investment prospects in Greece were nonexistent,” Mitsotakis told Xu in Shanghai. He appeared to complete the sentence a week later, as he told Xi in Athens: “Now that our country is developing again, it is regaining a leading role, a leading position, not only in our broader neighbourhood but also in Europe as a whole. We are not merely partners. We are broadening our common goals.”",2013-2017,16,high_conflict
85,2015,aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2019/8/8/china-to-bail-out-venezuelas-refineries-in-exchange-for-oil,en,"China to bail out Venezuela’s refineries in exchange for oil If Venezuela’s fuel production is restored quickly enough, the US economic blockade could be weakened. A Chinese contractor has agreed to shore up Venezuela’s derelict refining network to ease fuel shortages, potentially complicating the Trump administration’s push for regime change in the oil-rich country. Wison Engineering Services Co., a Shanghai-based chemical engineering and construction company that is using China’s ‘Belt and Road’ infrastructure program to expand overseas, agreed last month to repair Venezuela’s main refineries in exchange for oil products including diesel, according to people with knowledge of the deal. U.S. financial sanctions aimed at starving the current regime of revenue contributed to the decision to revive a domestic refining industry crippled by years of mismanagement and under-investment, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is confidential. The deal mirrors the OPEC producer’s other arrangements with Russian and Chinese oil majors, under which payments are made in crude by Venezuela’s cash-strapped national oil company. Wison’s repairs are expected to last six months to a year, according to another person. The Nicolas Maduro administration was having difficulties navigating the U.S. economic blockade even before the U.S. announced additional restrictions on Aug. 5. Last month state-controlled Petroleos de Venezuela SA was importing Russian gasoline through Malta to relieve shortages, a slow and expensive route to the Caribbean nation. Irregular Supply Irregular fuel supplies have crippled mobility in a country where shortages of food and basic medical supplies have already caused a health crisis and led to one of the largest mass migrations of recent times. PDVSA, as the state producer is known, has been directing most available gasoline to Caracas, where Maduro is most vulnerable to mass protests. The Trump administration was hoping to swiftly chase Maduro out of power earlier this year, and has criticized China and Russia for supporting what it considers a criminal and repressive regime. Wison didn’t respond to an email or fax seeking comment on the refinery contract. PDVSA didn’t respond to emails and calls seeking comment. The Chinese company hasn’t completed a contract it won in 2012 to overhaul the Puerto la Cruz refinery. Wison’s revenue from Venezuela sank 72% last year as the nation’s economic crisis deepened, according to its annual report. China and Russia have an interest in preventing the complete collapse of Venezuela’s oil industry because it’s the only way to recoup the tens of billions of dollars in loans and investments they have made in the past decade. Wison’s deal also underscores how the oil-hungry Asian nation remains committed to Venezuela as a strategic location for foreign investment. Economic Blockade Restoring fuel production, if it happens fast enough, would weaken the U.S. economic blockade and put Maduro in a stronger negotiating position as talks with the opposition drag on without any visible progress. Despite Venezuelans’ widespread dissatisfaction with their government, divisions within the opposition are complicating the push toward a post-Maduro administration. While about 50 nations recognize National Assembly President Juan Guaido as the country’s interim president, China has declined to get involved in what it considers an internal conflict. Venezuela’s refining industry, once a major supplier to the U.S. with 1.3 million barrels a day of capacity, has been in gradual decline due to theft, inadequate maintenance and a brain drain of qualified staff, and was hit by a series of major power outages this year. In recent years, PDVSA hasn’t even been able to meet domestic gasoline demand that has historically been about 250,000 barrels a day. The U.S. has so far shied away from military intervention in Venezuela and has instead imposed economic sanctions that target the oil industry and key members of the government and the military.

China‘s President Xi Jinping will visit Myanmar on Friday to ink massive infrastructure deals and extend influence in a neighbouring country whose ties with the West were frayed by accusations that it conducted genocidal policies against ethnic Muslim-majority Rohingya people. This is Xi’s first visit to the Southeast Asian country as the leader of China – and the first visit of any Chinese president in 19 years. Analysts say Xi will bid to revive stalled multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects central to his flagship Belt and Road Initiative, which is described as a “21st-century Silk Road”.

Historically, the two countries have had a sometimes fraught relationship, with many in Myanmar suspicious of the tremendous sway that China holds over its smaller neighbour. Relations have warmed since China avoided joining in the international condemnation of Myanmar after a military campaign in 2017 forced more than 730,000 Rohingya to flee across the border to Bangladesh. United Nations officials said the Myanmar military offensive was executed with “genocidal intent”. For its part, Myanmar says the killing was a legitimate counter-insurgency operation launched after militant attacks on security forces. A permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has defended Myanmar on the global stage and is viewed as the biggest obstacle to the prosecution of its leaders at an international war crimes tribunal. China is the second-biggest investor in Myanmar, behind only Singapore, according to data published by the World Bank. Myanmar’s exports to China, its largest trading partner, were worth $5.5bn in 2018, while imports were worth $6.2bn. “No other country is investing in Myanmar except China,” said Hla Kyaw Zaw, a political analyst based in Yunnan Province on the Myanmar-China border. “China can negotiate a good deal with Myanmar,” she said. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui told reporters in Beijing on Friday that the purpose of the visit was to strengthen relations and deepen Belt and Road Initiative cooperation. A third goal of the visit, he said, was to “materialise” the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, a plan for a Y-shaped corridor of projects connecting China with the Indian Ocean. “Preparations are under way, and you will see the historic outcomes and influence of this historic visit,” Luo said. ‘Like water in their hands’ Chinese and Myanmar flags fluttered side by side along the roads in Naypyitaw on Thursday ahead of Xi’s arrival, alongside banners bearing his portrait. Municipal staff cleaned the roads and tended to the gardens, while some hotels hung welcoming signs. Chinese authorities, including the ministry of information and embassy, have organised a series of events celebrating the Myanmar-China relationship, which marks its 70th anniversary this year, in the commercial capital of Yangon in recent days. At one event on Tuesday, Myanmar’s Minister for International Cooperation Kyaw Tin acknowledged concerns over the relationship before Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party came to power after a landslide election win in 2015. “But the relationship between Myanmar and China is stronger and closer than before, and we are building trust between our countries,” he said. “It will be a very successful visit. It will bring lots of benefits.” Even so, Chinese megaprojects carry political risk in Myanmar, and are viewed as wrecking the environment and causing large-scale displacement of villagers. On the agenda at the weekend’s talks are expected to be a deep-sea port in Rakhine State that was scaled down in 2018 over fears of a debt trap and a now-suspended Chinese-backed $3.6bn mega-dam in the northern Kachin State. The dam project would have flooded an area the size of Singapore and displaced tens of thousands of people. While Suu Kyi, a longtime democracy activist and Nobel laureate, once publicly criticised the dam, more recently she has urged ethnic Kachin people to keep an open mind. Lu Ra, a villager forced to leave her land to make way for the project after construction started in 2009, said she feared China would pressure Myanmar to renew the project. “We are like water in their hands,” she said.",2013-2017,10,high_conflict

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has new powers to veto or scrap agreements that state governments reach with foreign powers under laws that could stymie China’s Belt and Road Initiative in Australia and further inflame tensions between the trading partners. The laws passed by Parliament on Tuesday will give the foreign minister the ability to stop new and previously signed agreements between overseas governments and Australia’s eight states and territories, and with bodies such as local authorities and universities.

An early target is likely to be an agreement the Victoria state government signed in 2018 to join President Xi Jinping’s signature infrastructure-building BRI. The laws could further worsen ties between Australia and its largest trading partner, which have been in free fall since April, when the prime minister called for an independent probe into the origins of the coronavirus. Beijing has since inflicted a range of trade reprisals, including imposing crippling tariffs on Australian barley and wine while blocking coal shipments. Relations hit a fresh low last week when a Chinese diplomat tweeted an image purporting to show an Australian soldier holding a knife to the throat of an Afghan child. After Morrison called for an apology for the “repugnant” post, a senior Chinese Foreign Ministry official dismissed the demand, questioning whether the Australian leader “lacks a sense of right and wrong.” A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs late Tuesday urged Canberra to take “an objective and logical view on the ‘Belt and Road’ initiative and refrain from creating obstacles that prevent normal communication between China and Australia.” Mounting Concerns Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters last week his government wasn’t considering withdrawing from its BRI agreement due to the worsening ties, the Australian Associated Press reported. China’s cooperation with Victoria on BRI has brought benefits to both sides, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in August. “Australia should have an objective view of such cooperation and BRI, and not set up impediments for China-Australia cooperation.” Beyond the BRI deal signed by Victoria, which aims to increase Chinese participation in new infrastructure projects, the law may allow the federal government to review and overturn memorandums of understanding between Beijing and the governments of Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania in sectors ranging from investment, science cooperation and access to the Antarctic. The states and territories have at least 130 agreements across 30 nations that could be affected by the new law, according to Morrison. The law will establish a public register to provide transparency to the foreign minister’s decisions and states and territories will be given three months to deliver a stock-take of their existing agreements. Partnerships between Australian universities and Beijing-sponsored bodies could be scrapped. There is mounting concern in intelligence circles about China’s influence in universities, and a program under which academics sign over intellectual property rights to their work in return for research grants, the Australian newspaper reported in April. Under the law, Morrison won’t be able to scrap deals between state governments and commercial companies or state-owned enterprises. That means the lease of a strategic port in Darwin, used by the U.S. military, to a Chinese company by the Northern Territory government in 2015 could not be overturned. It’s the latest move by the government to safeguard national interests. Morrison also plans to toughen foreign investment screening, regardless of the size of the deal, for sectors such as telecommunications, energy and technology.",2013-2017,5,high_conflict
88,2015,aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2022/10/14/analysis-does-chinas-palace-diplomacy-benefit-africa,en,"Analysis: Does China’s ‘palace diplomacy’ benefit Africa or Beijing? China’s practice of gifting million-dollar buildings to governments across Africa is under renewed scrutiny. On June 30, Zimbabwe’s new $140m parliamentary building, built and financed by China, was unveiled in the capital Harare as a gift from Beijing. The imposing structure, which sits on 33,000 square metres and comprises a six-storey office complex and rooms for MPs and staff, is the latest example of Beijing’s heightened charm offensive towards African governments. “The project strongly supports democracy in Zimbabwe while boosting the country’s image,” Shanghai Construction Group manager Libo Cai stated at the time. Zimbabwean Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa said the new building symbolised “deep relations” between Harare and Beijing. For years, China has cultivated relationships with African states, handing out low-interest loans and fiscal interventions without the usual human rights concerns that accompany offers by Western governments. It has also been building or renovating government offices at its own expense or practising “palace diplomacy”, as some foreign policy buffs have been calling it in recent years. Aside from Zimbabwe, several countries, including Mozambique, Lesotho, Guinea-Bissau and Malawi now have new parliaments courtesy of Beijing since the turn of the millennium. Burundi got a $22m presidential palace that was completed in 2019. That same year, the Liberian government opened two annexes to its parliamentary building — the Capitol — and a new ministerial complex, both donated by China. In Tanzania, a leadership academy was recently opened with construction generously supported by Beijing. According to a 2020 study by the Washington, DC-based Heritage Foundation think tank, at least 186 government buildings in Africa have been at least partially financed and built by China. That number has grown rapidly over the past two decades as China’s economy has become more robust, and Beijing has thus been willing to wield the soft power it can afford. For many Africans, these gifts seem pretty normal, harmless even. A Chinese agenda Jinghan Zeng, professor of China and International Studies at Lancaster University, agrees with that perspective. “This so-called ‘Palace-Diplomacy’ sits in the wider Chinese involvement in infrastructure in Africa given the continent’s huge demand for infrastructure and little financing to bring projects to fruition,” he told Al Jazeera. “The reason why [government buildings] become a key focus is partly shaped by the way China engages with Africa,” he added. “It is state-focused, and thus those plans are largely shaped by the desire of local state actors.” Some analysts have argued that these massive projects, being so publicly visible, serve as a sign of material progress to accumulate goodwill for African leaders or at least a short-term political boost. Little wonder then that beneficiary governments have often presented these expensive buildings as their own achievements. “On paper, Chinese projects should benefit the generality of Africans, and in many instances, they do as a matter of fact,” Ebenezer Obadare, senior fellow for Africa Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Al Jazeera. “For instance, ordinary Africans are the direct beneficiaries of infrastructure projects [e.g. railways] embarked upon as part of China’s belt and road initiative.” “The only problem is that the negotiations involved in such projects do not always meet the basic test of transparency, and several projects do not seem to be worth the large sums theoretically expended on them,” he added. “Whether the blame for this can be pinned on the Chinese [alone] is a different question.” The true implications of these gifts remain unknown because details about Chinese investment deals on the continent are usually vague and obscure, said Bhaso Ndzendze, associate professor of politics and international relations at the University of Johannesburg. “The ambiguity means that some packages can simultaneously be interpreted as loans, investment, and aid,” said Ndzendze, who is also a former research director of the university’s Centre for Africa-China Studies. “These are of course different things and mean different implications … we need information systems to enable transparency so that we can be able to conduct a cost-benefit analysis as citizens and actors outside of government.” All of this has led to questions about how these investments benefit Beijing in the long term. In 2018, French daily Le Monde reported that the African Union (AU) headquarters in Addis Ababa had been bugged by the Chinese who had gifted it to the AU five years earlier to listen in on state secrets. The AU and the Chinese government denied the reports, but it is widely believed within and beyond the continent that Beijing is not always straightforward about its dealings. “Countries are always seeking to get one over on their rivals, so AU should have put the proper monitoring mechanism in place when the project was going on to ensure that nothing nefarious happened,” Obadare said. “I don’t distrust Chinese intentions more now that we know it bugged the AU parliament. As a matter of fact, I would have been suspicious if it didn’t, given the opportunity it had to do so.” Others noted that the incident did not cause much of an uproar as it should have, across the continent. “Both Chinese and African officials were eager to portray a “united front” that portrayed the story as a fabrication,” said Ndzendze. “It is also worrying that the story was broken out by a French news source, Le Monde … this would mean essentially that a French entity found Africa to be being spied on by a Chinese entity.” In a number of countries, regular citizens are beginning to criticise China’s presence on the continent. There have been protests about work conditions on these projects over the years in places like Zambia and Malawi, as well as elsewhere on the continent. In June 2022, two months before William Ruto, then deputy president of Kenya, won the presidential elections, he pledged to publish details of government contracts with the Chinese, keying into strong local resentment over the country’s indebtedness to the Asian country. Geopolitical influence Experts believe that the primary reason for China’s initiatives is to, on the one hand, expand its geopolitical influence on the continent especially as it continues its Belt and Road Initiative, while also decreasing the influence of its global competition, namely the United States and Europe. “We should not underestimate the extent to which China’s investment-based diplomacy in Africa can reshape alliances,” said John McCauley, associate professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland. “Paying for buildings and infrastructure may seem like a lazy and transactional means of building friendships at the national level, but it works politically.” “We have seen shifts in the positions of African states on matters such as the Taiwan issue and the South China Sea dispute. Importantly, research indicates that influence of this sort is zero-sum: as China’s influence rises, the influence of the US falls,” he said. Indeed, a number of African states have been remarkably reluctant to criticise China within the framework of the United Nations Human Rights Council. Beyond diplomatic influence, China may also be getting just as much as it has been giving, as its economic interests in Africa have been expanding. Despite the pandemic, trade volumes between China and Africa reached a record $254bn in 2021, according to the Chinese customs agency, four times that between the US and Africa. And Zeng explains why the trend could continue. “To Chinese companies, the competition is relatively less intense in Africa, thus, at the macro, Africa is an important partner for China to exert its influence on global platforms,” he said.",2013-2017,8,high_conflict
89,2015,aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/8/kazakh-president-orders-probe-into-china-linked-transport-project,en,"Kazakh president orders probe into China-linked transport project The country’s new leader appears to be shaking off claims he remain’s the former president’s puppet. Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on Tuesday ordered an investigation into former senior officials who initiated a struggling $1.5-bn Chinese-led project to build a light rail network in the capital. While Tokayev mentioned no names, his order could mean that he is targeting former and current members of his patron and predecessor Nursultan Nazarbayev’s inner circle – challenging the widespread notion that the president is only number two in the Kazakh political hierarchy. Tokayev’s criticism could also hurt the image of Beijing’s Belt and Road infrastructure development initiative, of which the troubled project was part. Kazakhstan signed deals with several Chinese companies and the state-owned China Development Bank in 2015 to finance and carry out a light rail transit (LRT) project in Astana, which has since been renamed Nur-Sultan. The 22-km (14 miles) network was originally due to be built in time to serve visitors to the 2017 Expo exhibition, for which Kazakhstan built a whole new area in the capital. But the project lagged behind schedule and was plagued with financial difficulties such as having a large part of its cash – more than $200 million – frozen in a local bank that went bust. Last spring, construction was put on hold altogether as the city government and the Chinese bank could not agree on the terms of the next loan tranche. At a meeting with city government officials on Tuesday, Tokayev said the project should have never been given a greenlight in the first place. “This is a very questionable project … economically incomprehensible,” he said. “I do not understand how it could have been launched.” Because of large costs and heavy penalties for pulling out of the deal, Kazakhstan will have to complete the project, Tokayev said, but those behind it must be held accountable. “I would also like to ask the anti-corruption agency to step up the investigation, it should not be superficial, simply noting that certain people have fled abroad … and overlooking (the roles) of others,” he said. Tokayev’s comments appeared to refer to Talgat Ardan, a former Astana LRT chief executive who was put on the wanted list in July on embezzlement charges, and some of the former mayors of the capital. The LRT project was launched in 2011 under Mayor Imangali Tasmagambetov but was subsequently shelved due to high costs. The next mayor, Adilbek Zhaksybekov, revived the idea and oversaw the signing of the deals with Chinese companies. His successor Aset Isekeshev, in turn, oversaw the revision of some of the deal terms. All three men are political heavyweights who had for years – alongside Tokayev himself – been promoted by and became close to Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan’s sole leader for nearly 30 years. The offices of Isekeshev, who now manages Nazarbayev’s nonprofit foundation, and Tasmagambetov, who is Kazakhstan’s ambassador to Russia, declined to comment on Tokayev’s speech. Zhaksybekov’s office could not be reached for comment. Nazarbayev resigned last March, handing over the presidency to Tokayev in line with the Constitution and backing him in the subsequent election. But the 78-year-old former Communist apparatchik retains the title of Yelbasy, the national leader, and enjoys sweeping powers as the chair of the security council and head of the ruling Nur Otan party.",2013-2017,6,high_conflict

China is exporting its model of digital authoritarianism abroad with the help of its far-reaching tech industry and massive infrastructure projects, offering a blueprint of “best practices” to neighbours including Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam, a human rights watchdog has warned. In 2015, two years after kicking off its massive Belt and Road initiative, China launched its “Digital Silk Road” project to expand access to digital infrastructure such as submarine cables, satellites, 5G connectivity and more.

The Digital Silk Road “has been just as much about promoting China’s tech industry and developing digital infrastructure as it has about reshaping standards and internet governance norms away from a free, open, and interoperable internet in favour of a fragmented digital ecosystem, built on censorship and surveillance, where China and other networked autocracies can prosper”, the watchdog said in a report released in April. The 80-page report describes how the Chinese state is inextricably linked to its tech industry, a key player in the Digital Silk Road project, as private companies like Huawei, ZTE, and Alibaba serve as “proxies” for the Communist Party. China has signed dozens of technical standard agreements with 49 countries participating in the Belt and Road, while other countries in the region including Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, and Thailand have agreed on further communiques with Beijing on digital infrastructure. The Asia Pacific region is particularly important to Beijing, Article 19 said, as it holds a “strategic significance for China as it rolls out next-generation technologies and seeks global partners in normalising its authoritarian approach to internet governance”. Some countries, like Cambodia, have modelled their digital governance on China, according to Article 2019. Since 2021, the Southeast Asian country has been working to build a “National Internet Gateway” in the style of China’s “Great Firewall” that limits access to many Western media outlets, Wikipedia, and social media sites like Facebook and X. Others have also expressed concern about the project. “The Cambodian government says this will bolster national security and help crack down on tax fraud. But the impact on Cambodian network connections will affect anyone who connects with those networks, which could have serious consequences for social and economic life, as well as potentially endanger free expression,” the Internet Society warned in December. Nepal and Thailand are both reportedly interested in building a similar firewall, according to Article 19, and have played an active role in monitoring ethnic minority Tibetans and Uighurs living abroad on behalf of Beijing. Under President Xi Jinping, the line between the Communist Party and the Chinese state has blurred considerably. The Party has also extended its influence deep into the private sector, with cells established in more than 90 percent of China’s top 500 companies, according to Article 19. These companies, including tech giants, have been drafted into Beijing’s “united front” influence campaign to improve China’s image abroad and expand its global influence, Article 19 said, despite promises that they are independent of the state. Concerns about data, privacy and potential influence campaigns have helped energise a push in the United States to ban TikTok, the wildly popular China-owned video app. Those behind the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act argue the app could allow the Chinese government to access user data and influence Americans. Security concerns have also affected the businesses of companies like Huawei and ZTE not only in the US but in other democracies including Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and the UK. In the US, the two firms have been designated “national security threats” and banned from the construction of critical infrastructure. Beyond China’s borders, the closer ties between the state and tech companies have also raised questions about how issues like data privacy or censorship will be handled abroad by Chinese tech companies, who operate undersea cables that grant them de facto control of huge swaths of global internet traffic. Article 19 said it was “plausible that China would share such data with allied authoritarian governments or exploit it as part of its influence operations over others. Without greater transparency and oversight, it is impossible to rule out these concerns.”",2013-2017,6,high_conflict

Islamabad, Pakistan – As Pakistan sought to defend itself against Indian missiles and drones launched at its military bases and cities in early May, it relied on an unlikely combination of assets: Chinese missiles and air defence; Chinese and United States fighter jets; and US diplomacy. The missiles, air defence and jets helped Pakistan thwart any devastating hits on its airbases and claim it had brought down multiple Indian fighter planes – an assertion that India has neither confirmed nor denied.

The diplomacy sealed a ceasefire that Pakistan has publicly welcomed and thanked the Donald Trump administration for. Yet, as the US has in recent years increasingly picked India over Pakistan as its principal South Asian partner, Pakistan this week worked to reassure China that Beijing remained its most coveted ally. Pakistan’s Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who also serves as foreign minister, visited Beijing earlier this week, meeting his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on May 20 in the first high-profile overseas visit by a Pakistani leader since the ceasefire. According to a statement from the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the two sides discussed the fallout of the brief but intense conflict with India, the ceasefire, and Islamabad’s criticism of New Delhi’s actions. During the meeting with Wang, Dar highlighted India’s “unilateral and illegal decision” to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a six-decade water-sharing agreement. India halted the accord following the April 22 Pahalgam attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which left 26 people dead. Delhi blamed the attack on Pakistan-based armed groups, an allegation Islamabad denies. Wang, meanwhile, welcomed the ceasefire, describing it as serving the “fundamental and long-term interests of both sides [India and Pakistan]” while promoting regional peace. Getting Wang on board was critical for Pakistan, say analysts. ‘Power struggle in South Asia’ With South Asia sitting on a tinderbox during the recent Pakistan-India standoff, a larger geopolitical contest loomed in the background. Pakistan, once a key US ally, has shifted decisively into China’s orbit, relying on its northwestern neighbour heavily for economic and military support. Meanwhile, India, long known for its non-alignment policy, has leaned closer to the US in recent years as part of a strategy to counter China’s rising influence. Shahid Ali, an assistant professor of international relations at Lahore College for Women University, who specialises in Pakistan-China relations, said the timing and optics of Dar’s visit were significant. “While Pakistan hoped to get China’s full diplomatic support for its conflict with India, especially regarding the suspension of the IWT, the visit also provided Dar a good opportunity to apprise China about US-led ceasefire dynamics, also reassuring them of Pakistan’s longstanding all-weather strategic partnership,” Ali told Al Jazeera. Erum Ashraf, a UK-based scholar focused on Pakistan-China ties and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) – a $62bn mega project launched a decade ago – echoed this view. She said the meeting allowed China to better understand what promises Pakistan may have made to the US and President Trump, who helped mediate the ceasefire. “The Chinese must be concerned how Pakistan managed to gain President Trump’s support to talk of ceasefire and to even offer to resolve the matter of Kashmir between both countries. The Chinese worry how US influence in their back yard could impact their interest in the region,” she told Al Jazeera. CPEC remains a cornerstone Pakistan’s former ambassador to China, Masood Khalid, called Beijing a “logical” first stop for Islamabad’s efforts to use diplomacy to push its narrative about the crisis with India in the aftermath of the ceasefire. He noted that beyond the recent India-Pakistan military confrontation, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor remained a key pillar of bilateral cooperation. “The foreign minister may apprise the Chinese side of the security steps which Pakistan has taken for Chinese nationals’ protection,” Khalid told Al Jazeera. Indeed, according to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang prodded both countries to work together to create an “upgraded version of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.” CPEC, launched in 2015 under then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the elder brother of current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, has been hailed as a “game-changer” for Pakistan. It is a key component of China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a huge network of roads, bridges and ports spread across nearly 100 countries that Beijing hopes will recreate the ancient Silk Road trade routes linking Europe and Asia. However, CPEC has faced repeated delays, especially in Balochistan, where its crown jewel, the Gwadar Port, is located. Separatist groups in Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest but poorest province, have long waged an armed rebellion against the state and have repeatedly hit Chinese personnel and installations, accusing them of benefitting from the province’s vast natural resources. According to Pakistani government figures, nearly 20,000 Chinese nationals live in the country. At least 20 have been killed since 2021 in various attacks in different parts of Pakistan. While Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry did not mention it explicitly, the Chinese statement quoted Dar as saying his country would make every effort to “ensure the safety of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan”. Muhammad Faisal, a South Asia security researcher at the University of Technology Sydney, said the safety of Chinese nationals remains Beijing’s “topmost concern”. “Even as the crisis with India heightened, the presence of a large number of Chinese nationals in Pakistan, in some ways, compelled Beijing to seek swift crisis de-escalation,” he told Al Jazeera. ‘China’s high-wire act’ Between April 22, when the Pahalgam attack occurred, and May 7, when India struck targets inside Pakistani territory, a global diplomatic effort was quietly under way to de-escalate tensions between the two nuclear-armed nations. During this period, the US initially showed little interest in direct involvement while China, initially, also was slow to get involved. China, which has a historically tense relationship with Delhi that suffered further after their troops clashed in the Galwan Valley of Ladakh in 2020, eventually urged restraint from both sides. However, many observers felt China’s position was seen as lacking neutrality due to its closeness with Pakistan. Faisal said China is likely to maintain its current “high-wire act”, acknowledging Pakistan’s security concerns while continuing to call for calm on both sides. He added that while the US was the lead mediator for the ceasefire, Beijing double-tapped Washington by calling both Islamabad and New Delhi to dial down tensions. “A lesson Beijing learned is that its current restrained public posturing opened up diplomatic space to engage with interlocutors in both Islamabad and New Delhi, despite the fact that the latter views its role with scepticism,” he said. Ashraf, the UK-based academic, said India did not view China as a “neutral umpire” in its disputes with Pakistan – even though New Delhi and Beijing have in recent months tried to reset their ties, pulling troops back from contested border points and ramping up diplomatic efforts to calm tensions. “India and China have only recently achieved a breakthrough in their strained border relations, which perhaps helps to explain China’s initial ‘hands off’ behaviour with Pakistan after Pahalgam,” she said. But ultimately, she said, China needs to “balance a tightrope”: It doesn’t want to “upset relations with India”, but it also needs to help Pakistan enough that it doesn’t “collapse in the face of India’s attacks”. That’s a balance China managed to strike successfully in early May. With Dar’s visit to Beijing, say analysts, Pakistan – which also benefitted from US diplomatic intervention – tried to repay the favour.",2013-2017,12,high_conflict

The Astana summit follows the inaugural May 2023 China–Central Asia Summit, which was held in Xi’an, the capital city of China’s Shaanxi province. Xi is expected to be in Astana from June 16 to 18 and is scheduled to hold bilateral meetings with Kazakhstan’s leaders on Monday before the summit on June 17. At the summit, he is expected to deliver a keynote speech and “exchange views on the achievements of the China-Central Asia mechanism, mutually beneficial cooperation under the framework, and international and regional hotspot issues,” said a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson. The office of Kazakhstan’s president noted that both countries are “set to further strengthen bilateral ties” and Xi will also chair “high-level talks with President [Tokayev] focused on deepening the comprehensive strategic partnership”. Tokayev, who has been in office since 2019, is a fluent Mandarin speaker and previously served as a diplomat in China. Zhao Long, a senior research fellow at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (SIIS), told Al Jazeera that Central Asian countries see their partnership with China as a deep, multifaceted cooperation grounded in shared strategic and pragmatic interests. “The alignment with China helps Central Asian states enhance their regional stability, pursue economic modernisation, and diversify their diplomatic portfolios,” said Zhao. Where Central Asia has abundant energy resources, he said, China offers vast markets, advanced technology, and infrastructure expertise. Last Friday, Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, told a news briefing that establishing “the China-Central Asia mechanism was a unanimous decision among China and the five Central Asian countries, which dovetails with the region’s common desire to maintain stability and pursue high-quality development”. Since China first formalised and chaired the China-Central Asia Summit in May 2023, Lin said, “China’s relations with Central Asian countries have entered a new era … injecting fresh impetus into regional development and delivering tangibly for the peoples of all six countries.” “We believe through this summit, China and five Central Asian countries will further consolidate the foundation of mutual trust,” Lin added. “During the summit, President Xi will also meet with these leaders and lay out the top-level plan for China’s relations with [the] five Central Asian countries,” said the spokesperson. SIIS’s Zhao said Xi’s attendance at the second summit sends a clear message: “China places high strategic importance on Central Asia.” What’s ‘C5+1’ – and is China racing the US for influence? Experts are dubbing the China-Central Asia Summit as a C5+1 framework, because of the five regional nations involved. The United States first initiated the concept of such a summit with all five Central Asian nations in 2015, under then-US President Barack Obama. But at the time, the conclave was held at the level of foreign ministers. Then-US Secretary of State John Kerry led the first meeting in September 2015 on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. In January 2022, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a virtual summit with the five Central Asian state heads, and then in June 2025, he invited them for a follow-up conclave in India. Meanwhile, in 2023, Xi hosted the leaders in Xi’an. Four months later, then-US President Joe Biden hosted the C5 state heads on the sidelines of the UNGA in New York. It was the first time a US president met with Central Asian heads of state under this framework. But current US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies could upset that outreach from Washington. Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan have all been tariffed at 10 percent. Trump initially imposed an even higher 27 percent tariff on imports from Kazakhstan, the region’s largest economy, though as with all other countries, the US president has paused these rates, limiting tariffs to a flat 10 percent for now. China has cited these tariff rates to project itself as a more reliable partner to Central Asia than the US. At the meeting with the foreign ministers of the region in April, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi criticised unilateralism, trade protectionism, and “the trend of anti-globalisation [that] has severely impacted the free trade system”. The US, Wang said, was “undermining the rule-based multilateral trading system, and destabilising the global economy”. Why does Central Asia matter to China? The region, rich in uranium, oil, and rare earth metals, has become increasingly important to China as a key corridor for trade with Europe. Subsequently, China has increased its engagement with Central Asian countries. Xi, who has curtailed his foreign visits since the COVID-19 pandemic, is visiting Kazakhstan for the third time since 2020. He visited in 2022, and then again in 2024. Central Asia is also a critical part of Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) — a network of highways, railroads and ports connecting Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America — as a gateway to Europe. Experts expect the BRI to figure prominently at the summit in Astana on Tuesday, with additional emphasis on collaboration in energy and sustainable development. A planned $8bn railway connecting China’s Xinjiang region to Uzbekistan through Kyrgyzstan is likely to be on the agenda, the SIIS’s Zhao said. Construction on the project is scheduled to begin in July. Expected to be completed by 2030, the railway route will provide China with more direct access to Central Asia and reduce the three countries’ reliance on Russia’s transport infrastructure. Additionally, Zhao said, the summit may feature agreements on reducing tariffs, streamlining customs procedures, and lowering non-tariff barriers to boost bilateral trade volumes. How much does Central Asia depend on China? A lot. China is today the top trading partner of each of the five Central Asian republics. - Kazakhstan imported goods worth $18.7bn from China and exported goods worth $15bn in 2023 — making up 30 percent of its total imports and 16 percent of exports. - Tajikistan imported goods worth $3.68bn from China and exported goods worth $250m in 2023 — making up 56 percent of its total imports and 16 percent of exports. - Kyrgyzstan imported goods worth $3.68bn and exported goods worth $887m in 2023 from China — constituting 29 percent of its total imports and 26 percent of exports. - Uzbekistan imported goods worth $12.7bn and exported goods worth $1.82bn in 2023 from the world’s second-largest economy — representing 32 percent of its total imports and 6 percent of exports. - Turkmenistan imported goods worth $957m and exported goods worth $9.63bn in 2023 from China — or 20 percent of its total imports and 62 percent of exports. China is also ramping up its investments in the region. It has committed to an estimated $26bn in investments in Kazakhstan, for instance. Is China replacing Russia in Central Asia? It’s complicated. Formerly parts of the Soviet Union, the five Central Asian republics have long belonged in Russia’s strategic sphere of influence. Millions of people from the five republics live and work in Russia, and since 2023, Moscow has become a supplier of natural gas to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, which have faced energy shortages — even though Central Asia was historically a supplier of energy to Russia. But though Russia remains a major economic force in the region, China has overtaken it as the largest trading partner of Central Asian republics over the past three years — a period that has coincided with Russia’s war on Ukraine. Some of that increased trade, in fact, is believed to be the outcome of China using Central Asia as a conduit for exports to Russia of goods that face Western sanctions. Still, there are ways in which Russia remains the region’s preeminent outside ally. Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan — three of the region’s five nations — are part of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) — along with Russia, Armenia and Belarus. Like NATO, this bloc offers collective security guarantees to members. In effect, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have the cover of Russia’s protection if they are attacked by another nation — something that China does not offer.",2013-2017,10,high_conflict

As China pushes to expand the CPEC, Pakistan-Afghanistan tensions continue to cast a shadow over trilateral diplomacy. Islamabad, Pakistan – With clasped hands and half-smiles, the foreign ministers of Pakistan, China and Afghanistan’s ruling Taliban posed as they gathered in Kabul on Wednesday for a trilateral meeting. It was the second such meeting between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Pakistan’s Ishaq Dar and their Afghan counterpart Amir Khan Muttaqi in 12 weeks, after they huddled together in Beijing in May. Recommended Stories list of 4 items- list 1 of 4After a year of hostility, Pakistan and Afghanistan seek diplomatic reboot - list 2 of 4Pakistan, Afghanistan move towards ‘restoring ties’ in talks with China - list 3 of 4Afghanistan welcomes upgraded diplomatic ties with neighbouring Pakistan - list 4 of 4China FM in Afghanistan, offers to deepen cooperation with Taliban rulers That May meeting had led to the resumption of diplomatic ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan after a period of high tension between them. It also set the stage for talks on extending the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) – a part of China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) – into Afghanistan. The BRI is a network of ports, railroads and highways aimed at connecting Asia, Africa and Europe. But as China plans to expand its footprint in the region, its attempts to forge peace between Pakistan and Afghanistan reflect its unease over the security of its interests even along the existing CPEC, say analysts. And while Beijing is a vital partner to both Islamabad and Kabul, experts believe its influence over both remains untested, as does China’s willingness to take on the risks that it might confront if it seeks to bring Pakistan and the Taliban, once thick allies but now embittered neighbours, back into a trusted embrace, they say. Shifting regional dynamics The Beijing conclave took place under the shadow of a four-day conflict between Pakistan and India, but much has changed since then on the regional chessboard. In recent months, Pakistan – long seen as China’s closest ally and reliant on its northeastern neighbour for military and economic support – has strengthened ties with the United States, Beijing’s main global rival. China, for its part, has resumed engagement with India, Pakistan’s arch adversary and its key competitor for regional influence. India has also continued to deepen ties with the Afghan Taliban, who have ruled Afghanistan since August 2021, following the withdrawal of US forces. Pakistan and Afghanistan, meanwhile, remain at odds. Islamabad was once the Taliban’s chief patron. Now, it accuses the group of providing a safe haven to groups carrying out cross-border violence, while Afghanistan accuses Pakistan of human rights violations by expelling Afghan refugees. Amid this, China has positioned itself as mediator, a role driven largely by the CPEC, the $62bn infrastructure project running from the Pakistan-China border in the north to Gwadar Port in Balochistan. A senior Pakistani diplomat with direct knowledge of the recent Pakistani interactions with their Chinese and Afghan counterparts said China, as a common neighbour, places a premium on neighbourhood diplomacy. For China, he added, a peaceful neighbourhood is essential. “China has attached high importance to stability and security to pursue and expand its larger BRI project, so expansion of westward connectivity and development can only succeed when, among others, these two countries are stabilised,” the official told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity. “Development and connectivity cannot be achieved in the absence of security. Hence its efforts to bring the two neighbours together,” he added. CPEC under strain CPEC, launched in 2015 under then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, elder brother of current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, has been hailed by many in Pakistan as a “game-changer” for the country – a giant investment with the potential to create jobs and build the economy. But the project has slowed down in recent years. Later this month, Prime Minister Sharif is expected to travel to China to formally launch the second phase of the CPEC. While political upheaval has hampered progress, China’s primary concerns remain the safety of infrastructure and the security of its nationals, who have frequently been targeted. Separatist groups in Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest but poorest province, have long attacked Chinese personnel and installations, accusing them of exploiting local resources. Attacks on Chinese citizens have also occurred in Pakistan’s north. Nearly 20,000 Chinese nationals currently live in Pakistan, according to government figures. Since 2021, at least 20 have been killed in attacks across the country. Stella Hong Zhang, assistant professor at Indiana University Bloomington in the US, said China has long wanted to bring Afghanistan into the CPEC, to expand the project’s scope and to promote regional integration. But Zhang, whose research focuses on China’s global development engagement, said it is unclear how convinced Beijing is about investing in either Afghanistan or Pakistan. “China might promise investments, but even though we are seeing actions on China’s diplomacy front,” she told Al Jazeera, it is uncertain whether officials in the two nations “will be able to convince China’s state-owned enterprises and banks to invest in further projects in both countries, given CPEC’s disappointing track record and the substantial risks in both countries”. For Muhammad Faisal, a South Asia security researcher at the University of Technology Sydney, improvement in Pakistan’s internal security is paramount for China. “This concern is what guides Beijing’s push for improvement in Pak-Afghan bilateral ties since the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) is operating from the Afghan soil, while Baloch militant groups have also found space in Afghanistan,” he told Al Jazeera. “Through high-level trilateral talks, Beijing is aiming to narrow Islamabad-Kabul differences and also urge both sides to address each other’s security concerns to avert a breakdown of ties,” he added. Pakistan Taliban, also known as TTP, founded in 2007, is a group which is ideologically aligned with the Taliban in Afghanistan but operates independently both in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban has repeatedly rejected allegations that it allows its soil to be used for attacks against Pakistan and has consistently denied any ties with the TTP. Security challenges Since the Taliban seized power in August 2021, Pakistan has faced a sharp rise in violence, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, both bordering Afghanistan. Islamabad has repeatedly alleged that Afghan soil is being used by armed groups, especially the TTP, to launch attacks across the porous frontier. Data from the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) shows that in the first six months of 2025, 502 fighter attacks killed 737 people, including 284 security personnel and 267 civilians. Compared with the first half of 2024, fighter attacks rose 5 percent, deaths surged 121 percent, and injuries increased 84 percent, according to PICSS. China, too, has also voiced concern over the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), accusing its fighters of using Afghan territory to launch attacks against China. Abdul Basit, a research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said that since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, China has emerged as South Asia’s main geopolitical player. “Without addressing Pakistan’s Afghan-centric security concerns, BRI’s Pakistan component, CPEC, will remain underutilised and underdeveloped. Hence, China has started the trilateral to help Afghanistan and Pakistan resolve their security issues under a holistic policy which tries to isolate economy and diplomacy from security trouble,” he told Al Jazeera. Faisal, of the University of Technology Sydney, added that China brings political weight, offering both diplomatic backing at multilateral organisations – particularly on counterterrorism – and the promise of economic inducements. But he was cautious about Beijing’s long-term leverage. “Beyond underlining the importance of stability via enhanced security coordination between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the outcomes of China’s efforts have been limited, partially due to Beijing’s own security anxieties,” he said. The senior Pakistani diplomat said China’s BRI and related projects have brought it leverage in Southeast Asia and Central Asia, and expressed optimism that Beijing could bring about change between Pakistan and Afghanistan “armed with the political, diplomatic, economic and financial tools”, even if results have so far been limited. But will China act as mediator and guarantor between Pakistan and Afghanistan? The diplomat was sceptical. “As for guarantorship, I’m not sure whether China is willing or keen to do so. It certainly can play that role because of a high degree of trust it enjoys, but whether it would do so or not remains to be seen,” he said.",2013-2017,18,high_conflict
94,2015,aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2018/2/16/maldives-in-crisis-beijing-faces-tough-choices,en,"Maldives in crisis: Beijing faces tough choices The recent constitutional crisis in the Maldives put the cozy relationship between the archipelago and China to test. On a cold December day in 2017, China’s President Xi Jinping welcomed a special guest at the Great Hall of the People: Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom. The President of the Maldives walked along the red carpet with the swagger of a leader in complete control. A week earlier, his government had engineered parliamentary approval of a landmark Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with China, sidelining the opposition. The final deal was to be inked during this visit. Indeed this was a tipping point in the not-so-gradual shift towards China that had been under way in Maldivian foreign policy over the past few years. During the visit President Xi emphatically described Yameen as “a member of the neighbouring extended family of China.” But only two short months later, the bonds between the two nations are unexpectedly put to test. A constitutional crisis On February 5, 2018, Yameen declared a 15-day emergency following a Supreme Court order quashing terrorism charges against nine leading opposition figures, including former president Mohamed Nasheed. In a matter of hours, security forces swept across Male, detaining two Supreme Court judges. Other opposition figures, including the country’s longest-serving leader Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, were also arrested. The Maldives was set for elections later this year, but now the country is in the midst of a constitutional crisis. The ripple effects of these events are also being felt across the Indian Ocean, given the ongoing strategic tussle for influence between China and India, which views the region as its traditional sphere of influence. In that context, Yameen’s decision poses an intriguing strategic challenge for Beijing. Understanding this requires a brief examination of China’s aims, interests and actions in the region. Speaking at the 19th National Party Congress in October last year, Xi had outlined China’s short and long-term goals: to emerge as a leading power in Asia before growing to assume global leadership status by 2050. Beijing seeks to accomplish this by expanding what it calls its comprehensive national power, leveraging its growing economic strength to deepen strategic engagement with developing countries and increasingly playing an active role in issues of global governance while defining new norms. It is an ambitious agenda, which requires deft diplomacy in terms of actions and messaging in order to mitigate potential counter-balancing by smaller states and opposition of rival powers. An increasingly cozy relationship Applying that model to the Sino-Maldives relationship reveals certain key underlying dynamics. For starters, despite having established formal bilateral ties in 1972, the relationship between the two countries only began to deepen after China opened its first full diplomatic mission in Male in 2011. Since then, it has expanded exponentially, with Xi becoming the first Chinese head of state to visit the Maldives in 2014. China has already pledged hundreds of millions of dollars in grants. It accounts for nearly one-fourth of all tourists visiting the country. Chinese companies are executing mega infrastructure projects across the archipelago, which is a Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) partner nation. A 2015 amendment to the Maldivian constitution permitting foreign ownership of land was largely seen as a China-focussed move, which was then followed by the 2017 FTA. For the Maldives, clearly China has become a crucial economic parter. But given the size of Beijing’s coffers and its investments in other parts of the world, in pure financial terms, the investments in the Maldives are insignificant. A recent Moody’s analysis estimates the Maldives’ total foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2017 at roughly $485m. Economics, therefore, is not Beijing’s driving motivation. Rather, it is a strategic objective that Xi is pursuing. Building a blue-water navy that is capable of protecting crucial trade routes, ensuring energy supplies and securing overseas Chinese assets is a stated goal of the PLA’s modernisation programme. The Maldives’ geographic position, therefore, is key, given that at least one-third of the world’s bulk cargo traffic and even greater volumes of oil shipments pass through the Indian Ocean. The first explicit evidence of this agenda was witnessed when three Chinese naval frigates docked in Male in August 2017 for a “friendly” visit. China between two extreme choices This increasingly cozy relationship, however, has been rudely interrupted by the emergency. From Beijing’s perspective, Yameen has left it with two extreme choices – stand by an ally who’s unpopularity at home could stick to you or tilt towards democracy. There is, of course, room for manoeuvre between these two ends of the spectrum, but none of those choices are easy to execute and each will come with their own costs. For instance, unyielding support by Beijing coupled with an extension of the emergency in the Maldives and further suppression of opposition could force other international actors to intervene. Such intervention can range from imposing political and economic sanctions on the regime to even covert and overt force options. In addition, it could further underscore the logic of engagement under the Indo-Pacific rubric and override sceptical domestic constituencies in each of these states. The Chinese are also likely to be closely assessing how events in the Maldives are being perceived by its allies and BRI nations. Not standing by a trusted partner could imply adverse signalling for leaders like Nicolas Maduro or Rodrigo Duterte. On the other hand, backing Yameen unconditionally could vitiate political and public perception of China in BRI nations. Moreover, it would further intensify the systemic values competition between China and the West for shaping global norms. These constraints already appear to be at play in China’s actions so far. For instance, Beijing has described, as expected, the emergency as an internal matter and provided cover for Yameen at the UN. But it has also acknowledged India’s influence, saying it is in India and China’s “common interest” to maintain stability in the Maldives. Beijing also hinted that it will keep its forces away by reposing faith in the Maldivian forces to protect Chinese investments and Foreign Minister Wang Yi has been particular in stressing the “unconditional” nature of China’s aid and assistance to the country. It is evident that there’s a delicate balancing act that Beijing must and is attempting to perform. In the long run, it desires a supportive regime in Male. For that, it must keep Yameen in check, cooperate with regional and global powers and avoid alienating the Maldivian people.

95,2015,aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2020/7/29/nepal-is-walking-a-tightrope-between-india-and-china,en,"Nepal is walking a tightrope between India and China India-China tensions are complicating a simmering political crisis in Kathmandu. This year, amid a raging pandemic, a looming global economic crisis and devastating floods and landslides, the Himalayan nation of Nepal has been in political and diplomatic turmoil over its disputed border with its much larger neighbour, India. The dispute has deepened strains within the current government and reignited debate over the future of Nepal’s relations with India and China. On May 8, India inaugurated a link road built in a disputed territory which falls near a strategic three-way junction with Nepal and China. Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who was already facing multiple domestic political challenges, adopted a defiant stance against New Delhi and deemed the new road an attack on Nepal’s sovereignty. He issued a new map which places the disputed region within Nepal’s borders and swiftly passed it through both houses of the parliament. His ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) also pushed an amendment to the country’s citizenship law that requires foreign women marrying Nepali men (most of whom are Indian) to wait for seven years for naturalisation. Oli’s nationalist stance earned him some much-needed support among the Nepalese public, but proved insufficient to silence his many critics who have long been demanding his resignation citing his failure to provide effective leadership at a time of crisis. Commentators and officials both in India and Nepal accused him of cynically using the border dispute to stir nationalist sentiment and outmanoeuvre his rivals in the NCP, or acting at China’s behest. In response, Oli has claimed that his political rivals within the ruling party are “colluding with India to oust him from power”. His chief opponent in the NCP, former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal – commonly known as “Prachanda” – described the accusation as “neither politically correct nor diplomatically appropriate,” asserting that it was he, not India, who sought Oli’s resignation. Rivalries within the NCP undoubtedly played a role in aggravating Nepal’s political crisis. Nevertheless, it is also impossible to deny the significant role Nepal’s two giant neighbours, India and China, have played in bringing about the turmoil. All politics is local In May, the Indian Army chief General MM Naravane went out of his way to suggest that Oli’s objection to India’s road construction was instigated by Beijing. Indian news outlets, particularly those close to the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), relentlessly attacked Oli for his alleged pro-China and anti-India stance. One Indian channel directly warned Oli not to challenge India, a country on which “you depend so heavily”. The Indian media has obsessively reported on the activities of the Chinese Ambassador to Nepal, Hou Yanqi, even levelling tasteless allegations that the “model-like” envoy has “honey-trapped” Oli. She has indeed been active throughout the crisis, holding numerous meetings with senior Nepali political leaders. And China does appear to be standing by Oli in this dispute, but there is no evidence that Beijing is goading him into taking on New Delhi. India too is by no means a mere bystander. Top Indian intelligence officials, according to a report in the Daily Pioneer, have been actively courting senior Nepali politicians. The Indian media’s relentless onslaught on Oli also gives weight to the 68-year-old leader’s accusations that India is actively working to topple his government. And so too does the recent past. India has brought down several governments in Kathmandu over the years. Observers generally see Oli as supported by Beijing and Prachanda by New Delhi. There is, however, little publicly available evidence to support the claim that New Delhi is propping up Prachanda to replace Oli. Prachanda has his own reasons for sparring with Oli. In 2018, the leftist parties of Oli and Prachanda merged. The two men have shared the post of chairman of the newly-formed NCP and reportedly agreed to alternate as prime minister over the course of the NCP’s five-year term in power, which is now at its halfway point. Last November, Prachanda reportedly accepted a revised deal that would give him control over the party while allowing Oli to continue as prime minister. Oli appears not to have held up his end of the bargain, hence Prachanda’s anger. Even if Prachanda is indeed backed by New Delhi, the partnership is likely tactical and temporary. Prachanda has had a complicated relationship with India. India facilitated the integration of Nepal’s Maoist rebels – led by Prachanda – into the political fold in the mid-2000s, but also helped force Prachanda’s resignation as prime minister in 2009 after he took on the Nepal Army, a key lever of Indian influence. Notably, Prachanda has not played the anti-Beijing card to gain the upper hand against Oli. In fact, he has also taken positions as of late that can be seen as pro-Beijing. While Oli supported the United States Millennium Challenge Corporation’s (MCC) Nepal compact – which Washington says aims to increase the availability of electricity and lower the cost of transportation in the country – Prachanda opposed it, citing US statements linking the project to the Indo-Pacific Strategy, which is largely seen as a China containment policy. Prachanda made a veiled reference to the MCC project in an address to the Chinese Communist Party last month, stating that any developmental assistance inconsistent with the country’s policy of non-alignment “can’t be accepted by any means.” Indian heavy-handedness created opening for China If Oli is forced to resign, it would not necessarily be an enduring setback for Beijing. As Nepali news editor Biswas Baral argues, the cohesion of the NCP is more important for Beijing than Oli’s survival. Furthermore, the NCP leadership is likely to sustain its desire for China to play a balancing role even after Oli’s departure, due to its deep-rooted fear of Indian dominance. Over the decades, India has played a paternalistic role in Nepal, which has been helpful in many ways. However, New Delhi has also been heavy-handed and abusive in its dealings with its Himalayan neighbour, leveraging the landlocked country’s dependence on it for access to the sea. India is Nepal’s largest trade partner, accounting for 65 percent of its imports and 57 percent of its exports in 2017. India has used connectivity as a coercive tool, blockading Nepal three times in the past 30 years – most recently in 2015 after a devastating earthquake. The blockade imposed by India on Nepal in 1989 was partly out of concerns over Nepal’s growing proximity to China. While China’s military sales to Nepal grew, India remained the predominant external power in the country. India’s most recent blockade of Nepal has proved to be a strategic folly, stirring Nepali nationalism, which has had an anti-India strain. The blockade roughly coincided with China’s launch of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), giving Beijing an opportunity to step in and pledge large sums of aid and investment. China’s massive investments in extending its domestic rail network toward its western and southwestern frontier amplify its efforts to reshape the region’s economic geography. Its drive to expand connectivity in the region, for example, provided Nepal with an alternative route to the sea. In 2016, China and Nepal concluded a transport agreement that gives Kathmandu access to four Chinese eastern seaports. While India’s Calcutta port is closest to Nepal by distance, Chinese rail service to Tibet, which borders Nepal, provides it with maritime access that may be shorter in time and more competitive in cost than Calcutta. In 2017, Nepal officially joined the Belt and Road Initiative, making clear to India, a lead opponent of the BRI, that it is now a country with options. More money, more problems There is, of course, a price to siding with China. Beijing is notorious for its unfair trade practices. And its economic partnerships with developing countries are often based on loans rather than grants. Many high-risk recipients of Chinese lending struggle to repay their debt to Beijing – a trend that has triggered accusations of “debt-trap diplomacy”. Following their transport agreement, Beijing and Kathmandu are also in talks for building a trans-Himalayan railway linking Nepal to China’s domestic transport network, but the estimated $2.5bn cost of the project may eventually prove too expensive for Nepal. Should the project move forward on a loan basis, Kathmandu may struggle to generate the revenue-generating capacity to repay it, and the country could end up trading Indian dominance for Chinese. Allying with Beijing also requires ritualistic professions of agreement on its “core interests” and policing of Chinese national migrants and refugees, such as Uighurs and Tibetans. Notably, Nepal recently backed China’s new national security law for Hong Kong. Neither China nor India are benign, altruistic powers. Nepali leaders appear to be aware of that. Even if Prachanda comes to power with some help and support from New Delhi, he is unlikely to push away Beijing’s hand. Whoever leads Nepal in the years to come will have to manage a geopolitical environment that is only growing in complexity. Today, Nepal is area of contestation not just between China and India, but also in the broader U.S.-China Cold War. At first glance, Prachanda’s opposition to the USS MCC’s Nepal compact appears to make little sense. Washington is offering a $500m grant, not a loan, to Kathmandu to support the construction of a high-voltage electric power line and upgraded roads. But some Nepali observers fear that the power line project, which will link to India’s electric power grid, may increase Kathmandu’s dependence on New Delhi and harm its burgeoning trade partnerships with Beijing. Nepal is between a rock and a hard place. It undoubtedly wants US support, but equally fears increasing Indian dominance and hence wants to keep China on its side for balance. To receive much needed aid and protection, it somehow needs to simultaneously satisfy these regional and global superpowers, who are all capable and willing to manipulate Kathmandu’s internal divisions and weaknesses for their own benefit. Such a difficult balancing act requires more than will. It requires political stability at home and consensus among domestic power brokers – all of which, unfortunately, have proven to be elusive in Nepal.

96,2015,aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2020/9/8/what-is-behind-the-hype-about-the-new-iran-china-partnership,en,"What is behind the hype about the new Iran-China partnership? By exaggerating the scope and ambitions of the prospective deal, the US media is once again fanning the flames of war. The mainstream US media and think-tanks based along the Washington, DC, beltway have been gripped by two recent momentous developments in the Middle East, both interpreted as escalations in the geopolitical conflict between the US and Iran: the news of a prospective strategic partnership agreement between Iran and China, and the normalisation of relations between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Israel. In fact, the first development was a media creation. The New York Times (NYT) ran a front-page story citing a “leaked” draft of the 25-year strategic partnership agreement under negotiation between China and Iran since 2016. It was provocatively headlined: Defying US, China and Iran near trade and military partnership. “The investment and security pact would vastly extend China’s influence in the Middle East, throwing Iran an economic lifeline and creating new flashpoints with the United States,” read the accompanying blurb. There was no mention of a military partnership in the reported draft agreement, however, and speculation that Iran could lease strategic Gulf islands to China was spread by former-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and members of Iran’s parliament suspicious of Beijing’s intentions. Nonetheless, the NYT headline set the breathless tone for the US media’s coverage of the August 13 establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and the UAE. It was not long before the US media was discussing how the UAE-Israel agreement represented the formation of a US-led grand alliance against a new “axis of evil” between Iran, China and possibly also Turkey. This echoed earlier US media scoops about confidential negotiations between Israeli and Emirati leaders. Gripping, is it not? Well, it is also a disservice to the media’s audiences. There is no grand alliance or “evil axis” – just tentative diplomacy and proxy warfare amid shifts in the balance of power in the Middle East, necessitated in part by the withdrawal of US combat forces from the region, as well as the seepage of power to Beijing from Washington. This information is not hard to come by. A little digging quickly uncovers the large, eloquent body of research and analysis that is maintained and constantly updated by very capable academics. These genuine experts are easy to find on Twitter, where they share each other’s work and chat about the latest news. Unsurprisingly, they have not been impressed with the mainstream media’s melodramatic coverage of US-China competition in the Middle East. Guy Burton, author of the recently published book, China and Middle East Conflicts, took exception to a story published by The Hill, headlined: A China-Iran partnership would make China the Middle East arbiter. “Articles like this overplay China’s investment and influence in Iran (and Israel),” Burton tweeted. “How much of this is intentional (to influence US policy) or because of a misunderstanding of Chinese interest and capacity?” he asked. Ironically, his question was answered by the State Department’s own media arm, Voice of America (VoA), in a nicely balanced article pegged to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s recent bombast on the subject. In an August 2 interview with Fox News, Pompeo claimed that the prospective China-Iran deal would put Communist cash in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’s hands. “China’s entry into Iran will destabilise the Middle East. It’ll put Israel at risk. It’ll put the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Emirates at risk as well,” Pompeo said. The VoA report quoted two Washington-based think-tank hawks supportive of Pompeo’s rhetoric. Then – braving the Trump administration’s campaign to turn the VoA into a partisan parrot – the report cited interviews with three acknowledged experts on the region who debunked Pompeo’s rhetoric. I suspect the VOA Farsi service journalists who conducted those interviews had come across articles written by these specialists, all deploring the twisted portrayal of the media. Writing for the aptly-named website Responsible Statecraft, Jacopo Scita, a doctoral fellow at Durham University, said: “The news of a 25-year comprehensive cooperation agreement secretly signed between the Iranian government and China has been the hot topic of the last few weeks, generating a considerable amount of speculation, exaggeration, and politically biased interpretation. “In reality, the accord does not seem to have the potential to revolutionise the path of China-Iran relations, which has been quite consistent since 1979,” he said. Scita and his fellow academics have explained in great detail where the misleading hype originated from, why China has no motivation whatsoever to take sides in the Middle East’s conflicts, and why Pompeo’s alarmist rhetoric is driven by the prospect that he and his boss might soon lose their jobs. Karen Young, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, summed up the Trump administration’s failures in an article for Al-Monitor entitled: The false logic of a China-US choice in the Middle East. She said countering China in the Middle East “has proven challenging due to inconsistencies within US policy and with the growing perception of China’s attractiveness to the region.” Framing the discussion of China’s rise or role in the Middle East to a zero-sum game of choosing either US or Chinese patronage and partnership has served rhetorically only to increase China’s stature among the region’s political leadership, she said. And relatedly, Young said, the US security strategy that explicitly mentions the importance of allies and shared values has failed to rely on those strengths in counterarguments to the Chinese “choice.” Burton explained that the real target of Washington is Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). While the Trump administration was busy setting the Middle East alight by withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, the Chinese were building ports and industrial zones around the region. Primarily a means of projecting soft power, the BRI may eventually become a cause of conflict in the Middle East because it may result in greater competition by countries to attract Chinese interest and investment, Burton said. “The outcome may be that China ceases to be an outside observer of conflict and becomes an active – albeit reluctant – participant,” he said. In other words, China risks being sucked into other nations’ rivalries, but it will not be the one to pick a fight. At the risk of spotlighting my own inadequacies as a journalist, I can not help wondering why editors and writers seem so willing to fan the flames of war. They have evoked painful memories of how the US media – with the Pulitzer Prize-winning exception of Knight Ridder – unquestioningly propagated the entirely false “weapons of mass destruction” justification for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The long-suffering peoples of the Middle East could do without journalists once again playing cheerleader for American politicians who perpetuate their domestic power by igniting conflict in others’ backyards.

97,2015,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/asias-infrastructure-contest-quantity-vs-quality,en,"Asia’s Infrastructure Contest: Quantity vs. Quality This week in Washington is for global economy wonks what fashion week in Paris is for the best dressed. With roundtables instead of runways, the World Bank’s annual spring meetings and the events around them shape and reflect trends, some longer standing than others. As in years past, there will be calls for equitable growth, inclusive growth, sustainable growth, and responsible growth. Simple growth, simply put, is not in style. Calls for conditioning growth are not new. Widely used quantitative indicators, like gross domestic product (GDP), have always been shallow snapshots, ignoring environmental impacts, inequality, and other priorities. As Robert F. Kennedy said about gross national product (GNP) 50 years ago last month: “It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials…it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.” But for all the talk about quality, quantitative targets have long dominated policymaking. Several years before Robert Kennedy pointed out the shortcomings of GNP, it was his brother, President John F. Kennedy, who set the first U.S. GDP growth targets. A rebuttal to Nikita Khrushchev’s claims about the Soviet economy, JFK’s move was driven not only by economics but also geopolitics. As David Pilling argues in a recent book, The Growth Delusion, the obsession with GDP continues to drive, and often warp, policymaking around the world. The tug of war between quantity and quality is now at the center of Asia’s infrastructure contest. China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has a largely quantitative pull. Estimates range widely, but all point to a massive endeavor, promising some $1 trillion for infrastructure and aiming to connect a growing list of some 70 countries. The world needs trillions of dollars more in infrastructure investment, as estimates from the Asian Development Bank and others make clear. If done right, the BRI could help address those needs. But right is always easier said than done. Like GDP, the BRI’s aspirational investment levels tell us little, if anything, about the actual impact of new infrastructure projects. Will that spending help people who need it most? Will it go into viable projects or white elephants? Will it help or hurt climate change? Will it create or destroy value? As IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said last week, the “challenge is ensuring that Belt and Road only travels where it is needed.” Ignoring quality can be costly, as the United States’ race to build transcontinental railways 150 years ago shows. Speed was prized over safety, ease of access prioritized over protecting the environment, and financing was opaque. Workers were mistreated, and the railways catered to elite interests, despite drawing heavily on public resources. Ultimately, these missteps helped spark two financial crises. A greater emphasis on qualitative concerns could help China avoid making similar mistakes. Seizing on those concerns, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan launched the “Partnership for Quality Infrastructure” in 2015. Backed by $200 billion, it aims to persuade countries to pay more up-front for projects that cost less over their lifetime. During Japan’s host year in 2016, the G7 issued a set of principles for “quality infrastructure.” Safety, sustainability, and reliability are among the goals mentioned. Word for word, many of the same conditions attached to growth are being attached to infrastructure. But Japan and other supporters of “quality” infrastructure face two central challenges. First, they need to broaden support for these goals. Particularly among developing economies, there is a risk that “quality” is conflated with luxury, viewed as nice-to-have rather than essential. Layering on too many requirements will make quality impractical or even unachievable. Nor should “quality” become a euphemism for “not Chinese,” which could set back efforts to raise standards. Looking ahead, Argentina and Japan’s G20 host years are important opportunities to a build a larger coalition for “quality” infrastructure. The second challenge is operationalizing these principles. For all the talk about “quality,” experts differ about what these aspirations should mean in practice. The term “sustainable,” for example, is commonly used to cover everything from environmental issues to financing and maintenance. This is a balancing act, of course. The more detail that is provided, the more difficult it is to sustain a broader consensus. But without greater specificity, principles can be dismissed as platitudes or espoused but not implemented. One promising avenue to encourage greater follow-through is to develop criteria for measuring and monitoring quality. Providing objective measures could help clarify what quality means in practice. Those measures could also provide a basis for comparing how different approaches perform, helping to highlight best practices, and assist officials making project decisions. In other words, quality could use some quantification. Jonathan Hillman is director of the Reconnecting Asia Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.

98,2015,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/bailing-out-chinas-belt-and-road,en,"Bailing Out China’s Belt and Road On August 3, in his first visit to the Asia-Pacific region, new U.S. secretary of defense Mark Esper called out several examples of aggressive conduct by China, including “using predatory economics and debt-for-sovereignty deals.” The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has created some conflicts between recipient governments and international institutions in the past. Perhaps the latest and starkest example is in Pakistan, where a wave of BRI projects was followed by this summer’s bailout by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). When the $62 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was announced in 2015, it should have been easy for followers of the BRI to foresee where the initiative was heading. Even at its initial announced value of $46 billion, the initiative would have amounted to more than 20 percent of Pakistan’s GDP. While details were unclear, as they often are with the BRI, the majority of lending would inevitably come in the form of direct bilateral loans from The Export-Import Bank of China (EXIM) or the China Development Bank (CDB). This was the case for Pakistan’s precedents in Sri Lanka, Kenya, Montenegro, Congo, and other recipients of ambitious bilateral lending initiatives, each of which led to a debt crisis several years later. Any remaining hope that Pakistan would remain the exception to the group ended this spring as the IMF approved a $6 billion bailout for Pakistan as its finances deteriorated. The United States did not attempt to block the bailout despite threats in 2018 to object unless there were assurances that the funding would not be used to service bad Chinese debt. The fact is that money is fungible, and any bailout would, and this bailout will, service bad Chinese debt. According to the IMF’s own analysis, more than 25 percent of Pakistan’s outstanding public debt, and nearly 40 percent of the debt coming due during the IMF program (through 2023) is bilateral or commercial debt to China. Washington may as well have written China a check. That is not to say the United States should have followed through on its threats. Pakistan agreed to very ambitious fiscal reforms (arguably too ambitious to achieve) as part of the bailout. In addition, informal reports in Pakistan have noted that approvals/funding for CPEC and other BRI initiatives have dropped precipitously, though Chinese state-owned media reported no change. Still, Washington and the IMF missed an invaluable opportunity in the Pakistan bailout. The IMF didn’t need to prevent, and indeed could not have prevented, the bailout from indirectly supporting China-financed projects. It could have simply required Pakistan to publicly disclose its contingent liabilities under CPEC by releasing the contracts governing the $62 billion of infrastructure projects planned under the program. Contingent liabilities can have significant negative impacts on public finances, and they are particularly prominent in the infrastructure sector. The massive contracts governments sign for complex infrastructure projects include provisions that often share risk between the government sponsor and the companies/investors involved. If a natural disaster or an unforeseen site condition causes project costs to increase, for instance, the sponsoring government may need to foot the bill. Keeping tabs on the liabilities governments take on for these projects is an important task for governments and the industry of ratings agencies and bond analysts that evaluate public credits. Contingent liabilities for a project can create unforeseen costs for a government, regardless of how a project is financed. The sponsoring government virtually always takes on some risk. However, some standards have emerged in capital markets and banks (promoted by multilateral development banks like the World Bank) regarding whether a general sovereign guarantee supports an infrastructure project or not. In other words, a particular infrastructure project could be financed using public finance (i.e., on the sponsoring government’s balance sheet) or using project finance (i.e., not generally recourse to the sponsoring government and supported only by the economics of the project itself). That is a big distinction in infrastructure finance, and it is a big distinction in sovereign debt markets. A container port, toll road, railway, or airport that doesn’t garner enough shipping, traffic, rail cargo, or air traffic to support its operations can default if it is financed at the project level. If it is financed publicly and underwater economically, it is a liability of the state. Note that this doesn’t necessarily mean the project in question isn’t economically beneficial in aggregate, just that it is not financially viable without the host government’s support. Either public or project finance is a perfectly viable option for financing an infrastructure project, and the alternative that is optimal usually depends on the details of the project in question. The point here isn’t that one option is better than the other, it is that it must be clear which one of these options is being used—to the market, to the lender, and, most certainly, to the government sponsoring the project. This brings us back to Pakistan, the broader BRI, and the IMF bailout. As Chinese bilateral lending has come to dominate the infrastructure bilateral and multilateral lending industry, one significant and critically important shift has been in the prevalence of directly negotiated and not publicly disclosed concession contracts for infrastructure. The specific contractual terms and risk allocation between Chinese state-owned enterprises, Chinese bilateral lenders, and the host nation are often unclear, and it often isn’t even clear whether the project in question is actually happening or just an idea until construction begins. In finance, problems tend to gravitate toward opacity around sovereign guarantees. While some recipients of BRI lending have required the contracts that govern projects to be published, those that have not have clearly been exposed to unexpected and unforeseen contingent liabilities. The delineation of public versus project borrowing is subverted when the contracts used to deliver what is on the surface project finance actually include sovereign guarantees. This has clearly been the case for some BRI projects and led to the allegation of “debt-trap diplomacy” for some BRI recipients. In many cases, the poster children of BRI excess have had difficulty determining just how much they owe as their finances have deteriorated. At this year’s BRI forum, Chinese officials stated that they would push for more transparency in BRI projects. This is laudable. But transparency in international finance should not be subject only to the bilateral policies of lending nations. It should also be enforced by international institutions, like the IMF. The IMF did miss an opportunity in Pakistan this summer, but it wasn’t to prevent or ring-fence a bailout. The IMF should have simply required transparency in the form of published contracts as a precondition for IMF support. The IMF should consider doing so in the future when the next potential exception to BRI excess eventually confirms the rule.

99,2015,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/china-and-russia-economic-unequals,en,"China and Russia: Economic Unequals Available Downloads Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin are attempting to put economics at the center of their strategic partnership. “Economic cooperation and trade, as a key pillar of our relations, is crucial to the common development and revitalization of China and Russia,” Xi said during a visit to Moscow in June 2019.1 “We enjoy an unprecedentedly high level of trust and cooperation,” Putin said several months later. “This is an allied relationship in the full sense of a multifaceted strategic partnership. This is reflected in the economy.”2 Xi and Putin’s signature economic visions even appear complementary at first glance. Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has unleashed Chinese companies to build roads, railways, fiber-optic cables, and other hard infrastructure across the Eurasian supercontinent and beyond. Putin’s Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) harmonizes customs processes to create a single market among Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. The world, and especially where these efforts most directly overlap in Central Asia, needs both “hard” and “soft” infrastructure upgrades. Playing up their personal relationship, Xi and Putin have repeatedly promised to “link” the BRI and EAEU. But they have provided few practical details, leaving observers to speculate about the future of their economic relations. This report examines four dimensions of China-Russia connectivity and reveals a growing partnership that faces structural constraints. Trade is highly concentrated in natural resources, where Chinese and Russian interests most strongly overlap. Investment is constrained by corruption and poor infrastructure in Russia. People-to-people ties have been improving but mistrust remains, as the Covid-19 pandemic has revealed. Even as China and Russia cooperate in building digital infrastructure, each side imposes restrictions that limit data flows. Standing in the way of deeper connections are Russia’s development challenges and both governments’ obsessions with maintaining control.3 After assessing each of these areas, a final section considers the future trajectory of China-Russia economic relations and its implications for U.S. interests. There is room for growth, but as China and Russia’s economic connections strengthen, their partnership will become even more unequal. Russia’s junior status will become more of a liability, and Russian officials could be incentivized to reduce the risk of greater reliance on China. China’s sheer mass, proximity, and willingness to economically coerce its partners could eventually compel Russia to look again to the West, where most of its trade remains despite its growing ties with China. Trade Xi and Putin tout rising bilateral trade levels, a metric that emphasizes progress and partnership while masking how Russia has become more dependent on China. In 2006, Putin announced a goal of increasing bilateral trade to at least $60 billion by 2010. Trade growth stalled from 2010 to 2015 before recovering. The official goal was then raised to $100 billion, which the countries achieved in 2018. Last year, bilateral trade nearly hit $110 billion, and Putin and Xi announced a new goal of $200 billion in trade by 2024.4 Scratching the surface of these numbers reveals a picture that is less promising for Russia. In 2010, China surpassed Germany to become Russia’s largest single trading partner. To be clear, the European Union as a whole remains Russia’s largest partner, responsible for $260 billion (€232 billion) in trade in 2019, more than twice China’s trade with Russia. But China has become more important for Russia in recent years, accounting for 15.5 percent of its total trade in 2018. Russia, in contrast, only accounted for 0.8 percent of China’s total trade in 2018.5 Russia’s largest export, energy, is strategically important, but as the trade relationship becomes even more lopsided, China stands to command more influence as a buyer than Russia does as a supplier. Xi and Putin have underscored that trade cooperation is expanding across sectors, but over the past two decades, it has become more concentrated in raw materials. “The trade structure is diversifying. Of course, energy accounts for over 70 percent of our exports, but this is natural,” Putin said last year.6 He went on to highlight Russia’s exports of nuclear power systems, aircraft, and even a missile warning system. Russia is China’s largest arms supplier, providing 70 percent of China’s arms imports between 2014 and 2018.7 These examples—nuclear, aviation, and arms exports—are politically appealing because they portray Russia as technologically advanced and strengthen the impression of deeper cooperation on strategic issues. But the reality is less flattering for Russia. Russia exported a greater range of products to China during the 1990s, when China was still developing. Now their roles have been reversed.8 As in other higher- value areas, China is increasingly competitive in global arms sales and has surpassed Russia to become the world’s second-largest arms producer.9 Russian firms have accused China of illegally copying Russian military hardware.10 They should be wary. Chinese firms are likely to jettison their Russian partners, as they have with other foreign firms, after becoming self-sufficient in producing more sophisticated gear. The U.S.-China trade war revealed Russia’s eagerness to replace U.S. agriculture exports to China but also highlighted the barriers it faces. “There’s a niche being freed up in China [by the U.S. tariffs] and we can grow into it,” an official in Russia’s Far East told the Wall Street Journal last year. “We can sell all we can grow—the demand is unlimited.”11 But Russia’s ability to grow is limited. Russia’s soybean production was already ramping up prior to the trade war. Rising land costs, poor infrastructure, and bureaucratic red tape all stand in the way of greater output.12 These constraints will not be addressed overnight, but the worse U.S.-China trade relations become, the greater incentive Russian officials have to address them. Russia’s defensive interests limit the most ambitious proposals for deeper integration. Russia drives the EAEU and has pursued relatively modest trade agreements with outside partners to protect its weaker industries.13 The EAEU-China trade agreement, which went into force last year, does not lower tariffs. Russian officials have also resisted establishing a free trade area that covers members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Given China’s sheer size, Russia is likely to continue avoiding deeper free trade arrangements. This strategy is politically understandable but economically self-defeating. The longer Russia waits, the more sophisticated China’s production of higher-value goods becomes. As a result, Russia may find it has less and less to protect. Investment Russia’s underwhelming experience in China’s BRI reveals long-standing barriers to investment. Both countries have an interest in improving infrastructure across the Eurasian supercontinent. Despite sharing a 2,600-mile border, China and Russia have only a handful of railway crossings and roughly 25 crossing points in total. Three of the BRI’s six proposed corridors pass through the EAEU. Given China’s ambitions, and Russia’s need for better infrastructure, the BRI should be a natural match for greater investment. Western sanctions have also forced Russia to look toward China for investment opportunities. The Yamal LNG project, in the Russian arctic, would have been difficult, if not impossible, without Chinese support. China provided financing through its Silk Road Fund, loans from its state policy banks, and investment through a state-owned enterprise. China also used the Silk Road Fund and another state-owned enterprise to invest in Sibur, Russia’s largest petrochemical company.14 Government-to-government cooperation has been critical for China’s largest investments in Russia, which is also trying to attract investments from Japan, India, and Saudi Arabia. But Russia’s risks remain too high and its rewards too low to attract many private investors. Standing in the way of greater investment is Russia’s business environment and weak market fundamentals. The issue is not simply risk aversion among Chinese investors, who have been willing to wade into some of the world’s most challenging business environments, often under the BRI banner. Russia is riskier than developed economies but holds less promise than many developing economies due in part to its declining population. Rather than chart a new chapter for investment, the BRI has been plagued by old challenges. Joint lists of projects have been announced in the past and often win headlines, but ultimately few projects are delivered. In 2009, Hu Jintao and Dmitri Medvedev announced over 200 joint projects. Five years later, less than 10 percent were actually progressing.15 In 2014 and 2015, Russia created 20 special economic zones (SEZs) to attract foreign investment to its Far East. Only six have attracted Chinese investment, which totaled a mere $38 million between 2015 and 2018. The same problems—red tape, poor infrastructure, and corruption—all remain.16 Like all BRI statistics, any estimates of Russia’s participation in the effort require a careful eye. One flagship BRI project, the Moscow-Kazan high-speed railway, has been repeatedly delayed and, like other projects, pre-dates the BRI’s announcement. Its astronomical price tag, $22 billion, has inflated overall estimates of BRI project activity in Russia. In March, Russian officials announced the project would be “postponed.”17 It would not be surprising if the project gets delayed indefinitely. Russian and Chinese officials have little incentive to publicly terminate joint projects, especially those that have taken on symbolic value. Strategic caution may limit some forms of investment. Only a handful of cross-border projects have been completed, most notably two bridges in Russia’s Far East, and the Power of Siberia pipeline. Pipelines are strategically important and economically critical for Russia. Another benefit is that they cannot transport people—let alone military forces. A long history of competition and mistrust makes the recent warming in China-Russia relations all the more striking today. But it also has limits. Russia could decide to keep cross- border transport connections weak as a hedge against China’s growing capabilities. Both sides are eager to reduce their dependence on Western financial systems. China and Russia began using their own currencies for bilateral trade in 2010 and opened their first currency swap line in 2014. Russia’s central bank has shifted some reserves from dollars to euros and yuan, but private companies and households in Russia have been less eager to abandon the dollar. China’s yuan is more widely used than Russia’s ruble but is still used in less than two percent of payments globally.18 Officials have also discussed linking China and Russia’s national payment systems for several years. Here again the imbalance between partners is evident. China’s UnionPay cards can be used globally, while Russia has struggled to get its Mir card system to work internationally.19 Cooperation on digital payment has been expanding but remains limited by Russia’s comparatively small market and aversion to digital currency. Last year, Yandex.Checkout, a joint venture between the tech company Yandex and Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, became the first online retailer in Russia to accept WeChat Pay. China’s AliPay is working on a joint-venture with Mail.ru to offer digital payment services to Russian users.20 The Chinese government is conducting trials for its digital currency, the e-RMB, in four Chinese cities. The head of Russia’s Central Bank, Elvira Nabiullina, has expressed doubts about the need for a digital currency.21 But if Russia were to move ahead, it wou",2013-2017,14,high_conflict
100,2015,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/china-model-beijings-promotion-alternative-global-norms-and-standards,en,"A ‘China Model?’ Beijing’s Promotion of Alternative Global Norms and Standards Available Downloads The following statement by Jonathan E. Hillman, senior fellow of the Simon Chair in Political Economy, and director of the CSIS Reconnecting Asia Project, was provided to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission for a hearing on “A ‘China Model?’ Beijing’s Promotion of Alternative Global Norms and Standards."" Introduction Thank you for the opportunity to testify on China’s promotion of alternative global norms and standards. I will focus on China’s activities in three main areas: - Creating alternative institutions, - Working within existing institutions, and - China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which touches both alternative and existing institutions. As I’ll explain, China’s efforts to establish new institutions require further monitoring, but it would be a mistake to exaggerate their current scale and effectiveness. Beijing’s willingness to start new institutions underscores its global ambitions and adds weight to its rhetoric about creating an alternative order.[1] But the challenges these efforts face are just as revealing. China’s highest-profile initiatives have not delivered on their promises. Many operational and political barriers stand in the way. Most fundamentally, the world is not clamoring for Chinese leadership. The more immediate and higher-stakes battle for influence remains within existing institutions. Having benefitted greatly from participating in existing institutions, China has little to gain from walking away from them. Instead, it is becoming a more influential actor within existing institutions and adopting a variety of strategies—participating, obstructing, or opposing—as individual issues require.[2] In recent years, U.S. neglect of these institutions has provided China more opportunities to advance its interests. Most important, however, are China’s bilateral activities. Beneath the BRI’s multilateral veneer is an ocean of bilateral deals.[3] Every project is a negotiation, and acting bilaterally allows China to be the strongest party at the table, increasing the likelihood that its partners will accept terms that favor Chinese interests. As reputational and financial challenges mount along the BRI, China is exploring ways to “multilateralize” these efforts, but it is unclear whether it is ready to pay the short-term costs required to do so. Sharing these risks requires sharing benefits more equitably and giving up some control. After examining these three areas, I will conclude with brief recommendations for the United States and Congressional action. Shock and Flaw: Alternative Institutions New institutions make great headlines. They often reveal the weaknesses of existing institutions, and in doing so, appear to suggest the status quo cannot hold. If something is beginning, it is tempting to conclude that something else must be ending. When China is behind new institutions, the storylines come easily: Beijing is rising, and Washington is declining. That’s exactly how Beijing likes it, and these narratives are a major incentive for announcing new initiatives. But building effective institutions is incredibly difficult, even more so if they are multilateral. And while the desire for new institutions often does reflect the shortcomings of existing institutions, replacement is a high bar. Historically, the conditions for replacement have come in the aftermath of global conflicts. In the absence of those conditions, replication is more likely than replacement. China’s efforts to build new institutions have understandably generated anxiety, but that shock often distracts from the flaws of its new offerings. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) vividly captures these dynamics. Five years ago, many observers interpreted its launch as directly undermining the United States. “The AIIB is the realisation of a long push by China to rewrite the rules of global economic and financial governance,”[4] one commentator wrote. Another called it “the moment the United States lost its role as the underwriter of the global economic system.”[5] Yet another said, “The United States has lost its way and is rapidly forfeiting claims to global financial, economic, political and moral leadership.”[6] These simple narratives—win-lose, rise-decline—were irresistible. Since then, the AIIB has done more to replicate existing practices than to revise them. Its governing charter borrows extensively from existing MDB charters.[7] Two-thirds of its senior staff spent time at those institutions. Roughly half of its projects have been co-financed with other MDBs. In sum, its policies, people, and processes all reflect existing institutions. It is still early days at the AIIB, of course, and these activities could change. To date, the AIIB has invested roughly $12 billion.[8] To put this into perspective, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) invested roughly that amount in energy, transport, and water, and other infrastructure services in 2018 alone, plus an additional $9 billion in other commitments.[9] As of March 2019, China Development Bank had provided over $190 billion in financing for projects under China’s BRI.[10] Yet the announcement of the AIIB inspired greater anxiety in Washington than the announcement of China’s BRI.[11] And while the worst fears about the AIIB have not yet come to pass, neither have its grand promises of being a new institution that is “lean, clean, and green” – at least in any way that is significantly better than existing MDBs. Its staff is “lean” because it has relied on co-financing arrangements with existing MDBs, which, for the most part, have done the heavy technical lifting in assessing and monitoring projects. Scaling up and becoming more self-sufficient will surely require more staff. Likewise, commitments to anti-corruption (“clean”) are based on existing practices. The AIIB aspires to be “green” but has not ruled out using coal in its energy strategy. The New Development Bank (NDB), originally known as the BRICS Development Bank, is often mentioned alongside the AIIB, but it has several important distinctions.[12] It is less transparent than the AIIB and provides less project documentation to the public. It does not participate in the cross-disbarment processes of the leading MDBs, which suspend firms for fraud and corruption. The NDB’s social and environmental standards are also less developed than the AIIB’s. It has invested $10.2 billion since beginning operations in 2016, with all its projects occurring within the five participating countries. Other constraints suggest the NDB will remain a relatively marginal institution. Since it is an institution by five countries, for the benefit of those five countries, its reach is limited. Differences among the five countries pose challenges as well. Sanctions against Russia, for example, have made it more difficult to lend to Russian companies. New Delhi played a more active role in its founding than did Beijing, and tensions between them could limit cooperation in the future. What its members do have in common are poor credit ratings, which limits the NDB’s ability to raise capital. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is another effort that appears more consequential than it is in reality. It was founded in 1995 as the “Shanghai Five” to focus on combatting the “three evils” of extremism, terrorism, and separatism. In 2001, Uzbekistan joined, and the group was renamed the SCO. Until recently, China and Russia have set the agenda for the most part, but the SCO operates by consensus, which limits its agency. In 2017, India and Pakistan became members. While their participation increases the top-line statistics that the SCO can claim in terms of population and GDP, it only makes reaching consensus more difficult. In recent years, China has tried to expand the SCO’s economic agenda. It has floated the idea of a trade agreement among members and a development bank, but neither effort has moved forward. Moscow wants to protect its interests in the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union, and is wary of deeper economic integration, despite official promises to “link” it with China’s BRI. India’s joining the SCO also further complicates trade efforts. The SCO continues to generate intrigue as a non-Western arena for global governance, but these bigger economic efforts remain aspirational.[13] China is also laying the foundation for alternative financial institutions – a broad set of activities that warrants a separate hearing. Briefly, I will focus specifically on China’s credit ratings, as the Commission requested. Important related areas include China’s bilateral swap agreements, its development of digital currency, e-commerce, and other financial services. The United States remains in a strong position in international financial systems, but the benefits that flow from the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency are often taken for granted.[14] The overuse of U.S. sanctions unintentionally gives momentum to China’s alternatives and could erode the U.S. ability to use these tools of financial statecraft. Credit ratings are consequential because they influence the interest rates that companies and governments pay. Higher ratings signal lower risk of default, giving investors the confidence to offer lower rates. The “Big Three” credit rating agencies are Standard & Poor’s (S&P), Moody’s, and Fitch Group, and all are either based in the U.S. or dual-headquartered in New York and London (Fitch). On occasion, typically following downgrades of China’s sovereign debt, Chinese officials have accused these firms of bias.[15] China has struggled to develop its own ratings agencies, which lack the independence and trust that the “Big Three” have developed over time. Of China’s nine domestic rating agencies, five have some degree of state ownership.[16] These domestic agencies have been generous, with 80 percent of their ratings at AA or higher.[17] One study found that domestic ratings were 6-7 notches higher, on average, than ratings by global agencies.[18] This is an economic equivalent of the Lake Wobegon effect: In China, all economic fundamentals are strong, all debt is good-looking, and all companies are above average. Ratings also reflect, and can influence, governance norms. Although technical, they essentially make judgements about the strengths and weaknesses of the entities they rate. An alternative way of evaluating risk is not simply a pronouncement that an interest rate should be adjusted. In the case of sovereign ratings, it can also reflect judgements about whether state interventions in the economy, and control of society, are viewed positively or negatively. One of China’s oldest rating agencies, Dagong, is a cautionary tale. China’s domestic agencies have focused on domestic municipal and corporate ratings, but in 2010, Dagong ventured into providing sovereign ratings. It gifted China an AA+ rating, and demoted the United States to an AA rating. By 2018, the company was issuing ratings for almost 90 countries.[19] As my colleague Scott Kennedy has found, Dagong was systematically underrating democracies and overrating authoritarian regimes. No one took this stunt seriously, as Kennedy points out, but the ratings could “reinforce other prominent norms favored by Beijing, including state intervention in the economy and regime control of information and the internet.”[20] Because China does not have a rating agency with the name recognition and trustworthiness of the Big Three, it may be better served by coopting existing rating agencies. Last year, China granted the first approval to a foreign credit rating agency, S&P Global, to rate China’s domestic debt. S&P uses the same range of ratings to grade China’s domestic debt as it does internationally, but the ratings are not intended to be equivalent. This could change in the future, but even if technica",2013-2017,13,high_conflict
101,2015,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/china-pakistan-economic-corridor-five,en,"The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor at Five Available Downloads THE ISSUE The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) that was off icially launched in April 2015, promised transformational gains. Five years later, a quarter of announced projects have been completed, energy projects dominate, and industrialization efforts are lagging, according to data collected by the CSIS Reconnecting Asia Project and made available to the public here. KEY FINDINGS - Scaled-back Ambitions: Of 122 announced projects, a quarter (32 projects) have been completed, or roughly $20 billion of the estimated $87 billion in funding. While this is a significant amount of activity, particularly in the transport and energy sectors, it also highlights a gap between projects announced and completed. - Energy Focus Carries Environmental Costs: Energy projects account for nearly two-thirds of CPEC funding, and nearly 40 percent of the planned generation capacity uses coal, despite ongoing concerns about the high public health costs of pollution in Pakistan. - Stuck on the Value Chain: Despite promises to turn Pakistan into a higher-value manufacturing hub, the vast majority of special economic zones (SEZs) remain empty, and information and communication technology (ICT) projects have been limited. SCALED-BACK AMBITIONS Since the CPEC’s official announcement in 2015, Chinese and Pakistani officials have declared it a success. “Good progress has been made in building the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor,” Xi Jinping told Pakistan’s parliament during his visit in April 2015. (While the CPEC has a much longer history, and includes projects started earlier, Xi’s visit marked its formal announcement.) Three years later, a joint statement declared: “As a signature project of BRI, the fast development of the CPEC has played a significant role in the Belt and Road cooperation.” At last year’s Belt and Road Forum, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said: “The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, one of the BRI’s major components—and one of its earliest manifestations—has made substantial progress.” Using official targets, however, the CPEC has underperformed. “By 2020 . . . major bottlenecks to Pakistan’s economic and social development shall be basically addressed, and the CPEC shall start to boost the economic growth along it for both countries,” a joint planning document promised in 2017. By 2018, Pakistan was again facing unsustainable debt levels and sought assistance from China, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. In 2019, Pakistan received a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, and its economy mostly appeared to be moving in reverse: growth slowed to 3.3 percent, inflation hit a five-year high, and deficits soared. The CPEC is not responsible for all Pakistan’s troubles, of course, but it has exacerbated long-standing challenges. Progress on the ground provides some clues, revealing where projects have succeeded and failed and illustrating how the CPEC’s grand ambitions have been scaled back. Of 122 announced projects, only a quarter (32 projects) have been completed, or roughly $20 billion of the estimated $87 billion in funding. Less than half (54 out of 122 projects) are completed or under construction. These activities reflect a broad definition that counts projects announced by either side as well as media reports associating them with the CPEC. Dropping large projects that have been shelved, such as the Diamer-Bhasha Dam, the Pakistan-Iran gas line, and the Muzaffargarh Coal Power Project, brings the overall total to $67 billion. Announced project funding (excluding national and cross-border projects) is distributed roughly evenly across Pakistan’s provinces, with the exception of the most developed (AJK) and two least-developed provinces (Balochistan and FATA). This has played out in project completion rates as well, with the most and least developed provinces having no completed projects so far, and the moderately developed provinces of Punjab and Sindh approaching completion rates of 50 percent. Two of the three provinces with no completed projects (excluding cross-border links), AJK and Gilgit Baltistan, are located in Pakistan-administered parts of the Kashmir region in dispute by India and do not have representation in Pakistan’s national parliament. *Source: “Subnational Human Development Index (4.0),” Radboud University Global Data Lab, https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/shdi/?interpolation=0&extrapolation=0&nearest_ real=0. HDI scores are calculated based on the UN Human Development Index using a scale from 0 to 1, with 1 being the highest level of development. While still lagging behind Punjab and Sindh, Balochistan has fared slightly better than other provinces, with 24 percent of announced projects complete to date and announced funding levels above the national per capita average (although per capita comparison’s across provinces are difficult due to incomplete population statistics). Balochistan is home to Gwadar port, the CPEC’s “anchor” and the site of more than half of the province’s projects, as well as some of the CPEC’s strongest opposition. ENERGY FOCUS CARRIES ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS Pakistan currently faces an energy deficit of 3,000 MW during peak demand—an issue that successive governments have made a top priority for the CPEC since 2013. Although energy projects, including power plants, pipelines, and transmission projects, account for nearly two-thirds of announced funding, much of that is concentrated in large projects that have since been delayed or shelved. - Shelving of Large Energy Projects: Energy projects account for 14 of the 20 most expensive CPEC projects, but several have since been shelved. While this is beneficial in cases where project risks could outweigh their benefits, it has resulted in major funding losses for some provinces, and only 34 percent of energy projects have been completed overall. This is particularly true in Balochistan and Punjab, where energy projects account for around 60 percent of announced CPEC funding, but in each province two projects that make up nearly half of that spending have been shelved. In Gilgit Baltistan, the shelving of a single $14 billion hydropower plant meant the loss of 98 percent of CPEC funds to the province. - Prolonging Fossil-fuel Dependency: 38 percent of the generation capacity from active CPEC projects comes from coal, despite criticism from locals and environmental groups and assurances from the government that it would work with China to address environmental concerns “at all costs.” Wind and solar account for only 8 percent of generation capacity under the CPEC, while hydro projects account for 54 percent. Reaching Pakistan’s goal of sourcing 30 percent of energy from wind and solar by 203 0 would require a significant shift in CPEC’s energy mix. This remains the case despite concerns about the public health impacts of pollution in the country, to which coal generation is a major contributor. Three of the world’s most polluted cities are located in Pakistan, and air pollution results in the death of an estimated 128,000 annually. STUCK ON THE VALUE CHAIN The CPEC’s supporters claimed it would help industrialize Pakistan, turning it into a manufacturing hub. “CPEC will greatly speed up the industrialization and urbanization process in Pakistan and help it grow into a highly inclusive, globally competitive and prosperous country capable of providing high-quality life to its citizens,” promises a joint planning document. While energy and transportation projects are critical for this transition, spending on other important areas, such as manufacturing and ICT projects, has lagged. - Empty Special Economic and Industrial Zones: Prime Minister Imran Khan has emphasized the importance of SEZs and industrial zones to the CPEC since he was elected in 2018, but little progress has been made. Although 11 SEZs and other types of industrial zones are currently planned as part of CPEC, only one (in Gwadar) has actually been completed, with another in Punjab under construction. Gwadar is also the only SEZ in which China has legal authority, suggesting that the government of Pakistan bears responsibility for the lack of progress in the other SEZs. - Significant ICT Needs, Mixed Implementation: As of 2017, only 15.5 percent of households had access to the internet, but only eight CPEC projects are ICT-related. While projects such as the Kashgar to Islamabad fiber-optic line and expansion of 3G and 4G service along the Karakoram Highway directly address these needs, reporting on safe city projects, such as the system in Islamabad, suggests that some ICT projects that have been completed have not lived up to expectations. These areas are expected to receive more attention in the years ahead. The second phase of CPEC, which began in late 2019, promises to stimulate economic growth, with a focus on industrialization, agriculture, and socio- economic development. Facing a harsher economic environment, however, China and Pakistan may be forced to make additional tradeoffs between completing energy and transportation projects that were started during the first phase and focusing on these areas. Canceling more big-ticket projects could be financially wise but politically challenging given the CPEC’s symbolic importance to Xi’s signature foreign policy vision. But if Pakistan does not carefully steer the Belt and Road’s flagship during the next five years, it could find itself scrambling for the lifeboats.

102,2015,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/competing-chinas-digital-silk-road,en,"Competing with China’s Digital Silk Road This commentary is part of CSIS's Global Forecast 2021 essay series. Former U.S. secretary of state Dean Acheson’s call to create “situations of strength” is reemerging as a compass for U.S. foreign policy. But that phrase also aptly describes the challenge that China’s global economic activities present, especially in developing and emerging markets, where it is delivering digital infrastructure that shifts the strategic landscape in its favor. The Biden administration needs a strategy for competing with China’s Digital Silk Road that begins at home. The next phase of U.S.-China technology competition is just starting. Last year, an initial wave of countries decided against including Chinese equipment in their 5G networks. There are degrees of difference among their decisions, including whether suppliers are singled out by name and whether equipment is entirely banned or limited to the network periphery. But overwhelmingly, these countries are wealthy democracies. That leaves the rest of the world, including a long list of countries with varying levels of development and governance, where competition is set to intensify. China is racing ahead in many of these markets through its Digital Silk Road, which sits at the intersection of three major state-backed initiatives. It was first introduced in 2015 as part of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s signature foreign policy vision, the Belt and Road Initiative. It also advances “Made in China 2025” and “China Standards 2035,” through which Beijing aspires to lead advanced manufacturing and standard setting, respectively. There is plenty of hype in each of these efforts, but they signal serious ambitions. The Digital Silk Road advances China’s bid for technological independence at home while moving it toward the center of global networks. It takes aim at next-generation technology and next-generation markets. The Digital Silk Road is well-timed, dovetailing with powerful, longer-running trends. China is already the world’s leading exporter of communications technology, and it is increasingly competitive in delivering advanced systems, such as subsea cables, that only the United States and its allies could provide just over a decade ago. Digital infrastructure is becoming even more essential to modern economies with the arrival of faster networks, cheaper sensors, and the proliferation of connected devices. The potential for growth in the developing world is vast. Asia and Africa, where demand for international bandwidth is growing fastest, are expected to account for 90 percent of global population growth through 2050. More recent drivers are accelerating the Digital Silk Road. Chinese suppliers, encountering greater scrutiny in advanced economies, are now doubling down in developing economies. They are also responding to Xi’s call at home to build “new infrastructure,” including 5G networks, data centers, and other digital infrastructure, which will create greater capacity for exporting these systems abroad. Meanwhile, the pandemic has battered economies while making digital infrastructure even more essential. Compared to large transport and energy projects, digital infrastructure projects tend to take less time to deliver, cost less, and are less disruptive to their immediate surroundings, all advantages after a bumpy start to China’s Belt and Road. Beijing is hoping Washington is too consumed with domestic challenges to respond. As China builds the systems that underpin communications, finance, and essential government functions in capitals around the world, it is accumulating intelligence and building coercive power. Vulnerabilities are already materializing, from the repeated security failures at the African Union’s headquarters to Papua New Guinea’s data center disaster. Countries aiming to “leapfrog” in their development risk falling into digital dependency. China has already demonstrated a willingness to coerce its partners with other forms of connectivity. But this challenge, if channeled correctly, could strengthen the U.S. economy. Exports support well-paying jobs, growth, and investments in research and development. Either U.S. workers and companies can enjoy those benefits by succeeding in foreign markets, or China and other countries will. The more of the global market Chinese firms control, the greater their ability to set standards and develop the next generation of transformational technologies. The United States does not have a domestic market of China’s size upon which to fall back. To achieve the scale necessary to remain at the leading edge of innovation, U.S. companies need to compete in foreign markets. And to compete, they need a compelling sales pitch. The United States needs a new approach that appeals to the aspirations of developing countries. The Trump administration’s main argument to countries considering including Chinese equipment in their 5G networks was centered around security concerns. Those concerns are compelling, but even wealthy democracies were reluctant to swallow the additional costs of safer alternatives. In the developing world, resources are even more limited, and many officials assume that any foreign provider could present a security risk. Put simply, fear won’t stop China’s Digital Silk Road. Competing requires putting forward a positive vision and offering attractive alternatives. The Biden administration has several opportunities to meet this challenge, starting with its efforts at home. As part of a domestic infrastructure package, it can improve connectivity for Americans while investing in technologies that shift the global communications playing field in favor of the United States and its allies. Open RAN, for example, allows operators to mix and match different network components from different vendors rather than choosing and potentially being locked into a single supplier. U.S. companies are leaders in producing the key components and software for these systems, which could mature faster and scale globally with domestic deployments. The Biden administration can also strengthen the position of the United States in global subsea cables networks. Subsea cables carry the vast majority of international data, including everything from streaming videos and telephone calls to transactions for credit cards, ATMs, and stock exchanges. To encourage these connections and the resiliency they provide, the administration should protect existing cables and improve the cable planning process by creating a single federal point of contact. While Team Telecom improves the predictability of the cable approval process at home, the U.S. State Department should redouble its efforts to remove obstacles to cable installation and repair in foreign markets. As it looks to foreign markets, the Biden administration inherits an expanded economic toolkit that requires better coordination. The U.S. Development Finance Corporation has equity authority and an increased portfolio cap, which should be used to put a greater emphasis on digital infrastructure. The U.S. Export-Import Bank has lowered domestic content requirements for 10 sectors, including telecommunications, which should expand its pool of potential projects. Other agencies—including the Departments of Defense, State, Commerce, and Homeland Security, U.S. Agency for International Development, and Trade and Development Agency—all have important capabilities to bring to bear. The National Security Council needs a point person for global connectivity issues, so these efforts become at least the sum of their parts, and hopefully more. Digital infrastructure should be near the top of the list as the Biden administration looks to deepen cooperation with partners and allies. Any new administration needs time for consultation, and thankfully, there is promising work upon which to build. The Blue Dot Network brought together the United States, Japan, and Australia to certify high-quality infrastructure projects. That basic effort should continue in some form and expand to include European partners, which were initially reluctant to join due to concerns over environmental standards. The existing partners should move forward with any environmentally sound projects already in the pipeline while working to bring European partners on board. Within the digital realm, smart cities should be a high priority for allied cooperation. Chinese companies are already using the pandemic to sell more surveillance systems and other smart city systems, often under the “safe city” brand. Their products come with big promises for economic growth, lower crime, and artificially low prices that often neglect operating and maintenance costs. In addition to raising human rights concerns, these “safe city” systems have a mixed track record when it comes to delivering on their promises. Experiences in Kenya and Pakistan point toward data security and operating issues. These shortcomings provide an opening for better alternatives. The United States and its allies should put forward a higher-standard model for smart cities. For example, they could offer a “Sustainable City” certification with financial support that emphasizes commercial viability, energy efficiency, social safeguards, and data security. This is another area where U.S. domestic and international efforts strongly align. U.S. and Japanese companies are already collaborating, including a project in Las Vegas, where Dell and NTT are suppliers. More cutting-edge examples of U.S. smart cities will position domestic companies to succeed abroad. The State and Commerce Departments should bring U.S. mayors on a global roadshow to share their experiences with foreign counterparts. All of these efforts could feed into, and benefit from, broader allied cooperation on technology issues. The list of areas for cooperation is endless, spanning both defensive and offensive measures, from coordinating export controls and strengthening supply chains to pooling resources for joint R&D and investment funds. But while a foundation is put into place for broader allied cooperation, the Biden administration should put some early points on the board, meaning actual projects, and build further from there.

103,2015,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/development-response-anti-corruption,en,"The Development Response to Anti-corruption Q1: Why is everyone suddenly talking about anti-corruption? A1: In early June, the Biden-Harris administration issued a National Security Study Memorandum (NSSM) declaring corruption a core national security priority. The president's 2022 budget request included $50 million for rapid response efforts to take advantage of “crucial windows of opportunity” to fight corruption. The NSSM coincided with the U.S. high-level delegation to the historic UN General Assembly Special Session against Corruption (UNGASS), a collection of parties of the UN Convention against Corruption. The UNGASS resulted in a UNGASS political declaration which has been both lauded and critiqued by advocates. The declaration was followed in short order by a G7 statement calling for shared action on corruption through improved sharing of information on illicit finance. Later the same week, the United States and the European Union issued a summit statement that included a commitment to combating corruption across financial, economic, and political systems. Of course, the challenge of corruption is not new or easy. According to the World Economic Forum, $2 trillion is lost to corruption a year, with developing countries bearing the brunt of the costs. Yet, the uptick in discussion of corruption suggests there is an opening for new ways to take on the endemic challenge, including by placing development tools at the heart of the response. The recent international commitments on anti-corruption will only be as strong as the ability of the respective development agencies—namely the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)—to coordinate more effectively within the U.S. government and with our allies and to take a long-term, systemic approach to combating the problem. Q2: What role will development play in anti-corruption? A2: USAID’s anti-corruption portfolio has ebbed and flowed in recent years. According to a USAID data set, between 2007 and 2013, the agency had some 300 projects on anti-corruption across 74 countries, valued at just over $6 billion, with Afghanistan and Iraq constituting the largest programs. Based largely on those experiences, USAID issued a programming guide on anti-corruption in 2015 to provide guidance for practitioners. Despite the investments during that period, these projects mostly remained siloed from other efforts and were not able to achieve broader impacts to such a complex problem. There is only one full-time career staff member with an anti-corruption portfolio and the original USAID strategy on anti-corruption (2004) is considered to have reached “sunset,” meaning it is far past its five-year lifespan and has not been updated or renewed. In the last two months, USAID has made very exciting steps toward anti-tacklingcorruption, including the establishment of a task force and the announcement of an executive director to run it, reporting directly to the administrator. To be successful, this task force will need to ensure linkages between anti-corruption efforts and the many bureaus and operating units across the U.S. government and the globe. This critical organizational buy-in, as well as opportunities and mechanisms to reimagine the way projects are designed and managed with the input and participation of those on the front lines of the work in developing countries (through nimbler contract and grant-making vehicles), is the difference between a successful and unsuccessful task force within the USAID. The task force will need to map existing anti-corruption programs and think through existing gaps and good practices. While a new rapid response mechanism opens up new space, the task force will need to think through larger institutional capacity, including the linkages to other key sectors and policy objectives. To do so, development experts should borrow from analogous policy areas, such as stabilization, that can support and then link local actions to broader national-level policy goals. The 2017 Stabilization Assistance Review highlighted the alignment of assistance behind a locally driven, globally legitimized objective as an important component of its success. The same is likely true for anti-corruption and a strong relationship between interagency partners will help ensure it. Q3: What multilateral structures are necessary? A3: Establishing USAID’s task force will be concurrent to a UN process (run out of the secretary general’s office) of developing a comprehensive framework “to support States in their efforts to measure corruption, its impact, and all relevant aspects of preventing and combating it.” This outcome from the UNGASS political declaration represents an opportunity for the U.S. government (USG) to be influential in how the UN system is thinking through corruption and to ensure widespread inclusion of development tools, including those run by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). Civil society actors and activists also need to have a voice in both the UN processes and U.S. policy development. As another outcome of UNGASS, the USG announced its intent to host a follow-up conference of states working on anti-corruption in 2023. This deadline, alongside the nearer-term Summit of Democracies, is an important milestone for those working on development responses to anti-corruption. Another important juncture is the High-level Political Forum this month, to account for member states’ progress on Sustainable Development Goal 16 on peace, justice, and security. The nexus between the objectives of SDG 16, a just recovery to the Covid-19 pandemic, countering authoritarian influence, and anti-corruption is clearer than ever. Q4: What is the legislative agenda on anti-corruption? A4: The impact of Covid-19 on corruption around the world has also prompted the U.S. Congress to get involved. There are several bills circulating focused on addressing corruption, illustrating a strong linkage between the executive and legislative branches. Many have their origins in the bipartisan Congressional Caucus against Foreign Corruption and Kleptocracy, created in June 2021, and the Helsinki Commission. The first bill, the Countering Russian and Other Overseas Kleptocracy (CROOK) Act, was introduced by Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) and Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS). The act supports programs that combat corruption and strengthen the rule of law, including through the creation of a rapid-response Anti-Corruption Action Fund. This fund would be supported by penalties on Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations over $50 million, with the expectation that this would generate around $15–30 million a year, thus allowing the action fund to be budget neutral. Unlike its 2019 predecessor, the 2021 CROOK Act has broad support. It also calls for an interagency task force to coordinate across the USG (beyond the USAID taskforce, but likely connected to it). The Justice for Victims of Kleptocracy Act of 2021, introduced by Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), would mandate a published list of money stolen by kleptocracies and recovered by U.S. law enforcement. Representatives John Curtis (R-UT) and Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) introduced the Foreign Corruption Accountability Act, which closes a preexisting loophole and finally allows the Unites States to block visas of foreign private citizens who engage in corruption. Senators Ben Cardin (D-MD) and Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS) introduced the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, a reauthorization of a 2012 law, which, in addition to blocking visas, allows the United States to block property under U.S. jurisdiction and restrict Americans from engaging in business with those found to have engaged in human rights abuses or corruption. Finally, Representatives Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) and Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) introduced the Golden Visa Accountability Act, which creates a database of global visa denials to prevent corrupt officials from purchasing visas. Q5: What should development practitioners be thinking about as this moves forward? A5: Secretary of State Blinken called countering corruption “absolutely essential” to U.S. foreign policy. To get it right, a more systemic approach to development programming will be a core tool of this objective. USAID should begin the process of a new anti-corruption strategy, building on the following five priority areas: - Enhance Capacity: The 2019 CSIS report Fighting Corruption for U.S. Economic and National Security Interests called corruption the major obstacle for the international development objectives and highlighted the need for strategic approaches backed by technocratic and niche programming. Issues around procurement reform, illicit financing, tax conventions, and financial integrity should serve as the foundation for international collaborative action. While the National Security Council has started the necessary strategy and policy processes, practitioners should begin reviewing current USG institutional capacity to not only provide technical support to developing country governments, but also design new procurement and contracting mechanisms to meet their varied and complex needs. - Apply Innovative Methods: A strategic development approach to corruption will require innovative approaches and methods that take on the complex and fluid system of addressing governance norms. This will require mainstreaming throughout all development sectors, as well as training for technical staff focal points in systems thinking and adaptive management. Research shows that national-level institutional reforms and legalistic enforcement approaches should be coupled with programs and approaches that address social norms, which are an important driver of meaningful behavior change needed for reforms to be successful. New methodologies like the University of Sussex mapping method and corruption functionality framework should be deployed collectively with other development agencies in-country and with local partners to jointly identify the key players in corruption or influence networks and reveal their roles and interconnections in an increasingly fluid framework. - Utilize Technology: The anti-corruption strategy should include robust engagement with digital development practitioners who are thinking through new technological tools. The World Economic Forum's Technology for Integrity platform and the UNDP effort to harness technology in support of the Agenda 2030 framework serve as early best practices. - Align with National Security: USAID should carefully understand the intersection between corruption and other ongoing national security priorities, specifically countering malign actors and the emerging relationship with China. In the latter case, development professionals urgently need better visibility on the corrosive practices and increasing levels of corruption associated with China's Belt and Road Initiative. For example, in Malaysia, Chinese officials inflated infrastructure costs in a shadowy attempt to bail out the national development fund. Policymakers should understand the impact of corruption alongside large-scale infrastructure projects and their larger impact on local networks and transparency, as well as U.S. national security interests. - Localize Support: Development is well suited for anti-corruption because it is bottom-up in nature. It is poised to address long-standing divides that exist between elites and their grassroots counterparts. USAID’s deep networks are ready for the task but will require a commitment to supporting regional and transnational networks of anti-corruption movement leaders to share tactics, resources, and moral support. This might include direct support to anti-corruption advocates and investigative journalists who have increasingly become targeted for government harassment and abuse. The U.S. government should signal to local actors that they will be supported politically and financially to ",2013-2017,66,high_conflict
104,2015,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/dfis-drive-development-agenda-center-stage,en,"DFIs Drive the Development Agenda to Center Stage The development finance landscape has changed dramatically in recent years. It is broadly accepted that the private sector plays a crucial role in development, and Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) are one of the best ways to enable private enterprise. DFIs are government- or quasi-government-backed institutions that provide equity, loans, and other financial support for private-sector projects in low- and middle-income countries. DFIs seek to invest in commercially sustainable projects, often in concert with private investors, that may struggle to attract commercial investors for a variety of reasons. DFIs are not new. The United Kingdom created its DFI—the CDC Group (formerly the Commonwealth Development Corporation)—in 1948; the International Finance Corporation (IFC) was established in 1956; and the United States’ Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) was spun out of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in 1971. The Association of 15 European DFIs (EDFI) is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, having been founded in 1992, at a time when DFIs were just beginning to gain recognition. In the fall of 2016, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), in partnership with the EDFI, released a report, titled Development Finance Institutions Come of Age. The report underscored the importance of DFIs for international development and stated that these institutions were going to grow at a very high rate and that official development assistance will remain relatively the same. About 18 months later, a number of events have taken place that largely corroborate our findings that DFIs are moving to center stage. DFIs are adjusting to a dynamic and changing economy and they are needed now more than ever. The Growing Importance of DFIs in the Global Economy The various international development agreements have concluded that while Official Development Assistance (ODA) has an important role (the term that is used is “catalytic”), ODA is not going to solve the challenges of the developing world. A variety of other sources of financing are going to be more central, including foreign direct investment, local private savings, and taxes collected by developing countries among others. The phrase describing this conclusion is moving from “billions” to “trillions.” In the words of the Financial Times’ chief economics commentator, Martin Wolf, “We have no hope in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) without high growth in poor countries.” DFIs played a modest role in development policy at first, and few experts anticipated the growth of private investment in emerging and frontier markets over the past two decades. From 2000 to now, the total annual commitments by all DFIs (bilateral and multilateral) has grown from $10 billion to around $70 billion, an increase of 600 percent. ODA grew by roughly 50 percent over the same period. DFIs’ new commitments for 2015 were around $71.2 billion, slightly lower than the projection in our report last fall of $76 billion. The drop in new commitments by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and IFC, $4 billion and $7 billion respectively in 2015, can explain most of the difference. The amount of new commitments tends to fluctuate substantially from year and year, but the trend over the past 15 years still supports the theory that DFIs are growing at a higher rate than ODA. Even though the level of new commitments by DFIs as a whole was slightly lower in 2015, OPIC and the CDC Group, two of the world’s leading DFIs, still experienced tremendous growth. OPIC’s new commitments grew from $3.0 billion to $4.4 billion, a 47 percent increase, and the CDC Group’s new commitments grew by 140 percent. EDFIs’ new investments in 2016 reached $8 billion, and their total portfolio has expanded to represent close to $50 billion. Most DFIs are taking on more investment activity, and it remains likely that DFIs’ investments will surpass ODA in the medium term. DFIs are coming of age, but the shifts over the past year and a half present uncertainty—challenges as well as opportunities. Political and Economic Shifts The United States and United Kingdom have seen massive changes in policy over the past year with the election of President Donald Trump and Brexit. The “skinny budget” proposed by the Trump administration called for the elimination of OPIC, the zeroing out of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, as well as a 30 percent cut to traditional U.S. foreign aid. Ultimately, the Trump administration named a strong leadership team to OPIC, and both the House and Senate foreign aid funding bills have included funding for the agency. Contrary to his original “skinny budget,” in his remarks at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit in Vietnam, President Trump announced his commitment to reforming the United States’ development finance institutions to better incentivize private-sector investments in Asia. China has become a soft power competitor to the United States through the Belt and Road Initiative (formerly called “One Belt, One Road”) and the emergence of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the New Development Bank. The Belt and Road Initiative targets improving trade and connectivity between China and 65 countries. The two multilateral development banks that China cofounded, the AIIB and New Development Bank, are up and running. The AIIB is already half the size of the World Bank and two-thirds the size of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In 2016, the New Development Bank had initial authorized capital of $100 billion and approved seven infrastructure loan projects totaling over $1.5 billion. Two of China’s “policy banks”—the China Development Bank and the China Export-Import Bank—hold around the same total international assets as all of the Western multilateral development banks combined. New Leadership in DFIs There have been recent changes in leadership at many of the largest DFIs, including IFC, OPIC, CDC, the Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO), and France’s Proparco. Elizabeth Littlefield stepped down as the head of OPIC after serving as president and CEO since 2009. Ray Washburne was confirmed as president and CEO of OPIC by the U.S. Senate in August 2017 and has already begun to expand their operations. OPIC recently announced an agreement with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and the Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) focused on strengthening key sectors like infrastructure and energy in emerging markets in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. In 2017, Diana Noble stepped down as CEO of the CDC Group after six years at the helm. Nick O’Donohoe took office as CEO in June of this year, and his strategy is expected to continue to evolve. In October, the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DfID) announced a capital increase of up to £703 million per year to the CDC Group for the next five years, signaling its interest in becoming one of the largest DFIs in the world. In early 2016, the IFC saw major changes in its leadership with Philippe Le Houérou becoming CEO and Joaquim Levy becoming managing director and World Bank CFO. Le Houérou’s selection and close ties to the development side of the World Bank represented a change in policy, as the IFC is typically led by bankers from the private sector. The IFC has been criticized in the past for focusing too heavily on financial returns and ignoring the “development” side of development finance. In 2016 after 29 years at the FMO, Nanno Kleiterp stepped down as chief executive and became chairman of EDFI. He was replaced by Jürgen Rigterink who had served as a member of FMO’s management board since 2008. FMO remains one of the largest bilateral private-sector development banks in the world. In 2016, Grégory Clemente became CEO of Proparco, which operates in 80 countries and whose investments total around $6.3 billion. He replaced Claude Periou who had served as CEO twice, totaling eight years in charge. New Approaches and Instruments for Development Finance “Blended finance” approaches have also become a key topic in development finance policy discussions. Blended finance refers to the use of development finance and philanthropic funds to mobilize private capital in emerging and frontier markets. Some DFIs worry that the excessive use of blended finance could distort markets. In addition to the World Bank, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has been exploring principles for how and when foreign aid donors can use money and grants to leverage private-sector investment. In October 2017, more than 20 development finance institutions, including the European DFIs and the IFC, endorsed enhanced principles on the implementation of blended concessional finance for private-sector operations. The report produced by this working group focused on providing clear guidance on how to implement blended-finance transactions in different development contexts. “Impact investing” is a new approach where investments are made not only to create financial returns but also to have a beneficial social or environmental impact. The IFC reports that nearly 90 percent of its clients support the environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) standards and see them as critical to their long-term business success. Impact investing is one way that the private sector can support efforts to achieve the SDGs. Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) have been called on to increase their reach in development via innovative approaches. One such call is by further leveraging their balance sheets to lend at higher volumes. In 2015, the Asian Development Bank merged its concessional and nonconcessional balance sheets. The merger of the Asian Development Fund (ADF) lending operations and ordinary capital resources (OCR) was a step toward improving operations and is expected to raise ADB annual loan and grant approvals by 50 percent. In November 2015, the Canadian-led MDB Action Plan to Optimize Balance Sheets was agreed to by G20 Leaders, and in July 2016, MDBs submitted their own report to G20 finance ministers. Another innovation that impacts the DFI sector was the rollout in April 2017 of the World Bank Group’s “Cascade” approach, which helps create markets and leverage more private financing. The Cascade approach is currently focused on infrastructure projects but should be expanded to finance, education, health, and agribusiness. The Cascade uses policy reforms and institution building to mobilize private-sector investment for projects in the poorest and most fragile countries. Moreover, the World Bank’s 18th replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA 18) allocated $2.5 billion to IFC and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) for a new private-sector window to catalyze private-sector investment in the 75 poorest countries, especially those that are fragile and conflict affected. IDA 18 also included a blended-finance facility within the private-sector window to mitigate various financial risks by providing loans, equity, and guarantees to pioneering IFC investments across sectors with high development impact. The new European external investment plan (EIP) released in September 2016 is based on three pillars: mobilizing investment through the new investment fund and its guarantee; technical assistance to develop economically viable projects; and cooperation programs and dialogue to improve economic governance and promote a better business environment. The European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD) supports the first pillar by mobilizing investments by public financial institutions and the private sector in Africa and the EU neighborhood in order to stem the migration crisis and contribute to the SDGs.

105,2015,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/g7s-new-global-infrastructure-initiative,en,"The G7’s New Global Infrastructure Initiative Group of Seven (G7) leaders meeting in Cornwall, England, on June 11-13 agreed on a new initiative to support global infrastructure investment, launched as global needs rise and China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) pulls back. Details on the initiative were sparse in the lengthy G7 communiqué, but the Biden White House issued a more detailed fact sheet dubbing the initiative “Build Back Better World (B3W)” and describing it as “a values-driven, high-standard, and transparent infrastructure partnership led by major democracies to help narrow the $40+ trillion infrastructure need in the developing world.” The core of the initiative involves catalyzing private capital to invest in global infrastructure, with a focus on four areas: climate, health and health security, digital technology, and gender equity and equality. Q1: What prompted this initiative? A1: The United States and other G7 countries have developed common concerns about China’s ambitious BRI since it was launched by President Xi Jinping in 2013. These include, for example, a lack of transparency around Chinese lending, corruption, unsustainable debt, adverse environmental and social impacts, and projects with dual-use potential. The Biden administration has framed the initiative as a response to BRI, noting in the first line of its fact sheet: “Today President Biden met with G7 leaders to discuss strategic competition with China and commit to concrete actions to help meet the tremendous infrastructure need in low- and middle-income countries.” Unmet global needs are another primary driver. China’s BRI has significantly pulled back in recent years, underscoring Beijing’s challenges in managing the endeavor and presenting an opportunity for G7 countries to offer competing alternatives. To be sure, China’s BRI was never as big as sometimes portrayed, reaching into the hundreds of billions rather than trillions of dollars. A lack of transparency, and the absence of official criteria for projects, makes it difficult to track the BRI with precision. But the overall trend is clear: as the list of countries participating in the BRI has ballooned, the resources being made available to those countries have plummeted. The Covid-19 pandemic has further increased needs in the developing world while reducing the ability of many countries to borrow. Although competing alternatives to the BRI are gaining new momentum, they have struggled to deliver tangible projects. As host of the Group of 20 (G20) in 2019, Japan won endorsement by G20 leaders (including Xi Jinping) to a set of principles for quality infrastructure investment. The same year, Japan and the European Union announced a “Partnership on Sustainable Connectivity and Quality Infrastructure.” This January, the European Parliament adopted a resolution that calls for creating a global EU Connectivity Strategy as an extension of the current EU-Asia Connectivity Strategy. Attending this year’s G7 summit as an observer, India announced the Asia Africa Growth Corridor with Japan in 2017 and is discussing a joint initiative with the European Union. For its part, the United States has gradually realized the importance of offering positive alternatives. In late 2019, United States, Japan, and Australia announced the “ Blue Dot Network” (BDN) to help operationalize the G20 principles. The effort has received encouraging interest from the private sector and civil society, but it is still developing criteria for certifying projects that meet high standards. The B3W could add urgency to announce pilot projects and work toward expanding the BDN to include European partners. The B3W’s global scope could allow partners to focus on different functional and geographic areas in line with their capabilities and interests. European partners, for example, are increasingly active in the Western Balkans, where Chinese projects have raised red flags in several EU-candidate countries. Japan has been active in Southeast Asia, where it remains the incumbent provider of infrastructure projects. U.S. involvement is likely to emphasize the Indo-Pacific, which will also help respond to criticism that the Biden administration, which has resisted the idea of rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership or other regional trade agreements, lacks a credible economic strategy in the region. Q2: Why the focus on mobilizing private capital? A2: Global demands for infrastructure cannot be met by public capital alone. During 2015-19, G7 countries provided nearly $113 billion in official development assistance for foreign infrastructure projects, as illustrated below. That support is fundamentally different from most of China’s BRI lending, which comes with higher interest rates and does not adhere to the Paris Club principles. While remaining steady as China’s BRI has declined, the G7’s combined assistance is only a fraction of what the developing world needs. Developing Asia alone will require $26 trillion in infrastructure investment through 2030, according to the Asian Development Bank. The private sector is where the untapped financial firepower resides. Pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds are all looking for reliable, long-term returns. Wealth and money managers now handle over $110 trillion, more than 16 times the U.S. federal budget in 2020. But only a small fraction of this vast amount is invested in infrastructure, and developing economies, in particular, have appeared too risky for many investors. According to World Bank data, during 2015-19, private sector investors in G7 countries put roughly $22 billion toward infrastructure projects in developing countries. For example, if G7 countries realized the International Finance Corporation’s mobilization target of 80 percent, current levels of assistance would unlock more than $200 billion over five years. This will require designing incentives that shift investors’ risk-reward calculus. As the CSIS Global Infrastructure Task Force noted: Q3: What will the U.S. government need to do to make B3W a viable alternative to the BRI? A3: The United States and its partners need to invest in a system for developing a sustainable pipeline of bankable projects. Sharing information and improving coordination between public and private sector stakeholders, as the G20’s Global Infrastructure Hub was created to do, is necessary but not sufficient. Preparing projects will require putting some public money on the table. In developing countries, project preparation expenses often approach five to ten percent of the total project cost. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development’s Project Preparation Facility is one promising model to consider. The United States should continue to support capacity-building efforts as well. Providing transaction assistance bilaterally and through multilateral institutions can help developing countries avoid unusual confidentiality clauses, inflated costs, and other risks. Modest investments in these activities can have outsized outcomes, which will help countries negotiate for better financial and legal terms that meet accepted international standards. For example, helping more countries implement life-cycle cost assessments will also enhance the competitiveness of the B3W offers. The B3W needs to resonate with leaders in developing countries. Many will be eager to expand their options, and the B3W brand could carry prestige as a high-quality effort. But leaders will be cautious about tradeoffs that B3W projects might present—more public scrutiny, higher up-front costs, and longer timelines for project delivery. Competing against China’s approach, which often promises speed and low up-front costs, will require fashioning effective incentives. Finally, the U.S. government needs a central coordinator for these efforts. The list of U.S. agencies with relevant expertise and capabilities is long, including not only State, Treasury, Commerce, and the U.S. Agency for International Development, but also Defense, Homeland Security, Transportation, and smaller specialized agencies, such as the U.S. Development Finance Corporation, the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and the Trade and Development Agency, among others. President Biden’s making the B3W a priority provides an opportunity to more effectively harness these capabilities. Matthew P.

This report is adapted from testimony submitted to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission’s postponed hearing on “A ‘China Model?’ Beijing’s Promotion of Alternative Global Norms and Standards.” The full version of this testimony can be found on the commission’s website here. Does China seek an alternative global order? What would this order would look like and aim to achieve? How does Beijing see its future role differing from the role the United States enjoys today? What impact does the Communist Party of China’s (CCP) ideology and its invocation of “Chinese culture” play when talking about its ambitions to lead the reform of global governance?1 This essay will address these questions by dissecting the meaning of the “new era for socialism with Chinese characteristics” that Xi Jinping proclaimed at the CCP’s 19th National Congress (afterwards “19th Party Congress”) in October 2017. Why should we focus on this specific speech? In China’s Leninist-style political system, the report delivered by the incumbent general secretary at a Party Congress once every five years—the same venue selects a new Central Committee, Politburo, Politburo Standing Committee, and the leaders of other high-level party organs—constitutes the most authoritative statement of the party’s aims. It begins by assessing China’s progress in the past five years (or the full tenure in office of the incumbent general secretary if he is stepping down at the Party Congress). Then it evaluates the internal and external environment China faces, adjusts the party’s guiding ideology in light of new conditions, and lays out goals, not only for the next five years, but frequently also much longer-term objectives which are further clarified and adjusted over time. Finally, the report addresses the party’s strategy in nine major policy areas.2 It is an understatement to say that Xi’s report to the 19th Party Congress was more dramatic than most. As China approached an interim set of development targets for 2020 in the “three-step strategic plan for modernization” it has been implementing since 1987, Xi not only moved targets originally expressed for mid-century forward by 15 years to 2035 but also expressed new mid-century goals.3 These included China becoming “a global leader in terms of composite national strength and international influence.”4 Xi further identified China’s recent emergence as the number two economy in the world as a milestone in what he described as the party’s consistent ambition over the course of its rule to “rejuvenate the Chinese nation.”5 He described China as “moving closer to the center of the world stage.”6 In the same speech, Xi further argued that socialism with Chinese characteristics was “blazing a new trail” for other developing countries seeking to modernize and preserve their sovereignty.7 Xi’s address came at a time when the discussion about China here in Washington was already darkening, and yet his words undoubtedly contributed to what many have described as a changed conversation about the U.S.-China strategic rivalry.8 Nevertheless, in the almost two years since Xi’s speech, there has not been a clear explication in English of several key themes that should have both clarified our understanding of Beijing’s ambitions for the global order and caused professional observers of China to reexamine paradigms that have dominated our discussions for decades.9 This essay will argue that, placed in its proper context, Xi’s report should have decisively ended our debate about the nature and scope of Beijing’s strategic intentions. In one of the speech’s most important passages Xi proclaimed: Chinese socialism’s entrance into a new era is, in the history of the development of the People’s Republic of China and the history of the development of the Chinese nation, of tremendous importance. In the history of the development of international socialism and the history of the development of human society, it is of tremendous importance.10 This essay will briefly address what Xi’s speech tells us about the CCP’s strategy and its ambitions for the global order with respect to each of the three areas he identifies: (1) development designed to change the status of the Chinese nation in the world as the primary aim of the party-state, (2) the role of socialism in the party’s strategy, and (3) the party’s desire to make a specifically Chinese contribution to the future of humanity as a whole (or, in another phrase of Xi’s report, to “keep contributing Chinese wisdom and strength to global governance”).11 I. Developing China into a Global Leader as the Party’s Consistent Aim For decades, especially in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union, external observers have characterized the CCP’s primary aim as simply to stay in power.12 The dominant research program in China studies across several academic disciplines is best described as a “problems-based” agenda. It sees the party’s rule as lurching from crisis to crisis as a result of adopting what historian John W. Garver calls “a deeply dysfunctional political-economic system” from the Soviet Union and discarding the economic system after Mao’s death but retaining the political system, which in this view is not well-equipped to cope with the massive economic and social changes unleashed by market reforms.13 This has produced an image of China’s leaders as besieged and reactive, seeking only to keep economic development going to smooth over a boiling cauldron of domestic problems. China studies has tended to ask: “What are China’s governance problems and how is the party trying and failing to cope with them?” A corollary has further identified China’s foreign policy as driven by these same domestic imperatives of preserving economic growth and political stability. My reading of the party’s history—in particular, its post-Mao history—suggests exactly the opposite of the incumbent scholarly view. Rather than reactive, defensive, and besieged, the party’s pursuit of modernity, power, and international status for China has been strategic, active, and purposeful. One of the most striking features of Xi’s 19th Party Congress address is its combination of articulating China’s ambitions on an explicitly global scale (a dramatic departure from recent decades) with an assertion of the continuity of the party’s goals throughout its rule. Xi uses long sections of the speech to reframe his signature formulation “the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation” as the party’s “original aspiration” and “mission.”14 In a nutshell, to read Xi in the context of the speeches of Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and their successors—whose language Xi’s is meant to invoke—is to realize that Beijing’s aim is nothing less than preeminent status within the global order. The party’s consistent focus has been to transform China into a modern, powerful socialist country that delivers a leadership position in the world commensurate with China’s endowments of people, land, and past cultural triumphs.15 Xi (and his predecessors) have continuously underlined the continuity of their goal of developing China to the point where it can, in Mao’s words (language Xi self-consciously echoes), “stand tall in the forest of nations.”16 “National rejuvenation” is an effective political slogan precisely because it represents the common denominator aspiration of Chinese elites since the country’s humiliation in the mid-nineteenth century Opium Wars.17 This aspiration is to transform China into not only a modern, powerful country but also a country respected for its achievements across all fields of human endeavor by which great powers measure themselves, from prosperity to military power to cultural influence to scientific discovery.18 Equally crucial, both Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping identified the goal not merely to “catch-up” with “the most advanced countries” but to surpass them.19 The party’s past strategy documents and leadership speeches underscore that it has been pursuing comprehensive modernity for decades via a state-led process of identifying longterm targets, embedding them in plans, making investments, and adjusting and elaborating on targets as it proceeds.20 Under Mao, horrific policy experiments caused millions of deaths, but the party’s leaders today claim credit for taking China from poverty and backwardness to the number two economy (and implicitly, power) in the world in four decades.21 It is surprising that while most observers of China in the West would acknowledge that the party seeks to make the country modern and strong, scholarship in English has largely ignored the party, state, and military target-setting and long-term planning processes. Otherwise excellent textbooks on Chinese politics explore the challenges of day-to-day governance and of crisis response, the mechanisms of domestic control, and the party’s political succession processes but have not provided students and U.S. government officials with a sense of the strategic agency of the party’s leaders.22 This neglect may reflect mirror imaging. Our political system is not designed to take the United States in a specific direction. If anything, it was designed to prevent political whims of the moment from leading to tyranny. For Beijing, by contrast, the purpose of politics is to serve the nationalist project of comprehensively modernizing and developing China. It is about time we paid attention to the ideas and institutional processes that drive this effort. We need an “ends-based” research program on China that studies how Beijing conceives of great power competition in multiple domains, unpacks the theories, targets, and strategies it is adopting, and then evaluates their progress and prospects.23 Here, the central premise of Xi’s address to the 19th Party Congress is that China’s emergence as the number two power requires an integrated set of new domestic and foreign policies for the new set of challenges Beijing faces as it completes its ascent over the next three decades.24 What Xi’s “new era” means is that China is at the threshold—to be crossed in the next three decades—of realizing national rejuvenation. For the party, while China remains a developing country on a per capita basis, as a whole it is catching up with the most advanced countries in many fields. Further, today’s economic, technological, and military competitions offer a rare opportunity to seize the initiative and to participate in setting international norms in emerging domains such as cyber, space, artificial intelligence, the deep oceans, and the arctic, among others.25 We need an “ends-based” research program on China that studies how Beijing conceives of great power competition in multiple domains, unpacks the theories, targets, and strategies it is adopting, and then evaluates their progress and prospects. What, then, does the party’s desire to assume the leading place in the global order mean for Washington?26 The answer depends on whether Beijing intends to refashion the order and change its fundamental values in ways the United States cannot tolerate. Indeed, for the last several decades, some U.S. theorists of international relations and some U.S. policymakers have explicitly advocated a strategy of both seeking to strengthen the current order and binding China to it as it rises so that, even if the United States experiences relative decline, the nature of the order is preserved.27 Others have argued that the changes Beijing desires do not relate to the order’s most important features and that the threat is primarily to U.S. pride (i.e., Washington’s ability to adjust to a loss of status).28 Still oth",2013-2017,9,high_conflict
107,2015,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/its-debt-trap-managing-china-imf-cooperation-across-belt-and-road,en,"It’s a (Debt) Trap! Managing China-IMF Cooperation Across the Belt and Road Available Downloads Five years ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced his flagship foreign policy project, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Currently, total Chinese BRI investment is estimated at over $1 trillion, more than eight-times the size of the Marshall Plan in today’s dollars. When it was launched, China heralded BRI as a “golden opportunity” to “revitalize” the region. Today, many countries are wary about China’s intentions. Unlike the Marshall Plan, which mainly dispersed aid in the form of grants that did not have to be repaid, China uses loans that often come at commercial interest rates. While the BRI provides vital infrastructure funding to developing countries, it also leaves many with unsustainable debt. For example, China is funding a high-speed rail line in Laos that will cost equivalent to half the country’s GDP. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), China, and other stakeholders should cooperate to help countries along the Belt and Road facing financial imbalances and high debt. This will not be easy. Before providing aid, the IMF will require transparency into BRI loan terms, which are notoriously opaque and can burden countries with high debt. China has resisted international involvement in BRI, yet the foundation for cooperation already exists. To reconcile these competing perspectives, the IMF and China should expand communication channels and launch pilot reforms that address problems on both sides. If these conditions are met, the United States should encourage IMF assistance to BRI countries to protect sovereignty and promote higher lending standards. BRI spending in developing countries has raised serious concerns about debt sustainability. A recent Center for Global Development report found eight BRI recipient countries—Djibouti, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, the Maldives, Mongolia, Montenegro, Pakistan, and Tajikistan—are at a high risk of debt distress due to BRI loans. These countries will all face rising debt-to-GDP ratios beyond 50 percent, with at least 40 percent of external debt owed to China once BRI lending is complete. These countries will need support to service BRI loans as repayments peak and will likely turn to the IMF and other smaller lenders. Discussions for an IMF bailout have already begun in Pakistan, where China has invested $62 billion, or one-fifth of Pakistan’s GDP, in infrastructure and energy projects. The IMF has scrutinized multiple aspects of the BRI, repeatedly warning of unsustainable debt levels, predatory lending, and the lack of project transparency. To assuage these concerns, the IMF will request greater clarity on foreign currency payments, including the details of BRI loans, before authorizing a credit line. An IMF program should include BRI debt restructuring or reevaluating proposed infrastructure investments to determine if they are financially sound. At a minimum, the IMF will need to see the terms of BRI loans to complete the necessary debt sustainability analysis. Given these constraints, there is a possibility for disagreement between the IMF and China over the future of BRI projects in debt-distressed countries. Chinese loans violate several international lending best practices involving procurement, transparency, and dispute settlement. Chinese contractors dominate infrastructure projects, and Chinese-funded loans are less transparent than those from multilateral development banks. Beijing has demonstrated a reluctance to abide by international investment standards, establishing two courts to resolve BRI-related disputes outside of existing settlement venues. China also enshrined BRI into its constitution last year, putting pressure on state companies and officials to continue lending. Working with the international community would help China further reduce risky loans and ensure sustainable return on investment. However, China is now publicly recognizing the need to reform BRI lending terms to address international and domestic concerns. In the wake of Malaysia’s decision to cancel two large Chinese-funded projects, Beijing launched a publicity blitz to defend the BRI. Deputy Chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission Ning Jizhe said China should be “objective and rational” when addressing debt concerns and work to facilitate international cooperation. Beijing has also agreed to open investment in BRI projects in Pakistan to foreign companies, although it did not name any specific partners that would be joining.13 At home, President Xi has prioritized fighting China’s “three tough battles” of limiting financing risk, reducing poverty, and curbing pollution. As part of this effort, Beijing has pulled back on profligate BRI spending, signing 6 percent fewer contracts in the first five months of 2018 than during the same period in 2017. Working with the international community would help China further reduce risky loans and ensure sustainable return on investment. Beijing can demonstrate its commitment to addressing concerns about the BRI by partnering with the IMF to improve lending practices. The two sides have already improved communication and expertise sharing this year. In April, the IMF announced the opening of the Chinese funded China-IMF Capacity Development Center to help train development officials and support the BRI. China also unveiled its International Development Cooperation Agency in April in an effort to put BRI decisionmaking under a single agency, a decision the IMF applauded. The next steps will be to deepen these channels and launch targeted pilot reforms to boost confidence on both sides. A successful program for both sides could set the stage for broader changes. A model for serious reforms palatable to Beijing can be found within one of China’s own initiatives, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The Beijing-led development bank was launched in 2015 and, despite some initial skepticism, the organization’s operating procedures follow international standards. A majority of its projects are co-funded with Western-backed institutions and have clear documentation. In April 2017, the AIIB announced a memorandum of understanding with the World Bank to deepen cooperation, a framework that China can apply to discussions with the IMF on debt relief.20 Adopting these reforms will help legitimize the BRI and ease some of the economic tension between China and the United States. Under the current circumstances, U.S. concerns about IMF assistance being used to bail out Chinese creditors are valid. However, if Beijing commits to cleaning up its act, Washington should encourage IMF involvement in BRI countries. In doing so, the United States can encourage vital investment in developing countries while working through the IMF to encourage China to improve investment standards. At a minimum, the IMF process will improve the transparency of projects and put countries on a path to debt sustainability. More importantly, it will reduce the risk that recipient countries forfeit strategically important assets in return for Chinese debt forgiveness. Without the IMF, countries facing financial distress from BRI loans will have limited options for support outside of China and will fall deeper into debt.

Introduction A Brief History of Japan’s Official Development Assistance Since the end of the Cold War, dramatic changes in the security environment in the Indo-Pacific region have transformed Japan’s official development assistance (ODA) strategy, as evidenced by revisions to the ODA Development Cooperation Charter. This paper examines the evolution of Japan’s development cooperation in recent years in response to international factors, the results of those development efforts, and potential policies to be considered in the future. Japan entered the field of development cooperation when it joined the Colombo Plan in 1954. It then experienced an extended period of rapid economic growth. The scale of its ODA continued to expand, and by 1989 it had surpassed the United States to become the world’s top donor in terms of volume. After World War II, Japan branded itself as a peaceful nation and imposed strict restrictions on the use of military force, including prohibitions on military aid to other countries. The Japanese government also avoided providing assistance that could be perceived as interfering in the internal affairs of recipient countries or making political conditionalities for development assistance, such as maintaining a liberal democracy or respect for human rights. After the Cold War, however, issues emerged for Japan’s ODA, such as support for the democratization of former socialist countries or for state building in fragile states. In April 1991, Japan introduced four guidelines that officials should consider when making decisions about ODA: (1) trends in military expenditures; (2) trends in the development and manufacture of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and missiles; (3) trends in arms imports and exports; and (4) efforts to promote democratization, introduce a market-oriented economy, and guarantee basic human rights and freedoms. The four ODA guidelines reflect Japan’s first use of the political conditionality principle and were incorporated into the first ODA charter, approved by the government on June 30, 1992. Shortly thereafter, Japan’s economy collapsed and entered a prolonged slump, placing a severe strain on government finances. In 1997, the government shifted its emphasis from quantity to quality in ODA and reduced the budget; in 2001, Japan lost its status as the world’s top donor. This financial situation led to a decline in public support for ODA, and in an attempt to demonstrate accountability to taxpayers, the government released a revised ODA charter in August 2003 emphasizing that ODA would be clearly connected to the national interest. Japan’s ODA in the Indo-Pacific An increasingly complex security environment in Asia over the last decade has affected Japan’s approach to ODA strategy. China’s maritime aggression in the East and South China Seas has prompted a renewed focus on the rule of law as a core principle in the securitization of ODA, meaning more openness to supporting capacity building in the security realm. Japan became wary of China’s coercive tactics in the mid-2000s, ahead of the West. Since Chinese president Xi Jinping took office in 2013, China has not only attempted to unilaterally change the status quo by force in the East China Sea (Senkaku Islands) and the South China Sea (Paracel Islands and Spratly Islands) but has also sought to enhance its influence in Pacific Island nations, exemplified by a security agreement with the Solomon Islands announced in 2022. China has also increased development aid to expand its footprint across the region. In 2010, for example, China surpassed Japan to become the top aid donor to Cambodia. China has also adopted a multilateral approach to aid via the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)—originally called the One Belt, One Road Initiative—announced in 2013; the establishment of the New Development Bank (NDB) with the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) in 2014; and the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in 2016. These new multilateral aid institutions are expected to challenge the existing development cooperation architecture dominated by developed countries. Faced with an increasingly assertive China committed to challenging norms across the security and diplomatic realms, Japan, under the leadership of Prime Minister Abe Shinzo, unveiled its first National Security Strategy (NSS) in December 2013, which detailed how Japan would manage in an increasingly complex security environment. The NSS was significant in that it was not limited to foreign and defense policy but clearly stated that ODA should be part of Japan’s security policy. The NSS built on the revised ODA charter of 2003 by: (1) emphasizing the national interest; (2) adding the rule of law to a list of universal values including freedom, democracy, and fundamental human rights; (3) addressing development issues not only through ODA but also by mobilizing various government resources; and (4) flexibly applying the principle of non-military assistance in order to facilitate military capacity building for like-minded developing states. The government then released a Development Cooperation Charter in 2015 to reflect these new realities. Moreover, in response to China’s massive infrastructure development initiative, the Abe administration launched the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) vision in 2016, with the main goal of countering China’s rise. China’s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific has since intensified, as has Japan’s commitment to preserving the international order after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, which has threatened the rule of law, upended global supply chains, and exacerbated economic strife and poverty in developing countries. In December 2022, Japanese prime minister Kishida Fumio accelerated the securitization of ODA in a new NSS, which noted, “Japan will strategically utilize ODA to maintain and develop a free and open international order and to realize coexistence and coprosperity in the international community.” Following the revision of the NSS, the Development Cooperation Charter was also revised in June 2023 to declare “Japan’s national interests” as the core objective of ODA, with particular emphasis on security and multilateralism. The new charter declared that the purpose of development cooperation is “to contribute even more actively to the formation of a peaceful, stable, and prosperous international society” and at the same time “contribute to the realization of Japan’s national interests, such as securing peace and security for Japan and its people and achieving further prosperity through economic growth.” This was the first time that the “realization of Japan’s national interests” was explicitly stated as one of the direct objectives of development cooperation. New priorities for development cooperation emerged in parallel with a new version of the FOIP vision Kishida released in March 2023, dubbed the New Plan for a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP).” According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this plan is based on the following four pillars of cooperation: - Principles of Peace and Rules for Prosperity: (1) Reaffirm and promote the minimum basic principles the international community should observe (sovereignty, respect for territorial integrity, and opposition to unilateral changes in the status quo by force) to build international peace, and (2) create rules to prevent opaque and unfair development finance. - High-Quality Infrastructure: Encourage Japanese companies to expand overseas and revitalize both the local and Japanese economies.[1] - Multilayered Connectivity: Enhance connectivity in various realms to enable growth, as reliance on any single country can increase risk or lead to political fragility. - Efforts to Expand Security from Sea to Air: Cooperate, emphasize, and communicate with other countries and regional organizations that share the principles of FOIP, and promote the sharing of principles and knowledge to ensure the rule of law at sea. The Kishida government also worked closely with the United States and other like-minded nations to introduce a range of initiatives reaffirming shared commitment to the global order, including support for the developing world. In May 2023, Kishida hosted the Hiroshima G7 summit, which produced a Leaders’ Communiqué including international principles and common values such as the rule of law, an initiative on global food security, and a commitment of up to $600 billion in financing for quality infrastructure development through the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure Investment (PGII). Prime Minister Kishida also explained his New Plan for a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific,” emphasizing support for the Global South, and G7 leaders agreed to help realize the FOIP vision. Key Issues: Results of Japanese Strategies and Policies This section examines the effectiveness and impact of Japan’s development aid policies in the context of strategic competition with China. Components of FOIP FOIP may be described as an umbrella concept that incorporates numerous components such as norms, rule setting, infrastructure development, and capacity building. The first component is an emphasis on universal values, such as the rule of law. The first Abe administration (2006–07) introduced a concept known as the Arc of Freedom and Prosperity to defend liberal democracy in the region spanning from Asia to Europe and prevent the rise of authoritarianism, with China in mind. However, some Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member countries, concerned about interference in their internal affairs, negatively evaluated this initiative, which failed to generate regional support for global norms as a result. Therefore, Japan’s focus on promoting universal values shifted from liberal democracy to broader principles such as the rule of law and freedom of navigation. To be sure, the original FOIP and Kishida’s New Plan refer to democratization and human rights. However, the 2023 revision of the Development Cooperation Charter, while paying sufficient attention to democratization, rule of law, and human rights conditions, states that development cooperation will be implemented based on comprehensive assessment of a partner country’s development needs, economic and social conditions, bilateral relations, and efforts to improve governance and democratization by partner governments’ initiatives. In other words, compliance with universal values is neither a condition for aid nor an excuse for interference in internal affairs. Even in the FOIP era, Japanese assistance has not changed significantly from previous policies in terms of its approach to political conditionality. This universalization with a rather narrowly focused emphasis on rule of law is an essential agenda-setting mechanism for expanding support for FOIP among like-minded countries. Thus, both the West and emerging and developing countries have widely supported and endorsed the normative aspects of FOIP. The second component of FOIP focuses on international rulemaking and reaffirmation of global norms. This theme featured in former prime minister Abe’s foreign policy prior to FOIP. For example, Abe delivered the keynote speech at the 2014 Shangri-La Dialogue, attended by defense and security ministers from Asia-Pacific countries, and stressed principles related to the rule of law in the context of Chinese assertiveness over its maritime sovereignty claims in the region. Japan also accentuated rules and norms related to infrastructure development in response to worsening debt sustainability associated with massive ",2013-2017,24,high_conflict
109,2015,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/predatory-economics-and-china-challenge,en,"“We need to collaborate with India to ensure that the Indo-Pacific...does not become a region of disorder, conflict, and predatory economics.” This was the heart of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s high-profile speech on U.S.-India relations, delivered at CSIS on October 18. The last two words of this sentence, a none-too-subtle reference to mercantilist economic policies by China, raised eyebrows. To be sure, the phrase contained some truth, but it likely grated on many ears in Asia and could be counterproductive if the United States does not offer its own, more positive vision for economic integration of that vital region. Tillerson was right that many of China’s trade and investment practices are problematic—and becoming more so as the country takes a more assertive turn under President Xi Jinping. Most blatant is Beijing’s use of economic coercion to achieve its diplomatic objectives. It cut off tourist and retail trade with South Korea earlier this year after Seoul installed the U.S.-built Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile-defense system. When the previous government in Manila defied China’s maritime claims in the South China Sea, Beijing effectively embargoed Philippine bananas. And Norwegian salmon exports fell victim to Beijing’s displeasure at Oslo’s awarding the Nobel Prize to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo in 2010. At the same time, China’s trading partners have a growing bill of particulars about Beijing’s mercantilist practices. These include widespread market-access restrictions, from equity caps on investment to regulatory harassment; pervasive subsidies directed at national champions that tilt the competitive playing field against foreign firms in China and in third markets; and widespread forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft. Moreover, U.S. businesses and national security experts alike fear that these self-serving practices will persist: the “Made in China 2025” plan makes explicit Beijing’s ambitions to dominate key industries of the future such as robotics, aerospace, and advanced biotechnology. Secretary of State Tillerson highlighted another area of concern when he answered CSIS president John Hamre’s first question after his speech, about the meaning of “predatory economics.” Tillerson cited financing schemes for large infrastructure projects that saddle recipient countries with unsustainable debt and could even compromise their sovereignty. He said the United States is having a quiet conversation with other countries about alternative financing mechanisms. President Donald Trump echoed these points in his speech earlier this month in Danang, Vietnam, calling on the World Bank and Asian Development Bank to focus on high-quality infrastructure investment and suggesting that U.S. development institutions such as the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) might offer new alternatives to Chinese-tied finance. These efforts could be constructive. But the Trump administration needs to be careful not to cast all of China’s economic behavior as “predatory.” Asian countries want access to the large Chinese market, and increasingly they want Chinese technology and capital—including to support infrastructure development. Xi Jinping’s signature “Belt and Road Initiative” is broadly welcome in the region, and Washington should not give the impression that it opposes Beijing’s efforts—a mistake the Obama administration made in 2015 when it tried to rally support against the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). To be sure, the United States should brush China back when it violates the letter or spirit of the rules-based economic order. We should call out Beijing when it uses economic coercion to force its will on smaller countries. Using U.S. trade laws and World Trade Organization (WTO) procedures to challenge illegal Chinese subsidies or forced technology transfer policies is vital to protecting our economic interests and to defending an order that has served both countries well. Of course we need to do all this in a way that does not cause more damage to the order, as the Trump administration’s unilateral and protectionist language worryingly suggests it might. It is also worth asking what role U.S. private-sector participants can play in protecting the rules-based system. China’s systematic efforts to acquire strategic technologies from the United States and its allies have also been portrayed as a form of “predatory economics.” Again, there are legitimate concerns here, not only for our national security but also for our economic competitiveness where Beijing tilts the playing field in its favor. Certainly we need to “protect the crown jewels”: among other things, Washington should ensure that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has the resources and analytic capacity to screen out Chinese investments that genuinely threaten national security. The bipartisan bill tabled this month by Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) and others is an attempt to address these concerns but runs the risk of producing too prescriptive a process and having a chilling effect on legitimate inbound foreign investment. Moreover, we cannot only play defense. There are two critical things we need to do on offense. First, we need a positive economic agenda that extends our decades-long work on promoting growth around the world, opening markets, and creating high-standard rules of the road. Secretary Tillerson, and later President Trump in his speech in Vietnam, was on the right track in calling for a “free and open Indo-Pacific.” But the president gave away the most powerful tool we had for moving that objective forward, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and replaced it not with a credible regional trade strategy but merely with criticism of trading partners—including key strategic allies—for “unfair” practices that feed bilateral trade imbalances. This was accompanied by tough-sounding but nonspecific talk of negotiating one-sided bilateral agreements that no self-interested Asian country would agree to. (For a more constructive U.S. agenda in the region, see the report issued by CSIS last month, updating our Asia Economic Strategy Commission report earlier in the year.) The other essential task for the United States is to invest in ourselves. Without updating our sagging domestic infrastructure, retooling our education system and training programs for the twenty-first century economy, and promoting research and development in industries of the future, we stand little chance of competing with a China that is making a concerted effort to do all of those things. And foreign policy experts like those of us at CSIS can no longer get away with leaving those questions to the domestic policy community; they are the essential foundations of popular support for U.S. international engagement, and we need to have something to say about them. All four of the strands of a successful U.S. response to the China challenge that I have mentioned—holding Beijing to account, protecting the crown jewels, adopting a positive economic agenda, and investing in ourselves—will only succeed if we coordinate closely with like-minded allies and partners. The United States has neither the scope of vision nor adequate leverage to take on China alone. We need help from our North American, European, and Asian partners in filing joint WTO cases, sharing information about China’s strategic technology acquisitions, working together toward multilateral rules on infrastructure finance—and even investing in our domestic infrastructure. In 1967, the French intellectual Jean-Jacques Serban-Schreiber published Le Défi Americain (“The American Challenge”), a seminal work warning of the threat to Europe’s economic and cultural prowess from pervasive American technology and ideas. Servan-Schreiber did not accuse Americans of “predatory” behavior or advocate pulling up the drawbridge to protect fortress Europe; rather, he called on Europeans to learn from Americans and to join forces with each other to meet the challenge. There are lessons here for the United States today as we confront “le défi chinois.” In asserting on his recent Asian trip that, “I don’t blame China,” President Trump went too far in absolving Beijing of responsibility for mercantilist actions that undermine the global economic order. Moreover, his proposed unilateral and protectionist solutions are misguided and harmful to U.S. interests. But in one respect he is right to put “America first”: without our own coherent international economic strategy, built on strong domestic foundations, we stand little chance of rising to today’s China challenge.

110,2015,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/quadrilateral-security-dialogue-and-maritime-silk-road-initiative,en,"The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue and the Maritime Silk Road Initiative The Issue: - Major geopolitical shifts in the Asia-Pacific in the last decade have led to a revitalization of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue between India, Japan, Australia, and the United States first established in 2007-2008. - China’s expanding maritime strategy and increasing assertiveness in land reclamation and territorial claims have been a key driver of a strengthening alignment among the Quad members. - China’s Maritime Silk Road Initiative (MSRI) offers unique concerns to each member: - India fears encroachment on its zone of strategic interest as well as encirclement from Chinese projects in Pakistan. - Japan is wary of China’s ability to influence the energy supply chains on which East Asia depends. - Australia is concerned by Chinese interference in domestic politics and higher education. - The United States is seeking a way to counteract Chinese influence, particularly in the vacuum left by U.S. withdrawal from the TPP. - While an official meeting of the Quad in November 2017 included key issues like freedom of navigation, maritime security, and respect for international law, official readouts of the meeting differed, suggesting that strategic geography, threat perceptions, and dynamics vis-à-vis China vary among the parties. - Notwithstanding these challenges, the interests of the Quad countries are converging, and this underlying structural dynamic provides a strong foundation on which the member countries can build an agenda for regional cooperation. On the sidelines of the November 2017 East Asia Summit in Manila, the Philippines, officials from the United States, Japan, India, and Australia met to reestablish and re-conceptualize the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (or Quad). These states originally came together as the “Core Group” to provide urgent humanitarian assistance in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami disaster. They then met formally just once as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue in 2007 before newly elected Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd directed Foreign Minister Stephen Smith to withdraw from the nascent dialogue. Attempts by subsequent Australian governments to build strategic trust with India and repair the damage to the emerging Australia-India security relationship were often rebuffed. The reestablishment of the Quad a decade later points to tectonic shifts in the geopolitics of the region and in the Asia policies of the members of the original Quad. Having resigned suddenly in 2007 after only a year in office, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe—a consistent proponent of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” strategic concept—has mounted a highly successful return to office since 2012 and has emerged as a key leadership figure in the region. The Obama administration announced the U.S. “Rebalance to Asia”, and the Trump administration has officially labeled China as a strategic competitor to the United States. Ambivalence in India about closer strategic ties with the United States under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has been replaced under his successor Narendra Modi by a commitment to strengthen the U.S.-India security relationship as pressure over China’s influence in the Indian Ocean region increased. In Australia revelations of Chinese interference in domestic politics and higher education and Beijing’s increasing international assertiveness have triggered increasing public concern and more forthright government moves to counteract growing Chinese influence in the region—including by rejoining the Quad. China’s expanding maritime strategy and the increasing assertiveness of its land reclamation and territorial claims in disputed areas in the South and East China Seas over the past decade have been a key driver of this strengthening alignment among the Quad members. Undaunted by the international arbitration judgment invalidating many of Beijing’s legal claims in the South China Sea or by international pushback, President Xi Jinping has outlined an ambitious regional maritime agenda, encouraging Southeast Asian states to assist China in building a twenty-first-century Maritime Silk Road (MSR) to complement an overland Silk Road to be built with Central Asian partners. Additionally, the Chinese Military Strategy White Paper, released in May 2015, declared that the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) would “gradually shift its focus from ‘offshore waters defense’ to the combination of ‘offshore waters defense’ with ‘open seas protection,’” requiring enhanced power-projection capabilities already evident in increasing patrols of the Indian Ocean by PLAN surface task groups and submarines. As with the overland Silk Road, establishing the Maritime Silk Road involves significant investments in both economic and security-related infrastructure around the Indian Ocean littoral, including in countries such as Burma, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and Djibouti. Often these activities involve predatory lending practices that feed corruption and domestic political and social divisions, contributing to wider regional concerns about China’s long-term intentions. The revival of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue needs to be understood in this wider geopolitical context. India The Modi government’s opposition to the Maritime Silk Road Initiative reflects two interlocking concerns. The first is that it perceives the MSRI as a means to extend Beijing’s strategic influence deep into India’s zone of strategic interest. Reinforcing India’s concern are the efforts of the Chinese government to partner with regional institutions over which China exerts significant influence. The second concern relates to India’s tense relationship with Pakistan. New Delhi views both aspects of the Silk Road Initiative—the maritime and overland routes—as attempts to “encircle” India. Compounding this concern is the Chinese development of the Gwadar Port, a deep-sea port in the Southwest Balochistan Province of Pakistan. Close to the critical energy lanes from the Persian Gulf and the hydrocarbon-rich states of Central Asia, Gwadar is intended to form a natural link between the overland and maritime components of the Chinese Belt and Road strategy. In addition, elements of the overland Silk Road pass through disputed territory in the Kashmir region—leading to Indian reservations on the grounds of perceived threats to sovereignty and territorial integrity. Although Gwadar is touted as a commercial project (as indeed are all the investments connected to the Belt and Road initiative), the increasing Chinese military presence in the Indian Ocean raises questions about this assertion. Japan Japan’s concerns about the MSR initiative relate mostly to the risk it could be employed to limit or block energy shipments to East Asia. Japan imports some 90 percent of its energy, leaving it highly vulnerable to supply-chain disruption. As noted above, the Gwadar Port project is intended to function as a link between the continental and maritime strands of the Belt and Road strategy. China has already shown preparedness to exploit Japan’s dependence on imported rare earths in pursuit of its political objectives. This precedent suggests it is not implausible that Beijing could seek at some point in the future to play to Japan’s energy insecurity by routing a larger proportion of energy supplies through the Gwadar Port, ultimately to be stored or resold by China, limiting the amount of energy that passes through the Strait of Malacca. Japan’s sensitivity to this vulnerability can be seen in the comments of former Vice Foreign Minister Akitaka Saiki that Japan sees no difference regarding security issues in the Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, South China Sea, or East China Sea. It is also a factor in Japan’s active effort to maintain and diversify its access to facilities and resources, such as its partnership with India to create the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor, which aims to promote development and connectivity between Africa and Asia for “realizing a free and open Indo-Pacific.” Indeed, at the 2016 Tokyo International Conference on African Development in Nairobi, Kenya, Prime Minister Abe stated, “Japan bears the responsibility of fostering the confluence of the Pacific and Indian Oceans and of Asia and Africa into a place that values freedom, the rule of law, and the market economy, free from force or coercion, and making it prosperous.” The 2016 conference in Nairobi was the first in the series to be held outside Japan. Not coincidentally, Kenya is home to the Port of Mombasa, the only international port in Kenya, the largest port in East Africa, and a key target for the Maritime Silk Road. Australia In 2011 President Barack Obama addressed the Australian Parliament, declaring that the United States was a Pacific power and “here to stay”—underlined by the announcement that U.S. Marines and military aircraft would henceforth rotate through bases in northern Australia. Three years later, during a visit to Australia to attend the Brisbane G20 Summit and finalize a bilateral free-trade agreement, President Xi Jinping told the same Parliament, “Oceania is a natural extension of the ancient maritime Silk Road, and China welcomes Australia’s participation in the twenty-first-century Maritime Silk Road.” Australia’s decision to participate in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the subsequent sale of the Port of Darwin to a company linked to the One Belt, One Road strategy in late 2015 ruffled feathers in Washington and seemed to indicate that Australia was open to Xi’s entreaty. Notwithstanding these decisions and China’s importance as a trading partner, however, Australia’s response has been ambivalent. Australia has not formally joined the Belt and Road Initiative, while successive Australian governments have refused Chinese requests to link the infrastructure aspects of the Maritime Silk Road Initiative with the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, citing concern over China’s assertiveness in the South China Sea. Recent unguarded comments by an Australian minister responsible for development assistance show that Canberra also casts a wary eye at China’s increasing project aid in the Pacific Islands to Australia’s near north, fearing it could undermine governance and render fragile states more vulnerable to coercion. United States Like Australia, the United States lies outside the direct route of the Maritime Silk Road, but not outside its reach. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) originally offered an attractive U.S.-led alternative to China’s economic vision for the region, limiting the attractiveness of Chinese economic overtures in the Indo-Pacific. It would also have acted to reinforce the international rules-based order and the Trump administration’s proclaimed objective of a “free and open” region. Instead, the U.S. withdrawal from this important, high-quality trade pact has hobbled American strategy in Asia and provided an opportunity for the spread of Chinese influence. China even invited countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to join the One Belt, One Road initiative, underscoring Beijing’s willingness to challenge the United States in its backyard in the Americas. In his recent testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Adm. Kurt Tidd, commander of the U.S. Southern Command, highlighted that the extension of One Belt, One Road to Central and South America would create security vulnerabilities for the United States likely to “compromise communication networks, and ultimately constrain our ability to work with our partners.” Today U.S. officials responsible for fleshing out the administration’s vision for a “free and open Indo-Pacific” are struggling to come up with a credible alternative to TPP as the vital economic pillar of an effective regional strategy.

The CSIS Southeast Asia Program on April 17, 2018, hosted a small, high-level roundtable discussion on U.S.-Southeast Asia Financial and Investment Relations. The first session of the roundtable focused on Southeast Asia financial integration and the role the United States might play in responding to a future financial crisis. The second session examined the state of infrastructure investment in Southeast Asia and the role the United States can play. Participants included former senior American and Southeast Asian finance officials, regional financial experts, and economists. This report summarizes the key findings and conclusions of the roundtables. The roundtable was the first in a series of events on Southeast Asian economics and trade made possible with support from Bank Negara Indonesia. The Issue - Southeast Asia has come a long way since the devastating financial turmoil of 1997 and has set up mechanisms to avoid the next shock. But in case a future crisis hits, it would be useful for the U.S. government to say upfront if it would support International Monetary Fund (IMF) support. Some in the Trump administration have said they oppose IMF bailouts. - The newest opportunity—and challenge—to Southeast Asia’s financial system is the bursting onto the scene of fintech firms. These companies are meeting the urgent needs of underserved populations. Yet their activities outstrip the ability of traditional regulators to govern their activities and protect consumers. - China’s Belt and Road Initiative could play a mighty role in meeting infrastructure needs in Southeast Asia if it is done right. But so far Beijing has said little about what it envisions the impact of its projects to be. “Will that spending help people who need it most?” asks Jonathan Hillman of CSIS’ Reconnecting Asia Project. “Will it go into viable projects…? Will it help or hurt climate change?” - “[I]n countries where public debt is already high, careful management of financing terms [for infrastructure projects] is critical,” IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said during a conference in Beijing. “This will protect both China and partner governments from entering into agreements that will cause financial difficulties in the future.” Section One: Financial Integration Southeast Asia has done well economically over the past five decades and remains one of the fastest-growing regions of the world. Per capita annual income has risen dramatically and the incidence of poverty has dropped to 14 percent from 40 percent. The region has some of the planet’s highest growth in the world averaging around 5.2 percent. This growth has been supported by trade liberalization and freer capital flows, but it still needs a lot more investment, particularly in infrastructure. More can be done to unlock the region’s full economic potential. Stepped-up financial integration in Southeast Asia is of mutual interest to the region and to the United States because it can help balance risk, foster cooperation, and bring new sources of capital and growth. U.S. treasury officials meet regularly with their Southeast Asian counterparts, but the United States is not as deeply embedded in the regional financial architecture as it could be. The newest opportunity—and challenge—to the financial system in Southeast Asia is the bursting onto the scene of financial technology, or fintech, firms. These companies and technologies are meeting the urgent needs of underserved populations and smaller firms. Yet many of their activities currently outstrip the ability of traditional regulators to govern their activities. This calls for urgent steps to update Southeast Asia’s regulations governing fintech. Since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, policymakers in Southeast Asia worked to reform their financial systems. They have built up domestic reserves through higher savings rates, introduced more flexible exchange rate regimes, applied Basel III measures to strengthen bank capital requirements, and moved cautiously to open their capital accounts. Stepped-up financial integration in Southeast Asia is of mutual interest to the region and to the United States because it can help balance risk, foster cooperation, and bring new sources of capital and growth. They have worked to achieve greater financial cooperation and integration among themselves and the larger Asian region. One of their biggest achievements has been the establishment of arrangements for regional liquidity support in the face of a future crisis. These arrangements include the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) and moves by individual countries like Indonesia and Malaysia to establish bilateral currency swap arrangements with countries including China, Japan, and South Korea. Southeast Asian finance leaders participate in the Association of Southeast Asians Nations (ASEAN) Plus Three framework, which also includes China, Japan, and South Korea. The ASEAN countries are also joined in negotiations for a Regional Comprehensive Economic Community (RCEP) trade agreement, which includes Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. It is expected that closer trade linkages under the RCEP will result in closer financial ties. Four ASEAN nations are also members of the new Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) trade agreement. ASEAN as a grouping has also moved toward greater financial services integration and harmonization of regulations under the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). Under this framework, the Southeast Asian banking community is establishing the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework (ABIF) to increase market access and operational flexibility to qualifying regional banks.1 The goals of these steps by the 10 economies, which are at very different stages of development, are to bring new sources of capital for economic growth, improve the allocation of savings, foster increased cooperation, and help balance risk. Increased financial integration also carries some risks like greater vulnerability to contagion of financial troubles across the region. To minimize risk, regulations need to be harmonized across the region and information must be shared quickly. This can help level the playing field between countries and lower the cost of financial services across Southeast Asia. Although financial integration within Southeast Asia has increased, it still lags integration on the trade side, which is much more robust. Only a small fraction of portfolio investment comes from within the region, while the majority still originates from the advanced economies of the United States and Europe. To see an uptick in capital market links would require reduced regulatory barriers and increased harmonization of regulations, including contract enforcement. To be sure, another financial crisis is possible, but much has changed in Southeast Asia since the 1997 crisis. The region’s finances are in better shape. Most of the countries are less dependent on foreign capital flows and have current account surpluses instead of the earlier deficits. In addition, most countries have bigger foreign exchange reserves and depend much less on short-term foreign credit. Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization The International Monetary Fund (IMF) with strong support from the United States played a key role in responding to the 1997 financial crisis by committing some $700 billion to affected members. However, the policy tightening required under IMF programs and the popular backlash that ensued led to concerns that they had become too dependent on the IMF, prompting the ASEAN countries to strengthen the regional financial safety net in the year 2000 by expanding an earlier bilateral ASEAN swap arrangement to include China, Japan, and South Korea, creating the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI). The CMI’s first test came in 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the United States when short-term capital quickly exited many emerging market economies. But instead of turning to the CMI, the members moved quickly to secure bilateral swaps with the United States, China, Japan, and others. This prompted an effort in 2009 to multilateralize the CMI to form the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) which would provide short-term liquidly help in case of balance of payments challenges. If the IMF is involved in responding to a crisis, how would President Donald Trump’s administration, which includes officials skeptical of IMF bailouts, respond to requests from Southeast Asia for IMF help? The CMIM included more currency swap line arrangements than the earlier initiative, and in 2014 the size of the fund was doubled to $240 billion. Officials also increased the amount available without an accompanying IMF program to 30 percent. And the members set up an independence surveillance unit in 2011, named the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO).2 These are important developments, but several issues are still left hanging. One issue is the size of the swap arrangement. The $240 billion may not be sufficient in a truly regional crisis.3 Would a troubled financial system be able to turn only to the CMIM or would the IMF also need to be involved in the support arrangements? Would it be possible for a country to circumvent the IMF entirely? If the IMF is involved in responding to a crisis, how would President Donald Trump’s administration, which includes officials skeptical of IMF bailouts, respond to requests from Southeast Asia for IMF help? Would the de facto “preferred creditor status” of the IMF prevail in a situation where shorter-term swap arrangements are also part of an overall financial package? FinTech Revolution Another challenge for Southeast Asia’s banking industry is the need to embrace the digital revolution, including the emergence of fintech to meet the growing demands of the region’s underserved consumers and small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). Fintech is the use of technological innovation to deliver financial services such as digital payments, investments, financing, and insurance to consumers and smaller businesses.4 The McKinsey Global Institute estimates the region has nearly 270 million “financially excluded” people who don’t have access to bank accounts and credit cards and some 30 million SMEs facing a credit shortage of about $175 billion.5 It is to these needs that fintech startups are trying to respond by providing consumers greater financial opportunity and inclusion. Southeast Asian banks watched the rise in China of Alibaba’s Ant Financial and Tencent’s Tenpay as major financial players in response to the fact that traditional banks were slow to meet the needs of Chinese consumers. “Alibaba and Tencent are carving up Southeast Asia,” one roundtable participant observed. “These are the competitors of the twenty-first century—they aren’t Maybank versus DBS anymore.” The region has nearly 270 million “financially excluded” people who don’t have access to bank accounts and credit cards. But DBS of Singapore and Maybank of Malaysia have seen the writing on the wall. They have responded by setting up incubator programs to support fintech startups, while fintech startups are looking to banks as anchor investors in their companies. Singapore-based ride-sharing app Grab has established a partnership with Lippo Group of Indonesia to provide a digital payment system for Grab’s over 50 million users in Indonesia.6 Alibaba and Tencent are entering Southeast Asian countries with e-commerce and mobile payment services through hookups with local players to help them adapt to local cultural norms, provide reassurance about security, and get approvals and licenses from local governments. Alibaba invested $1 billion in 2016 to gain control of Lazada Group, Southeast Asia’s largest electronics and clothing portal.7 Ant Financial, an Aliba",2013-2017,25,high_conflict
112,2015,csis,https://www.csis.org/analysis/southeast-asia-scott-circle-southeast-asia-plans-its-own-future-after-shangri-la,en,"Southeast Asia Plans for Its Own Future after Shangri-La By Shannon Hayden, Associate Director (@ShannonKHayden), Southeast Asia Program (@SoutheastAsiaDC), CSIS Members of the Asia-Pacific security community, and particularly those from Southeast Asia, wanted to be reassured by U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis’s remarks at the June 2-3 annual Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, but odds are they were not and should not have been. While Mattis hit the expected notes on regional security and the role of institutions and did his part in meeting with all 10 Southeast Asian defense ministers and 35 young Southeast Asian leaders, his words were not uttered in a vacuum. The secretary’s remarks should be seen as an interlude overshadowed by high-profile evidence of the Donald Trump administration’s commitment to an “America First” perspective, including a rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement and the Paris climate accord and a prolonged refusal by the president to acknowledge the U.S. commitment to NATO’s collective defense. Mattis’s grim aside at Shangri-La that “once we’ve exhausted all possible alternatives, the Americans will do the right thing” provides little comfort for many in Southeast Asia. Regional leaders will take much more from U.S. actions than from Mattis’s words and are considering what it means for the United States to, put kindly, diminish its focus on the Asia-Pacific region at the same time China has set forth an ambitious vision for an interconnected Eurasia through its Belt and Road Initiative. Many critiques of China’s new initiatives, including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, have been tactical, missing the broader point that of the two dominant powers in Asia, it is China that is offering a way forward and a plan for the future. The United States, meanwhile, repeatedly signals from the highest level its rejection of a range of shared commitments and the idea of a global community. This tension is acutely felt among Southeast Asian nations, who for years have asked that they not be forced to choose between the United States, a primary security partner for many, and China, increasingly the leading economic partner throughout the region. At the Shangri-La Dialogue, organized by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Mattis faced questions about whether the United States might reconsider its TPP decision in the wake of China’s May launch of its Belt and Road Initiative. The question, from Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, reveals the region’s (and Singapore’s in particular) anxiety about shifting power dynamics in the Asia Pacific. On display as well was the absence of realism regarding the South China Sea. Mattis, echoing keynote remarks from Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, stated that “we oppose countries’ militarizing artificial islands and enforcing excessive maritime claims unsupported by international law. We cannot and will not accept unilateral, coercive changes to the status quo.” But as more and more security analysts are openly saying, China has succeeded with its land reclamation efforts, is now militarizing, and has faced no real opposition—those unacceptable changes to the status quo are already here. Lt. Gen. Parmendra Kumar Singh (retired), director of the United Service Institution of India, asked at Shangri-La at what point action will take the place of talking points if it is thought that China will not stop its efforts in the South China Sea? Or, more importantly, when do the talking points change to reflect what has happened? The purest distillation of the situation facing the United States in the region comes from Hugh White, professor of strategic studies at the Australian National University, who wrote at the start of Shangri-La: ""The reality is that America will not find an effective response to China’s push to replace it as the leading power in Asia unless and until it recognizes that this will entail very large costs and risks, and decides to accept them. And that will only happen if and when Americans decide that remaining the primary power in Asia over the next few decades really matters to them. And it is far from clear that they will decide that."" The Trump administration has lagged in staffing its State and Defense departments to such a degree that “it remains to be seen what the policy will be” has become the de facto policy for the region. This is unfair to allies and partners, whose confidence in their American security partner provides maneuverability that, absent that confidence, is impossible. Piqued by Singapore’s continuous efforts to balance its relations with both the United States and China, China has twice messaged the smaller country that its independent stance has been noted—by way of intercepted armored personnel carriers and a non-invitation to Singapore’s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong to the May Belt and Road Initiative launch. In an interview during the Shangri-La Dialogue, Lee reiterated Singapore’s support for the Belt and Road Initiative and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. One wonders how Singapore might recalibrate if it believes its primary security partner’s commitments cannot be trusted. In the medium term, Southeast Asian officials are moving on and undoubtedly thinking along the same lines as leaders in Germany and Canada, with their recent statements on needing to consider security concerns and the potential unreliability of long-standing partners. Some Southeast Asian leaders, too, are contemplating new regional dynamics and wondering if American absence means new ways to cooperate with each other. Anecdotally, there is also some relief among Southeast Asian nations that under the Trump administration’s approach they will no longer feel lectured to about human rights issues, as they had been under the Obama administration on the drug war in the Philippines and the military coup in Thailand. There is plenty to debate about who might move into a gap left by the United States and human rights concerns, but these are serious points of view in the region and the United States should be aware of how its behavior since January has sent signals to nations worldwide. Shannon Hayden is associate director of the CSIS Southeast Asia Program. Biweekly Update Philippine military strikes Marawi militants’ stockpiles, seizes cash The Philippine military continues to fight ISIS-linked militants in Marawi City on the southern island of Mindanao. The military claims the ongoing battle started on May 23 when government troops conducted a raid in pursuit of Isnilon Hapilon, the declared emir of the Islamic State in Southeast Asia. The siege has so far killed 58 members of the Philippine security forces and 26 civilians, with the death toll for militant fighters believed to be over 200. Philippine marines discovered $1.6 million in cash and checks in a former militant stronghold on June 6. The military failed to meet a June 12 target date to take back control of the city. Resorts World Manila fire kills 37, officials say not a terrorist attack A lone gunman attacked and set fire to the Resorts World Manila casino on June 2, killing 37 people and himself while injuring 70 others. Philippine police said the attack was not an act of terrorism and that suffocation caused most of the casualties. Authorities identified the gunman as ex-Department of Finance employee Jessie Carlos and accused Resorts World Manila management of security lapses and fire code violations. Myanmar military plane carrying 122 passengers crashes A Myanmar military transport aircraft crashed into the Andaman Sea on June 7 with 122 passengers—soldiers, family members, and crew—onboard. Search and rescue teams continue to recover bodies, but recovery efforts have been slowed by monsoon storms. While no official explanation for the crash has been provided, Myanmar’s army chief suggested that weather was the likely cause. The Myanmar government has rejected offers of assistance from neighboring countries, including China. Hun Sen’s Cambodian People’s Party wins commune election with 51 percent of popular vote Prime Minister Hun Sen’s ruling Cambodian People’s Party won June 4 commune elections with 51 percent of the popular vote and will control 70 percent of the country’s commune councils, according to unofficial results. The opposition Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP) won 46 percent of the popular vote and will control 30 percent of the commune councils, a large increase from the 3 percent the CNRP won in 2012 elections. Vote recounts at a small number of communes began on June 12, and the official election result is due on June 25. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for July 2018. Thai man jailed for 35 years for insulting the royal family on Facebook A Thai military court on June 9 sentenced a man to 35 years in prison for Facebook posts that allegedly insulted the royal family, a violation of Thailand’s strict lèse-majesté laws. The man was arrested in Chiang Mai Province in December 2015 and had his initial sentence of 70 years cut in half because he confessed to all charges. His penalty is the longest sentence relating to defaming the royal family on record—surpassing the previous record of 30 years—according to iLaw, an advocacy group monitoring human rights cases in Thailand. Singapore and China to cooperate on Belt and Road Initiative, marking an uptick in relations Singapore foreign affairs minister Vivian Balakrishnan on June 12 announced his country’s support for China’s Belt and Road Initiative in a joint press briefing with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, who welcomed Singapore’s participation. The move appeared to mark an uptick in ties after China responded to Singapore’s support for an international tribunal ruling last July on the South China Sea by intercepting some Singaporean military personnel carriers en route from Taiwan to Singapore. China also did not invite Singapore prime minister Lee Hsien Loong to the recent Belt and Road Initiative summit in Beijing. The two countries have agreed to cooperate on various issues related to the Belt and Road Initiative, including trade linkages, financial cooperation, and training and technology transfer. Malaysia sentences nine Filipinos to death for 2013 invasion of Sabah The Malaysian Court of Appeal on June 8 sentenced nine Philippine militants to death for their role in an invasion of Malaysia’s eastern state of Sabah in 2013. In a unanimous decision, the court overturned a previous court’s life sentence for the militants, following an appeal by prosecutors for a harsher sentence. A six-week standoff in 2013 between the Malaysian armed forces and around 200 fighters from the Philippines claiming to represent the Sultanate of Sulu—which has historical claims to Sabah—left more than 70 people, mostly militants, dead. The Philippine government plans to ask Malaysia to reconsider the death sentence. Six Indonesian militants sentenced for harboring Uighur militants An Indonesian court on June 7 sentenced six Indonesian militants to three-four years in prison for conspiracy to commit terrorism and funding terrorist activities. The militants—who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State—were arrested in late 2016 for allegedly plotting a rocket attack on Singapore’s Marina Bay from Indonesia’s nearby Batam Island. While the district court ruling cleared the militants of the rocket plot, they were found guilty of committing other offenses under Indonesia’s anti-terror laws, including assisting and hiding two Uighur militants in Indonesia.

Renewable power has for the first time made up the bulk of China’s Belt and Road Initiative energy investments as the coronavirus pandemic accelerated a shift away from fossil fuels, new analysis showed. The share of wind, solar and hydropower made up 57 per cent, or about $11bn, of China’s total investment in energy infrastructure in 2020, up from 38 per cent in 2019, according to research from the International Institute of Green Finance at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing seen by the Financial Times. But the institute, which analysed a database maintained by the American Enterprise Institute combined with other sources, also found that coal investments took up a larger portion of China’s $20bn total of energy investments, up from 15 per cent in 2018 to 27 per cent last year. The green milestone was reached as Chinese foreign direct investment under the BRI continued to fall from its peak in 2015. Last year, according to IIGF’s analysis, Chinese investment to BRI countries declined faster than the expected decline in global flows into emerging economies, dropping 54 per cent year-on-year to $47bn. Christoph Nedopil Wang, director of IIGF’s Green Belt and Road Initiative Center, attributed the shift to renewables to a realisation from Chinese investors and host countries that carbon-intensive energy production carried both financial and environmental risks. “Yet, appetite for fossil fuel investments remains . . . [because of] a variety of reasons, such as a belief in the need for coal as a ‘cheap’ source of energy or due to locally available coal reserves,” Mr Nedopil Wang said. The large role of hydropower in China’s energy investments further complicates questions of sustainability. Dams produce energy without emitting carbon dioxide, but they often flood forests and other ecosystems that suck up carbon. The pandemic has strengthened a desire in developing economies to rely instead on wind and solar power. A number of countries critical to the BRI, including Egypt, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Vietnam, are drawing up plans to ensure their economic recoveries are environmentally friendly. A pledge by Xi Jinping, China’s president, to ensure China’s carbon dioxide emissions peak before 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2060 has revived hopes that Beijing will play a big role in achieving Paris climate agreement goals.

Despite China’s ambitions to be a climate leader, its companies’ and banks’ willingness to build and finance coal-fired power plants remains a significant obstacle to a global phaseout of the fossil fuel, environmentalists warned. At home, China’s investment in power production is a similar mix of rapidly expanding renewable energy and an intransigent reliance on coal power. China said it installed 120 gigawatts of wind and solar power in 2020, more than double the year before and nearly four times the UK’s installed capacity. At the same time, China approved more new coal power plants in the first half of 2020 than any year since 2015. Climate Capital Where climate change meets business, markets and politics.

128,2021,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/2024-focac-beijing-summit-a-new-chapter/,en,"The 2024 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation is by any measure the most significant diplomatic event for China this year. Being in Beijing at the time, I was struck by the magnitude of resources, policy priority, and importance attached by the Chinese government to this signature event. High-end hotels were blocked off for the dozens of delegations from African countries. Roads were closed during the rush hour to make way for their motorcades. And security measures were enhanced across the board from airports to hotel elevators—all at the expense of the host government. The FOCAC Summit takes place every three years, with its location alternating between Beijing and an African capital city. China’s announced action items, financing commitments, and policy priorities are often viewed as indicators of the future direction for China-Africa relations over the next three years. This year’s 2024 FOCAC Summit proved to be no exception. Chinese President Xi Jinping announced 10 partnership actions for China-Africa relations for 2025-2027, including civilizational exchanges, trade prosperity, industrial chain cooperation, connectivity, development cooperation, health, agriculture, people-to-people exchanges, green development, and security. China’s $50.7 billion financial commitment Since the first FOCAC in 2006, the world has witnessed China’s rapidly-growing financing commitment to Africa at the FOCAC summits: $5 billion in 2006, $10 billion in 2009, $20 billion in 2012, $60 billion in 2015, and $60 billion in 2018. A closer look at the data also shows a noticeable hike in 2013, which is when the Belt and Road Initiative was launched. Much of this financing was in the form of loans, which contributed to the narrative of China’s “debt diplomacy” in Africa and has been widely criticized for contributing to the debt distress many African countries are facing, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. However, since the pandemic, and due to its own economic slowdown, repayment concerns, and reputational costs, China has seen a gradual reduction in its financing commitments. For example, at the 2021 Dakar FOCAC, China committed only $40 billion in financing ($20 billion less than the previous FOCAC). In addition, the Chinese government significantly reduced the loan credits offered to Africa, cutting them in half as compared to the previous FOCAC commitment made in 2018. China’s renewed financial commitment during the 2024 FOCAC summit is therefore interesting in several aspects. Despite widely spread pessimism about China’s own economic slowdown and resources running low, China’s financial commitment to Africa grew by 25% at this year’s FOCAC compared to three years ago. The $50.7 billion commitment includes $10 billion in investment, $10.7 billion in aid, and $30 billion in credit lines. The investment will be made by Chinese companies but supported and promoted by the government through preferential policies on financing and subsidies. The aid will cover things from capacity building to medical assistance, which is a traditional line item. The rebound in loan credits offered is especially surprising considering the debt sustainability issues that many African countries have run into. The devil will be in the details, as it all depends on what these credits will be used to support. In the past, China had prioritized hard infrastructure projects including transportation networks (e.g., railways, roads, and bridges) backed by local natural resources. In October 2023, China claimed that its state-owned enterprises had implemented more than 1,600 infrastructure projects in Africa. In this year’s FOCAC Summit, China committed to only 30 connectivity infrastructure projects across Africa over the period 2025 to 2027. It therefore appears that China is shifting away from hard mega-infrastructure projects. New priorities and consistencies This change in course raises an important question—i.e., what is China pivoting to? In the 2024 financing commitment, there is no specification that the $30 billion in credit lines will be reserved for African governments or entities, which is different from the 2021 commitment. During the 2021 Dakar FOCAC, $10 billion was specifically reserved for African financial institutions as credits to support local African companies. The ambiguity in this year’s commitment seems to imply that as long as the projects are related to Africa or performed in Africa, the recipients do not have to be African. Indeed, $30 billion in credit is not a small figure. Given that most of the 2024 10 partnership actions announced by President Xi are focused on capacity-building and development projects, one has to wonder about where the bulk of the credit will be going. Reading between the lines, many of the action items will potentially be carried out by Chinese entities, but in collaboration with African partners. This includes the industrial chain cooperation, such as on the China-Africa digital technology cooperation centers. The action items also include green technology projects, a China-Africa forum on peaceful use of nuclear technology, 30 joint labs in science and technology, satellite remote sensing, and support for African countries’ participation in the international lunar research station project and China’s lunar and Martian exploration. They could also include China’s logistical and financial support for the development of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). If one compares the nine programs announced at the 2021 FOCAC with the 10 partnership actions announced this year, there is strong continuity between the two, including health, agriculture, trade facilitation, investment (connectivity, development, and supply chain), digital economy, capacity building, green technology, people and cultural exchanges, and peace and stability. Most of these categories also appeared in the 2018 FOCAC Summit. This suggests that China’s general approach toward Africa has strong consistency and continuity. The challenge lies in identifying new and emergent growth areas that could shape the future trajectory of China’s priority in Africa. The reality of China-Africa trade relations Trade is a pressing issue that China has to address. Trade promotion and facilitation were a priority in 2021, and that prioritization continues in 2024. Based on the FOCAC commitment this year, China is removing all tariffs on imports from least developed countries, including 33 African countries. China has also committed to expanding market access for African agricultural products and deepening cooperation in e-commerce. In addition, Beijing expressed the will to enter economic partnership framework agreements with Africa to provide “long-term, stable, and predictable institutional guarantees” for China-Africa trade and investment. These commitments happen to reveal an inconvenient truth about the imbalance in China-Africa trade relations. It is well known that China has been the largest trading partner of Africa since 2009. But it is much less well known that China has also consistently been running a trade surplus with Africa since 2015, and the gap has been growing substantially. In 2015, due to subdued global prices for major commodities, China’s trade surplus vis-à-vis Africa was as high as $38 billion. This gap further increased to $45.9 billion in 2022 and to an astounding $63 billion in 2023. So far, 2024 appears to be continuing this trend. For the first six months of this year, China ran a trade surplus against Africa of $23.7 billion. The data defies the conventional wisdom that China primarily sees Africa as the source for raw materials and natural resources. In actuality, Africa has been a bigger target for Chinese exports as a market. When being challenged on the trade imbalance between China and Africa in late 2021, the Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Qian Keming insisted that overall China-Africa trade has been largely balanced since 2000. What he neglected to mention is that the first 15 years of China’s cumulative trade deficit, vis-à-vis Africa, have been offset by a growing trade surplus since 2015. China exports finished products (textiles, machines, and electronics) to Africa and primarily imports raw materials, including crude oil, copper, iron ore, and agricultural products. Judging from the trade pattern, Africa has not improved its position in the global supply chain, and the continent remains primarily an exporter of raw materials and natural resources. This reality runs in contradiction with two Chinese narratives—that China prioritizes Africa’s industrialization and the growth of African exports. These two issues are related. Just like the Chinese vice commerce minister pointed out: “Africa must have things to sell (for China to buy).” Unless and until Africa develops sufficient industrial capacity to improve its position in the global supply chain, the trade imbalance between China and Africa is unlikely to see a solution any time soon. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that China promised $10 billion to support the growth of African exports in the 2021 FOCAC. This line item has disappeared from the 2024 commitment, suggesting that China’s emphasis on promoting African exports to China may not be as resolute as it claims. Promotion of the China Model? In China-Africa relations, the term “exchanges of governance experience” (交流治国理政经验) often carries a unique connotation. Despite the term “exchange”, the information flow is usually one way, where China promotes and spreads its own governance model to Africa. China has had decades of experience in training African political parties and government elites. The 2024 FOCAC Summit seems to suggest a keen interest in strengthening this particular effort. According to the plan, China will establish a China-Africa development knowledge network and 25 China-Africa Studies Centers. It will train “political talents” through its leadership academies in Africa, such as the Mwalimu Julius Nyerere Leadership School in Tanzania, which is nicknamed “China’s first political school in Africa”. China also plans to invite 1,000 African political party representatives to visit China and deepen the exchange of experiences in party and state governance. While this effort is not new, it is striking to see China promoting it in such a public and glorified manner, to the extent that “exchanges of governance experience” is listed as the first and foremost priority among the 10 partnership actions. At the same time, it may not be surprising, given that the Chinese government continues to hone the angle of China being the alternative development model to liberal democracy. However, given the obstacles China’s own development model has encountered in recent years, it will be interesting to see if and how China continues to showcase confidence in the irrefutability and replicability of its path. Concluding thoughts It has been 24 years since the first FOCAC Summit was held in Beijing. Since then, China-Africa relations have morphed through several modalities. From the supplier of raw materials to fuel China’s growth as the world factory to the recipient of Chinese loans for infrastructure projects, the market that Chinese manufacturers target, and the destination of Chinese capacity-building programs and trade facilitation efforts—Africa has indeed become China’s partner in many domains. While both parties have mutually benefited from the relationship, the economic and development challenges Africa faces have not been eased or mitigated. From debt stress to trade imbalance, from structural deficiencies to climate change, the continent continues to lag behind. To be sure, China is not responsible for all Africa’s quagmires, but China’s exceptionalism in Africa is losing some of its luster. And this is particularly true given the many debt restructurings that China has had to go through with African nations in the midst of the d",2018-2021,9,high_conflict
129,2021,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/biden-must-make-china-more-accountable-for-its-belt-and-road-initiative/,en,"This op ed was originally published by The Hill. Since the Marshall Plan to aid European nations after World War II, the United States has led the Western world in a substantial and evolving international assistance effort to work with other nations to grow their economies, protect their people from deprivation, and promote human rights and democracy. Over the course of this work, the U.S. and other democratic nations have learned many tough lessons. For example, we have learned that grant assistance has many fewer drawbacks than loans, which can be a huge burden on the recipient government. We have learned that transparency and accountability are necessary elements to a sustainable and effective aid program. We have learned that engagement and ownership by local stakeholders is necessary for a successful intervention. Just as critically, we have learned that American programs should be harmonized with efforts by other nations to help the developing world—or we will get in each other’s way to the detriment of the recipient nation—and through collaboration we can leverage one another’s assets. To this end, we have established formal international bodies that monitor, measure and grade development assistance programs, such as the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). In several key respects, BRI directly undermines the values of transparency, accountability, and local ownership that are the pillars of American and other Western economic development programs. When the Cold War ended, these lessons and values were applied to the remnants of the Warsaw Pact countries. The Western model of accountable and transparent foreign assistance prevailed without challenge. Now, with the rise of China as the world’s second-largest economy and burgeoning donor, that no longer is the case. China has begun its own foreign assistance program known primarily through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which spends massively in dozens of nations throughout the developing world —up to $1 trillion over the past few years—which dwarfs American and Western official development assistance. While addressing critical infrastructure needs, BRI has been criticized appropriately for merely being an extension of China’s national security strategy, designed to push back on the influence of Western governments in the Indo-Pacific and beyond, clearing the way for a more dominant Chinese presence. There is another problem with the initiative that ultimately may be profoundly more damaging to U.S. values and interests. In several key respects, BRI directly undermines the values of transparency, accountability, and local ownership that are the pillars of American and other Western economic development programs. Because China does not provide accurate data on its program and does not participate in the OECD-DAC, it can be difficult to measure Chinese inputs. What we do know is not encouraging. BRI relies on loans to developing nations, the terms of which are not transparent. According to the National Bureau for Economic Research, China’s loan terms are not disclosed, resulting in “hidden loans” that can “distort policy surveillance, risk pricing, and debt sustainability analyses.” This is anathema to Western development models, which recognize the hard lesson of the past 75 years that for assistance programs to actually lead to positive results in recipient nations, transparency is essential. Too often, China’s BRI projects are built without regard to the impact on the local economy, politics, and the values of human rights and democracy, and most often with minimal local participation. Corruptible elites are strengthened while vulnerable populations are disregarded. The incoming Biden administration has an opportunity to address this challenge in three important ways. First, with renewed U.S. leadership and participation in multilateral bodies, the United States can encourage China to adopt international standards and make Belt and Road compliant with development principles that actually benefit the recipient nations instead of damaging them. Working through international fora and like-minded development partners to highlight the harm caused by the opaque and unaccountable practices would be a terrific use of America’s newfound credibility on the international stage. Second, the Biden administration can prioritize a more robustly funded economic development program. The U.S. has a number of effective aid programs in the health, education, democracy, and humanitarian sectors, but programs to build equitable economic growth—an essential backbone of all other programs—have withered over time. In 2020, the U.S. will spend only $3.4 billion on economic programs, roughly a tenth of our total aid program. This critical component should grow over the next four years to be at least one quarter of all aid programs. Robust funding is necessary to bolster the economies of developing nations and prevent governments from being tempted by the chimera of Chinese foreign assistance, or at least demand more accountability and transparency from BRI projects. Finally, the Biden administration should examine the mixed record of the Trump administration on foreign assistance with a tough eye and a willingness to keep policies and programs that have proven effective. A coherent, holistic approach to the Chinese model of foreign assistance is required. The new International Development Finance Corporation, a bipartisan creation of Congress, in collaboration with USAID and the development finance institutions of other donors, can be an important component of a positive U.S. agenda to offer an alternative to BRI. In the developing world, we have invested too much for too long and learned too many difficult lessons to let a less productive and effective model prevail.

130,2021,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/bonding-over-beijing/,en,"Regardless of the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, China policy will remain one of the primary issues of concern to the trans-Atlantic relationship. Although a Biden administration would offer more opportunities for U.S.-European alignment, “[t]he outstanding question is […] whether the EU is really ready to hit the ground running on such a joint agenda should Biden enter the White House,” argue Erik Brattberg and Torrey Taussig. This post originally appeared in the Internationale Politik Quarterly. Over the past few years, China’s rise has become a top priority in Washington and in many European capitals—and a big-ticket item on the wider transatlantic agenda. This development has created both new opportunities and challenges for transatlantic relations. Many Europeans who were already concerned about the Obama administration’s pivot to Asia see the Trump administration’s preoccupation with countering China’s rise as representative of a bipartisan US strategic shift away from Europe and toward prioritizing great power competition in the Indo-Pacific. While Europe’s own outlook on China has also hardened recently—turning more skeptical and increasingly sharing many of the same American concerns—the United States and Europe have so far not been able to capitalize on this convergence by building anything resembling a coherent agenda to address jointly shared challenges from China. This task will be among the most pressing on the transatlantic agenda over the next four years, regardless of whether Donald Trump is reelected on November 3, or Joe Biden becomes the next US president. But the outcome of the US election will certainly have consequences. While a second Trump administration would likely continue its hard-line approach toward China and unilateral approach toward Europe, room for a more strategic and broader transatlantic dialogue on China policy is possible under Biden. A Biden administration would likely attempt to renew the transatlantic partnership as part of a global effort to attempt to rebuild alliances and partnerships that have fallen into disrepair during the Trump administration. Trump’s Unilateralism Since Trump entered office, his administration has doubled down on a hardnosed approach toward China—albeit one frequently lacking in consistency, strategic focus, or careful execution. Underpinning Trump’s China policy is a view among many in the US national security community that a more competitive approach toward Beijing was long overdue. Both the 2017 National Security Strategy and the 2018 National Defense Strategy frame the central strategic challenge confronting the US in terms of great power competition and label China a revisionist power (though it is uncertain whether Trump himself agrees with this assessment). The lion’s share of the Trump administration’s focus has been on unilateral actions against China on trade, technology access, and intellectual property theft. More recently, COVID-19 has sharpened the Trump administration’s criticism of China, making it even more ideologically loaded and nationalist. President Trump consistently refers to the coronavirus pandemic as the “China virus” and has beefed up anti-China rhetoric because he believes it will play well politically in the upcoming election and deflect blame away from his own administration’s ineffective handling of the pandemic at home. The recent pledge between US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and EU High Representative Josep Borrell to establish new EU-US China dialogue offers hope for a more joined-up approach. However, Trump’s engagement with Europe on matters related to China has underperformed, notwithstanding productive working level cooperation on issues such as 5G and investment screening. Much of the blame for the lack of effective transatlantic coordination to date falls squarely on Trump himself. Viewing the EU as an economic competitor and a “foe,” Trump has explicitly rebuffed European overtures to join forces on addressing shared concerns about China’s market-distorting practices (such as during French President Emmanuel Macron’s state visit to Washington in April 2018). In addition to his euroskeptical attitude, Trump’s erratic leadership, mixed messages, and numerous counter-productive policies have in turn contributed to undermining European trust in his administration’s leadership. Especially damaging is Trump’s trade policy toward Europe, which includes section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs, repeated threat of imposing auto tariffs, and an overreliance on extraterritorial sanctions. The Trump administration’s approach to multilateral cooperation—highlighted through its preferences for bilateral trade talks with Beijing, repeated moves to undermine the World Trade Organization (WTO), and withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN Human Rights Council—has also been self-defeating and has given China a stronger voice at the table. Further adding to Europe’s hesitance about aligning itself too closely with the US is also the increasingly ideological undertones in the Trump administration’s approach to competing with China. Europe’s disunity Of course, Europeans too have fallen short. In particular, persistent disunity among EU member states on the exact nature of the China challenge and an overarching desire to maintain strong economic ties have hindered an effective common EU response. This disunity is driven not only by southern and eastern European states that may be more reliant on Chinese investment, but also from economically strong countries such as Germany. There are several examples of how EU member states have failed to take the necessary measures to strengthen their defenses against Chinese economic and technological influence: over half of the EU member states have endorsed the Belt and Road Initiative, only 14 member states have functioning investment screening mechanisms, and countries are pursuing various approaches to the role of Huawei in 5G networks. Officials at the EU level have also acted inconsistently, at times pushing back against Beijing’s human rights abuses and policies in Hong Kong and at other times watering down EU reports of Chinese disinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Should Trump be reelected, Europeans should be ready for an even more tumultuous four years. As Sino-American tensions rise in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, intensifying the trend toward economic and technological decoupling, European countries will increasingly face tough choices. A second Trump administration would likely continue its hardline approach toward China, as Washington and Beijing appear primed to continue their tit-for-tat retaliatory actions to cut off access to one another’s technologies and economies, with Europe increasingly caught in the middle. A Trump administration would also likely continue its current competitive and divisive approach toward Europe, thereby limiting room for broad transatlantic cooperation on China policy despite shared grievances. Cooperation with the US will still be possible in certain areas, such as bolstering technologic defenses and standards, strengthening supply chains, and rebalancing trade, but transatlantic trust will remain very low and be plagued by disagreements in other areas. Restoring Transatlantic Trust China would remain a top US priority under a Biden administration. The strong bipartisan consensus in Washington on the issue means that, regardless of administration, more continuity is expected on issues such as 5G and technology decoupling, curtailing Chinese investments, and the continued focus on strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific. The different starting-point for a Biden administration is that Washington would look to reengage with its allies and partners in Europe on a less competitive and divisive platform. Rather than seeing Europe as a competitor, Biden would view the EU as an integral partner for shaping a joint approach toward China. By defusing EU-US tensions and restoring transatlantic trust, Biden would likely be able to carry out more effective diplomatic engagement with European counterparts compared to the Trump administration’s heavy-handed unilateral approach. Moreover, by righting trade and sanctions policies, and easing political tensions on key issues such as climate change, a more fruitful agenda on shaping global standards on Artificial Intelligence (AI), semiconductors, or green tech might also be within reach. Another welcome departure from Trump as seen by Europeans would be on the issue of multilateralism. While a Biden administration is unlikely to blindly embrace multilateralism, his administration would likely engage on multilateral reform initiatives, with a particular focus on WTO rules reform. Given Biden’s strong climate agenda, the administration could also work with Europe to hold China accountable to the climate targets that agreed to as a signatory to the Paris Climate Accords and would put a stronger emphasis on human rights (an issue that Trump has downplayed). Biden has also pledged to convene a summit of democracies and may be keen to take up the United Kingdom’s recent idea of establishing a D-10 of leading democracies in North America, Europe, and Asia. Finally, Biden would likely take a less ideological view of China, preferring to see Beijing as a “serious competitor” but not necessarily as an opponent—mirroring the EU’s view of China as a systemic rival, a competitor, and a partner. This would make it easier for Europeans to work with Washington on China issues, as Europe shares many of the US concerns but is afraid of getting pulled into a confrontational agenda between the two superpowers. Of course, not everything would be smooth sailing even under a Biden administration. The EU and the US will continue to have differences on many issues—including on defense spending, data protection, and export controls. Biden’s expected heavy focus on human rights might also give rise to new tensions with Europe should the US actively push for more sanctions against Chinese human rights violators or new technological restrictions that Europe is unwilling to make. The “China Factor” After 2021 Regardless of the outcome of the US presidential election in November, how to address the rise of China and Beijing’s growing assertiveness post-COVID-19 will be one of the dominant issues in transatlantic relations under the next administration. Even if Trump is reelected and the overall transatlantic agenda remains fraught, Europe has no choice but to continue engaging with Washington on a shared China agenda. Although there will be limits to what such an agenda can realistically achieve, there will still be some opportunities for cooperation on technology and trade issues in particular, given longstanding concerns from Washington and key European capitals about Beijing’s behavior. In contrast, the prospect of a Biden administration will offer some early opportunities for alignment on holding China accountable to climate and trade standards while developing a broader strategic dialogue on China. Yet this also assumes greater European openness to engaging in a robust dialogue with Washington as well as continued efforts to forge a common European strategy toward China including on the dicier foreign policy issues such as Hong Kong and Taiwan or human rights in Xinjiang. The outstanding question is then whether the EU is really ready to hit the ground running on such a joint agenda should Biden enter the White House in January. The “China factor” will be a permanent fixture on the 21st-century transatlantic agenda.

131,2021,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/can-china-fill-the-void-in-foreign-aid/,en,"With the United States significantly downsizing its provision of international aid, a key question that has emerged from the Global South and traditional donor community is whether China will exploit the opportunity and fill the void. A careful examination of the nature, size, type, and motivation of China’s aid reveals the improbability of China replacing the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in the foreign assistance space. There is a significant gap in the size of aid First, China’s foreign aid has consistently been a fraction of America’s. It is a common misperception that China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is aid. In reality, the overwhelming majority of BRI financing is loans, including $327 billion disbursed by the Export-Import Bank of China by the end of 2022, and investments, including $300 billion invested by Chinese commercial entities by the end of 2023. Fudan University put China’s cumulative BRI engagement between 2013 and 2023 at $1.053 trillion: about $634 billion in construction contracts and $419 billion in non-financial investments. The BRI essentially consists of commercial activities with a tint of development finance. That’s why they are often referred to as “BRI engagement,” and never as foreign aid. According to U.S. government data, in the 2023 fiscal year, USAID’s budget was about $42 billion, including approximately $17 billion for governance, $9.4 billion for humanitarian assistance, $7 billion for health and population, $3.5 billion for administrative costs, $1.3 billion for agriculture, $1.1 billion for education, $740 million for infrastructure, $720 million for economic development. USAID has not been the only government implementing agency for foreign assistance. The State Department also had a nearly $19 billion budget for foreign assistance, along with the Department of Treasury (about $2 billion), the Department of Agriculture (about $450 million), etc. In comparison, Chinese foreign aid is significantly smaller. According to the 2021 version of China’s foreign aid white paper “China’s International Development Cooperation in the New Era,” between 2013 and 2018, China’s total foreign aid reached 270.2 billion RMB (around $42 billion based on the average exchange rate during the same period). That means China spent an average of $7 billion on foreign aid annually during this time period. But during the same period, the United States spent $286 billion on foreign aid,1 or $47.7 billion per year. Thus, from 2013 to 2018, Chinese aid only amounted to 14.6% of what America spent. China has not published its aid data since 2018. But a 2024 Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) report put the annual average amount of Chinese aid at 20.5 billion RMB from 2013 to 2022 (approximately $3.13 billion at the average exchange rate during this period). The discrepancy between this data and the above data is most likely due to the multilateral aid China provides to international organizations, which goes through the Ministry of Finance rather than MOFCOM. But COVID-19 and China’s travel restrictions and economic slowdown also contributed to the decrease in Chinese aid since 2020. MOFCOM’s foreign aid budget dropped 20% from 19.7 billion RMB (approximately $3 billion) in 2018 to 16.8 billion RMB (approximately $2.6 billion) in 2021. The current size of Chinese bilateral foreign aid can be deducted from the budgets of China’s two primary aid agencies: the Ministry of Commerce and the China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA). By its mandate, MOFCOM is “responsible for foreign aid, design and implement foreign aid policy and plans, promote foreign aid reforms, compile foreign aid plans, decide on foreign aid projects and organize their implementation, and manage the use of government funding under the category of foreign aid.” In comparison, CIDCA’s responsibility is more on the management side: foreign aid strategy, the overall size of foreign aid, priorities of Chinese aid, feasibility studies, policy coordination with recipient countries, as well as the monitoring and evaluation of foreign aid projects. MOFCOM’s foreign aid budget for 2024 is 20.48 billion RMB, roughly $2.82 billion. CIDCA’s foreign aid is much smaller: 54 million RMB for foreign aid and 131.2 million RMB for international development cooperation, bringing us to a total of 186.2 million RMB, approximately $25.62 million. The total foreign aid budget of the two institutions is $2.85 billion for 2024. This number aligns with the overall trend of China’s economic slowdown and reduced engagement since COVID-19. But it also means the volume of Chinese aid is only a fraction of U.S. foreign aid. Different motives and purposes The United States and China also use aid very differently. According to China’s official documents, Chinese foreign aid is divided into three categories: grants, zero-interest loans, and concessional loans. Grants are the traditional foreign aid projects in the Western definition, including welfare projects, capacity building, technical assistance, humanitarian assistance, material support, and South-South cooperation aid. Zero-interest loans are used to develop public facilities and social projects. Historically, zero-interest loans are usually forgiven eventually. And concessional loans are used to develop large infrastructure projects and production projects in developing countries, including equipment, machines, and technical support among others. Concessional loans are the most misunderstood category. The principal of Chinese concessional loans is raised on the market by the Export-Import Bank of China, but the loans’ lower interest rates are subsidized by China’s foreign aid budget, meaning that Chinese foreign aid is used to offset the differences between the concessional loan interest rates and commercial loan interest rates. If we look at the historical distribution of China’s foreign aid budget, we get the data below: A striking takeaway from the data is the significant increase in foreign aid spending on concessional loans since 2009, which aligns with China’s push for hard infrastructure since 2010 and under BRI. It is well known that China’s concessional loans are aimed at promoting the export of Chinese contract services and products, often using recipient countries’ natural resources as collateral. Since Xi Jinping took over in 2013, the weight assigned to grants has increased, which coincides with China’s push for soft power influence, but it’s still smaller than concessional loans. The data also shows that China’s spending on what USAID traditionally focuses on—“grants,” such as capacity building and humanitarian assistance—is less than 50% of its total foreign aid budget, at $3.29 billion during 2013-2018, and potentially around $1.5 billion a year in the 2024 budget if the same distribution remains. Does China intend to step in? Given China’s sluggish economy and the uncertainty associated with the Trump administration, China does not see foreign aid as a priority in the immediate future. The withdrawal of U.S. foreign assistance will leave China with bigger weight in a smaller space, but it doesn’t mean China can step in to fill the void. Given the selfish motives that guide China’s aid program, USAID’s portfolio of traditional humanitarian work does not overlap with China’s aid work. China has its own capacity-building programs, such as the training of political elites, government officials, and subject-matter experts from Africa and Southeast Asia. Those programs have a strong component of promoting China’s governance model and exporting China’s political ideology. China is unlikely to augment those programs simply because the United States is no longer as engaged in aid for governance or democratic institutions. However, left uncontested after the withdrawal of USAID programming, the influence of Chinese political capacity-building projects could grow in recipient countries in the long run. China’s tradition of bilaterally negotiating aid also means that the demand for more Chinese foreign assistance from less developed countries will be decided on a case-by-case basis. China’s ambassador to Syria recently met with the country’s new president, Ahmad Al-Sharaa. But any discussion of Chinese aid to Syria’s post-conflict reconstruction will start with the Chinese question of Uyghur militants serving in the Syrian army, just like China has conditioned more aid as well as diplomatic recognition of the Afghan Taliban regime upon the deportation of Uyghur militants living in Afghanistan. Similarly, in the post-conflict reconstruction of Ukraine and Gaza, China is unlikely to altruistically disburse free aid, but will instead seek political, diplomatic, and economic returns for its assistance. For example, China’s contribution toward Gaza’s reconstruction will likely be associated with service contracts funded by Gulf states for Chinese contractors; its contribution to the reconstruction of Ukraine will potentially be linked to future economic projects in the country. In both cases, China will try to use its contribution to consolidate ties with the Muslim world and Europe, respectively. For global nontraditional security threats such as food security, climate change, health, and disease control, China is more likely to resort to acting through multilateral organizations. This is in line with China’s historical behavior. The world really has not seen China unilaterally taking the lead on any global challenges. This doesn’t mean China will not increase its contribution to multilateral organizations to address these issues, but such increases can neither be assumed nor guaranteed. Most likely, China will operate under the umbrella of a U.N.-led effort rather than assume responsibility for addressing any of these challenges on its own or as leader of a consortium of countries. Even with its limited assistance levels, China will nevertheless seek to exploit the opportunity of American withdrawal to portray the United States as the irresponsible great power, even if U.S. foreign assistance levels after the cut continue to exceed Chinese foreign aid. With the dramatic nature of how the U.S. foreign aid reform is unfolding, the Chinese message will be loud and particularly resonating in the Global South. - Footnotes - The United States spent $46 billion in 2013, $44 billion in 2014, $50 billion in 2015, $50 billion in 2016, $48 billion in 2017, $48 billion in 2018.

In September 2021, after 14 years of impactful partnership, Brookings and the Brookings Doha Center announced that they were ending their affiliation. The Brookings Doha Center is now the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, a separate public policy institution based in Qatar. Executive summary1 The southern shores of the Mediterranean have become one of the most significant sites of great power competition as the United States continues to take a back seat in global affairs. A power vacuum left by a disengaged United States and a weakened Europe has created an opening for powers like China and Russia to expand their influence across North Africa. This is most apparent in the intensifying hard power battles in Libya’s proxy war, but it is also present in soft power competition in trade, investment, tourism, and cultural dissemination. China prefers a more comprehensive, soft power approach rooted in primarily economic ties, while Russia strategically chooses settings to display hard military power and defense diplomacy. In North Africa, China has expanded relations primarily through growing economic and commercial ties under the framework of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Russia plays a more overtly military and defense role in shaping security dynamics in the southern Mediterranean, notably by stoking Libya’s proxy war and supporting military strongman General Khalifa Haftar and through greater military cooperation and arms deals with other states such as Egypt. The focus of this paper is primarily on China’s growing footprint in the southern Mediterranean within the context of great power competition, notably Russia’s expanding influence and America’s declining engagement. China-North Africa relations include both hard and soft power elements. However, China’s role in the region is still in a nascent phase, rooted in primarily soft power linkages and diplomacy. Beijing’s increasing ties in these countries centers largely on trade, infrastructure development, ports, shipping, financial cooperation, tourism, and manufacturing. In particular, this analysis examines Chinese bilateral ties with Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt, while also including a discussion on China’s Libya policy. Notably, China’s relations with these countries are framed by its official policy of non-interference in political affairs, in contrast to the policies of historical Western partners. Likewise, these five countries, to varying extents, increasingly view China as a viable alternative partner to Europe and the United States, leading them to expand their cooperation with Beijing, not only on economic and cultural matters, but also on diplomacy and defense issues. At present, this reflects how North African countries are seeking to diversify their strategic alliances to gain some bargaining power vis-à-vis traditional partners like the United States and Europe. It is unlikely that countries like China and Russia will replace Western economic and political influence in North Africa in the near future, but as the United States continues to disengage, Europe is losing its key security partner. This means that both the United States and the European Union are losing their ability to influence security dynamics in the southern Mediterranean. Overall, the strategic location of these five countries means that China’s presence will only continue to expand, especially in the economic realm. - Footnotes - This paper is an expansion of the authors’ policy brief, “Beijing calling: Assessing China’s growing footprint in North Africa,” (Doha: Brookings Doha Center, September 23, 2019), https://www.brookings.edu/research/beijing-calling-assessing-chinas-growing-footprint-in-north-africa/.

133,2021,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/china-is-not-10-feet-tall/,en,"China, the story goes, is inexorably rising and on the verge of overtaking a faltering United States. China has become the largest engine of global economic growth, the largest trading nation, and the largest destination for foreign investment. It has locked in major trade and investment deals in Asia and Europe and is using the Belt and Road Initiative—the largest development project of the twenty-first century—to win greater influence in every corner of the world. It is exporting surveillance tools, embedding technology in 5G communications networks, and using cyber-capabilities to both steal sensitive information and shape political discourse overseas. It is converting economic and political weight into military might, using civil-military fusion to develop cutting-edge capabilities and bullying its neighbors, including U.S. allies and partners such as Australia, India, and Taiwan. And at home, it is ruthlessly cracking down everywhere from Hong Kong to Xinjiang, with little concern about criticism from the United States and other democratic governments. Among the most eager purveyors of this story line are China’s government-affiliated media outlets. Projecting self-assurance, they have also gone out of their way to contrast their own achievements with plentiful examples of American dysfunction. They point to images of insurrectionists storming the U.S. Capitol and of American citizens standing in line for water during power outages in Texas as evidence of the decay of “Western democracy.” They celebrate China’s success in “defeating” COVID-19 and reopening the country, while the United States and other Western countries still struggle to stop the spread of the virus. “Time and momentum are on our side,” Chinese President Xi Jinping declared in a speech at the Communist Party’s Fifth Plenum last fall. In January, Chen Yixin, a top security official, told a Chinese Communist Party study session, “The rise of the East and decline of the West has become a trend.” Authoritarian systems excel at showcasing their strengths and concealing their weaknesses. But policymakers in Washington must be able to distinguish between the image Beijing presents and the realities it confronts. China is the second most powerful country in the world and the most formidable competitor the United States has faced in decades. Yet at the same time, and in spite of its many visible defects, the United States remains the stronger power in the U.S.-Chinese relationship—and it has good reason to think it can stay that way. For all the obstacles facing the United States, those facing China are considerably greater. During the Cold War, Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger cautioned against “ten-foot-tall syndrome”: the tendency among U.S. policymakers to view their Soviet competitors as towering figures of immense strength and overwhelming intellect. A similar syndrome has taken hold in the United States today, and the harms are not just analytical. Concentrating on China’s strengths without accounting for its vulnerabilities creates anxiety. Anxiety breeds insecurity. Insecurity leads to overreaction, and overreaction produces bad decisions that undermine the United States’ own competitiveness. Seeing China clearly is the first step toward getting China policy right. THE MISMEASURE OF THE MIDDLE KINGDOM China poses the most direct test of U.S. foreign policy in decades. Not since the Cold War has a country seriously contested U.S. leadership in multiple regions of the world simultaneously. The combination of military strength, economic weight, and global ambition makes China a different—and more complex—challenge than the Soviet Union presented during the Cold War. In recent years, Beijing has made plain its revisionist ambitions. It seeks adjustments to the distribution of power in the international system, the security order in Asia, the role and remit of international institutions, the free flow of uncensored information across borders, and the liberal nature of the existing international order. It wants its Leninist political model and state-led economic model to be accepted and respected. It has signaled that it will brook no challenges to its conception of its territorial boundaries or its management of domestic affairs. And it has declared a national goal of becoming the world leader in a growing number of advanced technologies, from artificial intelligence to electric vehicles. But it is hardly a foregone conclusion that China will travel a linear path toward realizing its goals. For an accurate measure of the challenges China poses to U.S. interests, Beijing’s strengths must be evaluated alongside its vulnerabilities. Xi and his advisers face as stiff a set of challenges as almost anyone else in the world. The United States remains the stronger power in the U.S.-Chinese relationship. Consider China’s seemingly unstoppable economic ascent. In reality, the challenges over the medium term are significant. China is at risk of growing old before it grows rich, becoming a graying society with degrading economic fundamentals that impede growth. The working-age population is already shrinking; by 2050, China will go from having eight workers per retiree now to two workers per retiree. Moreover, it has already squeezed out most of the large productivity gains that come with a population becoming more educated and urban and adopting technologies to make manufacturing more efficient. China is running out of productive places to invest in infrastructure, and rising debt levels will further complicate its growth path. In the past decade alone, China’s debt has more than doubled, from 141 percent of GDP in 2008 to over 300 percent in 2019. Ballooning debt will make it harder for China to buy its way up the ladder from low-end manufacturing to high value-added production, as South Korea and Taiwan did at similar levels of development. Meanwhile, the political system is growing increasingly sclerotic as power becomes more concentrated around Xi. Once renowned for technocratic competence, the Chinese Communist Party is becoming better known for Leninist rigidity. Space for local policy experimentation appears to be shrinking, as more decisions become concentrated in Beijing. The top-down nature of the system has also made it more difficult for officials to revisit past decisions or report bad news to the top. This dynamic likely contributed to the slow early response to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan. Although the leadership has made notable gains in alleviating extreme poverty, it also has become increasingly anxious and uncompromising in clamping down on perceived challenges to its authority. Beijing’s rigid ethos for imposing its will along the country’s peripheral regions, including but not limited to Xinjiang, may bring future problems. Externally, China faces formidable obstacles to its ambitions. Beijing’s repression at home, assertiveness abroad, and efforts to conceal critical initial details surrounding the coronavirus pandemic have contributed to rising negative views toward China. According to Pew polling from October 2020, unfavorable views of China have reached historic highs across a diverse set of countries. Beijing is also likely to encounter rising budgetary constraints on its massive overseas initiatives in the coming years, as it contends with both a cooling economy and rising demands from an aging society. From a strategic perspective, China’s military likely will remain relatively constrained for the foreseeable future in its ability to project force beyond its immediate periphery, let alone to marry power projection with political and economic influence on a global scale—definitional features of a superpower. China confronts a uniquely challenging geography. It is bordered by 14 countries, four of which are nuclear armed and five of which harbor unresolved territorial disputes with Beijing. These include an aging but wealthy Japan, a rising and nationalistic India, a revanchist Russia, a technologically powerful South Korea, and a dynamic and determined Vietnam. All these countries have national identities that resist subordination to China or its interests. And the United States maintains a constant forward-deployed military presence in the region, supported by basing and access agreements in countries along China’s periphery. China is also vulnerable when it comes to food and energy security. It lacks enough arable land to feed its population and imports roughly half its oil from the Middle East. In a conflict, Chinese naval capacity would be insufficient to prevent China from being cut off from vital supplies. Beijing is working to address this vulnerability, but there are no quick or easy solutions. THE CASE FOR SELF-CONFIDENCE Washington’s bipartisan move in recent years to a hard-line approach to China has been driven above all by Beijing: Chinese leaders have grown more impatiently aggressive in the pursuit of their ambitions and have increasingly leaned on nationalism, particularly as ideology and economic performance have become diminishing sources of social cohesion. But much of the shift in Washington has also been driven by a growing sense of panic about China’s strengths, leading to a bout of American insecurity. Such panic is unlikely to prove constructive: an alarmed focus on degrading China’s strengths risks causing the United States to focus too little on the more essential task of bolstering its own. Any attempt to use the China threat to spur domestic reform or overcome domestic division is likely to do more harm than good. At home, inflating the China threat will encourage the political weaponization of the issue, with China serving as a tool for ambitious politicians to discredit opponents for being weak. Abroad, such an approach will widen divisions with allies and partners, almost none of whom share Washington’s view that China is an existential threat. And it is likely to encourage policies that in an effort to harm China, end up doing equal or greater harm to the United States—including by foreclosing coordination with Beijing on issues of vital importance to Americans. It is hardly a foregone conclusion that China will travel a linear path toward realizing its goals. The Trump administration’s trade policies offer a clear demonstration of this dynamic. Tariffs on Chinese imports were sold as a tool to compel Chinese capitulation to U.S. concerns about unfair trading practices. In fact, they had little success in forcing desired economic changes in China, and they triggered Chinese retaliation that did plenty of harm in the United States: a rising trade deficit, losses to U.S. farmers that resulted in a $28 billion bailout, and the elimination of an estimated 245,000 jobs. The United States has good reason to be confident about its ability to compete with China. The U.S. economy is still $7 trillion larger than China’s. The United States enjoys energy and food security, comparatively healthy demographics, the world’s finest higher education system, and possession of the world’s reserve currency. It benefits from peaceful borders and favorable geography. It boasts an economy that allocates capital efficiently and traditionally serves as a sponge for the brightest thinkers and the best ideas in the world. It has a transparent and predictable legal system and a political system that is designed to spur self-correction. China has none of these attributes. Self-confidence should foster a steady, patient, and wise response to China’s rise—one that can attract broad support at home and abroad. Some elements of this approach will require standing up to Chinese actions that challenge U.S. interests and values even while pushing Beijing to contribute more to efforts to address transnational challenges, such as building a global disease surveillance network and decarbonizing the global economy. At the same time, U.S. policymakers will need to accept that coexiste",2018-2021,19,high_conflict
134,2021,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-is-poised-to-transform-the-clean-energy-industry/,en,"“All roads lead to Rome” was no exaggeration: The Roman Empire depended upon 250,000 miles of roads for maintaining and supporting its 70 million inhabitants. In the 21st century, Chinese President Xi Jinping would seem to have similar strategic ambitions with regard to China’s multi-trillion dollar “Belt and Road Initiative” (BRI). Stretching across Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe, BRI represents a strategic trade network for Chinese goods and services. One industry that could benefit enormously from BRI is clean energy technologies. Beijing’s 12th Five-Year Plan directly focuses on investments in advanced technologies, especially clean energy technology. Even as the Trump administration has introduced policies to undermine U.S. renewables, China is making a long term pivot that will transform its expansive energy infrastructure. The largest infrastructure project in history, BRI includes a vast economic “belt” made up of six overland corridors and a new “Maritime Silk Road” linking a chain of seaports stretching from the South China Sea to Africa. The Beijing-led initiative is expected to span 76 countries across four continents, overlapping one-third of global GDP, a quarter of all traded goods, and more than 60% of the world’s total population. Participants include Russia, Poland, Hungary, Greece, Israel, Austria, Serbia, Estonia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Kenya, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, among others. The Clean Energy SuperPower Notwithstanding the country’s voracious appetite for coal and oil, China will invest more than $6 trillion in low-carbon power generation and other clean-energy technologies over the next 20 years. Global energy demand is expected to rise 30 percent by 2040 with investments in new power generation capacity expanding to $10.2 trillion. The majority of that investment— nearly $7.4 trillion— will be in renewable energy generating capacity. As the International Energy Agency (IEA) explains, the scale of China’s clean energy investment is key to the momentum now driving low-carbon energy technologies. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that China has already invested $47 billion in dominating solar panel manufacturing. In fact, China has invested billions in large overseas deals involving renewable energy: China has introduced the world’s largest carbon market, it leads the world in the construction of nuclear power plants, and sells more electric vehicles than the rest of the world combined. Given the fact that some 50 percent of the world’s energy could come from solar and wind, China looks poised to become the world’s first clean energy superpower. Indeed, China could generate 80 percent of its energy from renewables by 2050. The country’s unique capacity for large-scale infrastructure projects suggests that BRI will be critical to moving global energy consumption beyond fossil fuels. To this end, China has issued nearly $25 billion worth of green bonds for infrastructure investments across a range of categories including clean energy, clean transport, resource conservation and recycling, pollution prevention and control, energy saving, and ecological protection. Greening the New Silk Road BRI supports China’s long-term strategic shift around advanced technologies and clean energy. The initiative will open new markets for China’s formidable industrial expertise, including the country’s accelerating proficiency in renewable technologies. According to the IEA, China now has one-third of the world’s wind power, four of the top ten wind-turbine makers, six of the top ten solar-panel manufacturers, and a quarter of the world’s solar capacity. As the principal market for renewable energy worldwide, China hopes to provide “green, low-carbon and circular development” to Asia’s 4.3 billion consumers in the development of a “Green Belt and Road”. To put things in perspective, renewables are expected to meet more than 70% of global electricity generation growth by 2023. Even as fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) are predicted to remain the dominant source of energy through 2050, Beijing’s geopolitical ambitions could reshape the global energy equation. Forecasts by McKinsey suggest that electricity will account for a quarter of all energy demand by 2050 (compared with just 18 percent today). In fact, more than three-quarters of all new capacity (77 percent) will come from wind and solar and just 13 percent from natural gas. Not surprisingly, China and India will account for 71 percent of all new electricity capacity. What seems clear is that clean energy is a 21st century industry that China is well positioned to dominate. Where the Trump administration sees renewable energy as a threat to jobs, China is leveraging clean energy as part of a long-term strategic gambit. Long-term planners in the United States and elsewhere would do well to take note. Renewables are expected to make up half of all power generation by 2050 with China leading the way. Given the continuing fall in the cost of battery storage and the massive growth in electric vehicles (50% of all cars by 2050), China’s clean energy investments through BRI look poised to utterly transform the global clean energy industry.

China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a leading indicator of the scale of China’s global ambitions. The intent behind the initiative—either economic or strategic—has raised significant concern in the United States and elsewhere. While Beijing portrays the infrastructure development initiative as a benign investment and development project that is economically beneficial to all parties—and in certain cases clearly has been—there are strategic manifestations that contradict this depiction. Washington is skeptical of the initiative, warning of the risks to recipients and the harm it will cause to America’s strategic interests abroad. But many of America’s partners reject the U.S. interpretation and are forging ahead with Beijing. Ahead of China’s second Belt and Road Summit in late April 2019, Brookings Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy Bruce Jones convened seven Brookings scholars—Amar Bhattacharya, David Dollar, Rush Doshi, Ryan Hass, Homi Kharas, Mireya Solís, and Jonathan Stromseth—to interrogate popular perceptions of the initiative, as well as to evaluate the future of BRI and its strategic implications. The edited transcript below reflects their assessment of China’s motivations for launching BRI, its track record to date, regional responses to it, the national security implications of BRI for the United States, as well as potential policy responses. The highlights: - Originally conceptualized as a “going out” strategy to develop productive outlets for domestic overcapacity and to diversify China’s foreign asset holdings, Beijing later branded the effort as its “Belt and Road Initiative.” While the initiative began with a predominantly economic focus, it has taken on a greater security profile over time. - China’s initiative has attracted interest from over 150 countries and international organizations in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. This is due, in part, to the fact that the initiative is meeting a need and filling a void left by international financial institutions (IFI) as they shifted away from hard infrastructure development. But there is a real possibility that the BRI will follow in the footsteps of the IFIs, encounter the same problems, and falter. - China has been responsive to requests from recipient countries. This adaptability has made BRI resilient and attractive to recipient governments in spite of popular concerns expressed through the ballot box in multiple countries. - BRI shouldn’t be seen as a traditional aid program because the Chinese themselves do not see it that way and it certainly does not operate that way. It is a money-making investment and an opportunity for China to increase its connectivity. - The initiative has a blend of economic, political, and strategic agendas that play out differently in different countries, which is illustrated by China’s approach to resolving debt, accepting payment in cash, commodities, or the lease of assets. The strategic objectives are particularly apparent when it comes to countries where the investment aligns with China’s strategy of developing its access to ports that abut key waterways. - Japan has long played a quiet but leading role in providing alternative options for recipient countries in need of capital-intensive infrastructure investment. Recently, Tokyo has undertaken significant reforms to elevate its ability to both compete with and complement BRI projects. - China’s investments in strategically sensitive ports and its development of an overseas military base in Djibouti are of great concern to the United States. Additionally, BRI projects have caused unease in Washington and elsewhere due to their impact on democratic governance, debt sustainability, and existing international environmental and labor standards. Internationally, a growing number of developing countries are themselves expressing concern about Chinese intent. - U.S. policymakers should adapt American strategy to respond to BRI. Some scholars believe that the right strategy is to multilaterize efforts, while others argue that it is to promote a race-to-the-top dynamic vis-à-vis China. Either strategy requires working proactively with allies and partners to regain the initiative on infrastructure programs, and to pre-emptively ring-fence areas of strategic concern from future Chinese investments. And there need to be increased efforts to foster an independent media in recipient countries that is capable of scrutinizing BRI projects.

They have organized their diplomacy to seek to break out of an American-led “encirclement.” To do so, they have advanced initiatives to center their country in the international system and to de-center the United States. They have sought to expand China’s influence in regions and on issues that are relatively less contested, while also working to limit the formation of blocs arrayed against them. Chinese officials also have attempted to reduce American pressure on China. While the sum of these efforts may yield results over time, they have not yet reversed or significantly reduced the strategic pressures Beijing now faces. The tone of China’s official pronouncements about its external environment has grown more pessimistic over the past year. Public projections of triumphalism about time and momentum being on China’s side have given way to warnings about China’s “complex and severe” national security environment.[1] In his work report to the 20th Party Congress in October 2022, President Xi Jinping for the first time dedicated a section to national security, referring to it as “the bedrock of national rejuvenation.”[2] During the period since, Chinese leaders have declared the need for new development patterns to overcome “headwinds” to China’s continued rise.[3] China’s leaders seem increasingly consumed with confronting perceived obstacles to their country’s rise. In uncharacteristically pointed public comments for a Chinese leader, Xi stated at a panel discussion on the sidelines of the National People’s Congress in March 2023, “Western countries, led by the United States, have implemented all-around containment and suppression of China, which has brought unprecedented severe challenges to the country’s development.”[4] In the face of these challenges, Xi has declared that China can survive by seeking security through struggle but risks perishing if it seeks security through compromise.[5] A variety of factors likely inform Chinese leaders’ rising emphasis on national security. At a conceptual level, as China expert Sheena Chestnut Greitens has argued, Xi appears obsessed with fortifying Beijing’s capacity to guard against challenges to the governing authority of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).[6] This focus on snuffing out threats has led to purges of political rivals, clampdowns on sectors of the Chinese economy, crackdowns on foreign entities operating inside China, and calls for heightened vigilance against foreign infiltration and manipulation of Chinese society. This preoccupation with guarding against challenges to CCP rule does not stop at the border. It also colors China’s foreign policy by adding a securitized tint to Beijing’s relations with other countries. Beijing’s insecurities are heightened by China’s economic situation. The predicted post-COVID-19 lockdown economic boom has not materialized. Consumer demand has been weak, exports have been flagging, the property sector remains stuck in doldrums, industrial output has been faltering, and foreign direct investment into China has been declining.[7] Youth unemployment is at record levels.[8] Restrictions on Chinese access to foreign high-technology inputs, such as advanced semiconductor chips, have been tightening. Although there are bright spots in the economy – China’s electric vehicle industry is booming and its clean energy sector is globally dominant – the overall direction is toward a structural slowdown in economic growth. Externally, Xi’s big bet on Russian President Vladimir Putin is looking less safe. Moscow’s botched invasion of Ukraine has weakened Russia as a useful counterweight against Western pressure. The Wagner Group’s brief rebellion in June 2023 exposed potential vulnerabilities to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s grip on power. Xi’s decision to overlook Russia’s barbarism in Ukraine has come at the expense of China’s relations with Europe. And as the United States and Europe increasingly have converged around policies of de-risking and diversifying supply chains to reduce dependence on China, the material costs of Xi’s bad bet have come into sharper focus. Beijing also has been on edge about America’s efforts to expand networks of partners in Asia and beyond, which it views as being aimed at constraining China. Beijing sees partnerships, such as the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) accord, the Australia-India-Japan-United States “Quadrilateral Grouping,” and the Japan-Republic of Korea-United States trilateral mechanism, as hemming China in and limiting its freedom of maneuver. In response, China’s leaders have become more active on the world stage since the lifting of the COVID-19 lockdown in December 2022. As shown in Figure 1, China’s frequency of leader-level engagements in foreign affairs increased in the six months after the lifting of the COVID-19 restrictions in comparison to the six months before the emergence of COVID-19.

As Figure 2 shows, China’s top officials have focused on building relations along their periphery and working to limit the damage to China’s relations with Europe. Figure 2: Diplomatic Outreach by Top Chinese Leaders (Dec 2022–July 2023).

Nevertheless, according to a senior Chinese scholar who is regularly consulted on policy deliberations, the mood in Beijing is such that China is under hostile pressure from American-led efforts to damage China’s international image and to suppress its rise. Beijing’s goal is to break out of this situation. [9] The remainder of this essay explores how Beijing is trying to accomplish this goal and whether such efforts are bearing fruit. Centering China in International Architecture while De-centering the United States Beijing has been advancing three interwoven initiatives that have become the cornerstone of its foreign policy over the past two years – the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative. These initiatives appear regularly in speeches and readouts of meetings involving top Chinese officials.[10] Xi announced the Global Development Initiative at the United Nations General Assembly in 2021.[11] He called for the world to work toward more “balanced, coordinated, and inclusive growth,” which he contrasted with the unequal distribution of benefits from the Western-led approach. In April 2022, Xi rolled out the Global Security Initiative at the Boao Forum.[12] He framed the initiative around China’s support for indivisible, balanced, and sustainable security versus (American-led) efforts to employ alliances and sanctions in pursuit of absolute security. In March 2023, Xi unveiled the Global Civilization Initiative at the CCP Dialogue with World Political Parties.[13] In doing so, Xi called for countries to reject universalist principles and “refrain from imposing their own values and models on others.” All three initiatives introduced by Xi sought to appeal to the concerns and sensitivities of other developing countries. And they all were framed to provide an unsubtle contrast between China’s benevolence and America’s bullying and willingness to trample on others’ cultures and interests in pursuit of preserving its primacy. Beyond drawing a contrast with the United States, the concrete goals and resources devoted to these initiatives remain unclear. In this respect, the early period of these initiatives bears similarities to the roll-out of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). In its first two years, the BRI also was dismissed as a slogan in search of a strategy. Nevertheless, over time, these three initiatives may mature to serve a few functions that Beijing considers valuable, much as the BRI has done. First, the initiatives offer an opportunity to promote a China-centric set of principles for governing global challenges while avoiding direct confrontation with the United States. Second, they offer China a less expensive alternative for remaining visible overseas than by continuing to fund large infrastructure projects through the BRI at a time when China’s national debt levels are rising. Beijing also is working to elevate the importance of groupings in which it has membership and Washington does not. This includes the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) grouping. Beijing would like to see the BRICS expand and serve as an economic and political force that can counterbalance the Western-dominated G-7 grouping. Beijing chafes at the strategic weight that the G-7 holds and would like to dilute its influence. Although Beijing secured its goal in expanding the membership of BRICS at the grouping’s annual summit on August 24, 2023, it remains to be seen whether any substantive impacts will result from the symbolic step of inviting more members to join. Another grouping that Beijing favors and would like to elevate in importance is the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). The SCO grew with the addition of Iran on July 4, 2023. It also has plans for Belarus to accede to membership, which will expand the geographic reach of the organization.[14] Even so, the SCO will remain limited in its capacity to serve as an anti-Western bloc for several reasons. First, there are significant divisions among existing members, including India and Pakistan, which impede efforts to forge an ambitious agenda. Second, the organization has a weak Secretariat and lacks institutional bureaucratic capacity. Third, multiple American allies and partners are involved as dialogue partners, thus reducing the likelihood of the group taking a hard anti-Western turn. As a result, the SCO will remain more of a talk shop than a Chinese answer to American security partnerships in the region. Probing for Soft Spots China’s foreign policy strategy for breaking out of its feeling of encirclement under U.S. and Western pressure is omnidirectional and opportunistic. Beijing is not sequentially attempting to first consolidate a sphere of influence in Asia and then expand its global influence. In fact, Beijing has more room for maneuver outside of Asia, including in Central Asia, Africa, and in specific thematic areas than it does within Asia. These less contested spaces have been a focus of China’s foreign policy over the past year. Xi convened the inaugural China-Central Asia Summit on May 18-19 in the historic Silk Road terminus of Xi’an. The summit included the leaders of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Xi promised billions of dollars in contributions to poverty reduction, food security, and green development. He also urged greater regional connectivity, including in the energy sector.[15] China imports more than two-thirds of its pipeline gas from the region.[16] With Russia increasingly consumed by its invasion of Ukraine, Beijing seems to be exploiting an opening to expand its diplomatic share of the region’s focus and prioritization. Beijing has made a similar concerted push to deepen its ties with African nations. In so doing, Chinese leaders have pushed a narrative that China and African nations are natural partners based on their shared history of Western repression and their shared development goals. During his annual January trip to the region, former Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang stressed that “Africa should",2018-2021,22,high_conflict
137,2021,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/forecasting-chinas-strategy-in-the-middle-east-over-the-next-four-years/,en,"This piece is part of a series titled “The future of U.S.-China policy: Recommendations for the incoming administration” from Brookings’s John L. Thornton China Center. In the past two decades, China has rapidly emerged as an increasingly consequential economic, political, and security actor in the Middle East. China is the largest consumer of Middle Eastern oil, Chinese trade with the region has more than tripled over the past 20 years, and China is playing an expanding role in regional peace, security, and diplomacy. Beijing’s strategy in the Middle East has emphasized a comprehensive plan to expand its influence in almost all key domains. The next four years will be essential to China’s acceleration of its political, economic, and diplomatic engagement in the Middle East, with a strong focus on diversifying economic ties, involvement in peace and mediation, and managing a regional power equilibrium that has shifted as the result of the war in Gaza. Continued dependence on Middle Eastern oil When China assesses the Middle East in its global strategy, its foremost national interest always lies in energy security. As China is heavily dependent on energy imports, the Middle East is an inevitable and indispensable partner for China. In 2022, about 53% of China’s crude oil imports came from the Middle East. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, China’s crude oil imports hit a record high of 11.3 million barrels per day in 2023, growing by 10% compared to the previous year. Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, and Iran (through Malaysia), occupy top positions in China’s energy import portfolio. To ensure its energy security, China has worked carefully to avoid overdependence on a single country. According to conversations I had with Chinese experts in October 2024, the Chinese foreign policy community’s conventional wisdom is that China should not import more than 20% of its crude oil from any single country, regardless of whether it is Russia or Saudi Arabia. However, the deliberate avoidance of dependence on a single country does not remove China’s dependence on the Middle East as a region. Despite China’s commitment to carbon neutrality and a green transition, the diversification of China’s energy portfolio is unlikely to affect China’s dependence on Middle Eastern oil for the next four years. China intends to peak carbon emissions by 2030, which means that it will still be expanding its carbon emissions in 2029. As China prioritizes reducing coal in its overall energy consumption, oil and gas are seen as “cleaner” alternatives. In other words, even if China intends to reduce carbon emissions, coal, rather than oil and gas, is the priority for reductions. This is why the percentage of coal in China’s overall energy consumption decreased from 68.5% to 55.3% from 2012 to 2021, while the percentage of oil increased from 17% to 18%. China’s dependence on Middle Eastern hydrocarbons has two immediate implications: first, China has to protect stable energy production in the region, and second, China has to protect the safe transportation of energy from the region to China. These two priorities ensure that any conflict that affects or disrupts the production or transportation of China’s oil shipments will not be in China’s national interest. China’s strategy in the Middle East during the incoming Trump administration will be heavily vested in the maintenance of oil production and shipment. Diversifying economic engagement The final impact of the war in Gaza on the region’s future is unknown, but several trajectories of China’s strategy in the Middle East will accelerate regardless. First, China’s expansion and diversification of economic ties in the region will deepen in non-energy sectors. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that China’s economic relations with the Middle East completely hinge upon the energy trade, China’s exports to the region reached nearly $229 billion in 2022, while imports exceeded $278 billion. The top commodity China exports to the region is machinery and parts, while its imports primarily consist of natural resources. This signifies that the Middle East has become an important market for China, and that China will look to have the region absorb Chinese overcapacity by increasing its exports. In addition, China is diving into the development of infrastructure, new and clean energy, the digital economy, and artificial intelligence (AI) in the Middle East while aligning China’s own strategies such as the Belt and Road Initiative with local Middle Eastern blueprints like Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030. In the next four years, China will further saturate the Middle East with its economic presence, including not only trade in goods but also in services. In recent years, Chinese AI companies have been actively building partnerships to expand their market access in the Middle East. Digital technology cooperation between China and regional countries is likely to be the most impactful. Trajectory of relations with key countries The Gaza crisis has put China’s traditional balancing diplomacy in the region to a serious stress test. Until 2023, China had been able to maintain relationships with all parties in the region, between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and between the Arab world and Israel relatively well. This strategic flexibility was made possible by China’s relatively detached position and lack of entanglement with regional powers. However, the Gaza crisis has demonstrated the limitation of China’s balancing diplomacy. With the shifts and uncertainty associated with the regional power equilibrium, China’s balancing diplomacy will have to adapt. First, many in China see the Gaza crisis as a temporary setback for the reconciliation process between Israel and the Arab countries, and that eventually, normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia will occur. China does not necessarily see itself as a benefactor of such normalization because a security pact between the United States and Saudi Arabia, a precondition for Israel-Saudi normalization, will undermine China’s efforts to shape a new regional security architecture with less U.S. involvement and influence. China does not yet have critical influence over Saudi Arabia’s strategic alignment choice. Nevertheless, China is likely to use its energy, economic, and political engagement to neutralize the impact of the Saudi-U.S. defense agreement, particularly if such a pact includes clauses that hinder security and technological cooperation between China and Saudi Arabia. It means China will prioritize building leverage and enhancing ties with Saudi Arabia (as well as other key Arab states) to balance their deepened security ties with the United States. China has been pushing against a U.S.-led regional security organization or mechanism—what the Chinese have termed a “Middle Eastern NATO.” Although China’s nascent and superficial security involvement in the region means that this process is occurring largely independently from China, it does not stop China from working to influence it. Similarly, it will be important for China to support Iran’s efforts to regain its strength and prestige after the latter has taken a heavy toll from Israel’s attacks on its regional proxies, including Hamas and Hezbollah. China would like to see a regional security architecture anchored on a balance of power, with Iran as a strong pillar and as China’s partner in countering U.S. dominance in the region’s security affairs. Thus, Iran’s weakening is not conducive to this approach. China signed a 25-year blueprint on economic engagement with Iran in 2021, but the progress in investment and economic cooperation has been lacking. Moving forward, China may prioritize rebuilding Tehran’s strength to preserve the region’s balance of power. That could entail more imports of Iranian crude oil, more investment in Iran’s infrastructure, and support for Iran’s regional approach. China remains concerned about the threat of U.S. sanctions, but such support from Beijing could transpire in a relatively less political manner such as through illicit trade, development aid, and diplomatic support. Beijing denies the existence of an “axis of evil” with Russia, North Korea, and Iran, but privately, Chinese officials recognize that these countries share more convictions and interests in international politics with China than China does with the United States. This sentiment could potentially heighten if U.S.-China relations enter another “freefall” under the second Trump administration. In all, China will not let Tehran fail, particularly because Beijing’s relationship with Tehran would presumably help balance Saudi Arabia’s pursuit of relationships with the United States and Israel. Navigating a difficult relationship with Israel China’s relationship with Israel suffered the most from the war in Gaza. China has refused to define Hamas as a terrorist organization and has been almost unequivocally critical of Israel and the “humanitarian disaster” it created in Gaza since the beginning of the crisis. The key caveat is not that China adopted a pro-Palestine position, but rather that China adopted an anti-U.S. position in the Gaza crisis. Because Beijing sees Israel as America’s closest ally in the region, China’s default position is to counter the positions of the United States and its allies. Had Israel’s alliance with the United States not been a factor, China’s position toward the Gaza crisis would likely have followed Beijing’s traditional balancing act. In the Chinese policy community, it is widely acknowledged that Israel is the “victim” of U.S.-China great power competition coming to China’s policy toward the war in Gaza. The challenge is how Beijing will manage its relationship with Israel beyond the Gaza crisis. Some in Beijing are seriously concerned about some Israeli voices who call for Israel to develop relations with Taiwan as retaliation against China’s pro-Palestine position. An Israeli parliamentary delegation visited Taiwan in April 2024, and Taiwan’s possible role in Israel’s pager attacks against Hezbollah has brought keen attention to the previously quiet military relations between Israel and Taiwan. Few in China actually believe that Israel will pursue diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but the evolving relationship evidently has ramifications for China and its top priority of the “One China” principle. The trajectory of the China-Israel relationship in the next four years will be a key question for China’s Middle East strategy. China does not have a fundamental conflict of national interests with Israel, and their deteriorating relations today are a consequence of the Israel-Palestine conflict rather than a direct clash between China and Israel. Therefore, given China’s tradition of balancing diplomacy in the Middle East, China will foreseeably want to repair damaged ties with Israel through a diverse range of engagements. This will be particularly true and occur expediently if the Gaza crisis ends and if some level of reconciliation is achieved between Israel and Saudi Arabia. But there are also counterfactors. The Gaza war has disillusioned Israelis who previously romanticized their country’s relationship with China, as Israel had hoped for China to adopt a more sympathetic and supportive attitude toward Israel’s position. A sense of betrayal, a resentment of China’s position, and emotional reactions to China’s repeated criticisms will make it exceedingly difficult to convince the Israeli people that China is neutral and trustworthy again. Pragmatism might prevail in the end, but it could take more than four years for things to renormalize.

139,2021,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/mobilizing-the-indo-pacific-infrastructure-response-to-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-in-southeast-asia/,en,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY China has become a significant financier of major infrastructure projects in Southeast Asia under the banner of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). This has prompted renewed interest in the sustainable infrastructure agenda in Southeast Asia from other major powers. In response, the United States, Japan, and Australia are actively seeking to coordinate their own revamped overseas infrastructure efforts as part of a trilateral arrangement aimed at upholding a free and open Indo-Pacific. Though principally motivated by geostrategic concerns, such international policy efforts are also well-justified on economic grounds — given the persistence of Southeast Asia’s large infrastructure financing gap, low world interest rates, and concerns about structurally weak global economic growth. In addition, China’s approach to infrastructure poses clear risks to governance, as well as economic, environmental, and social sustainability in the region. Finally, at the time of writing, the COVID-19 virus has unleashed a global health and economic pandemic of enormous proportions. Policymakers are currently focused on containing the health and economic damage of the virus. However, as the priority shifts to the post-crisis recovery, this inevitably will see focus return to the sustainable infrastructure agenda — with Southeast Asian governments looking for willing partners to assist. The current approach of the trilateral partners, however, is likely to fall short in its ambition to provide a credible response to China’s BRI. The present emphasis on mobilizing more private capital for infrastructure development cannot deliver the kind of dividends needed to compete with the scale of China’s BRI. Nor is an emphasis on high infrastructure standards likely to deter Southeast Asian governments from taking on Chinese projects as long as China continues to be perceived as offering faster, less risk-averse, and more responsive support compared to alternatives available from traditional partners. This policy brief makes several practical recommendations that would allow the trilateral partners to compete more effectively with China while simultaneously promoting more sustainable development outcomes. This includes increasing efforts to expand the pool of bankable projects and providing technical assistance to help Southeast Asian governments to better manage any BRI projects they might take on — particularly via the multilateral development banks, which can act as politically neutral technical arbiters. Meanwhile, the trilateral partners need to improve the competitiveness of their own infrastructure approaches to be more streamlined, less risk-averse, and more fit-for-purpose. This could be a useful part of the agenda for the new Blue Dot Network. More ambition is also needed. Contrary to the assumption that it impossible to match China’s financing scale, estimates presented in this policy brief suggest that the gap is not that large — implying the trilateral partners can indeed keep pace if they are willing to direct adequate budgetary resources to the task. Finally, Australia is currently the only trilateral partner without access to the full range of development financing instruments and should consider options for addressing this gap in its capabilities.

140,2021,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/performance-will-determine-prestige-in-us-china-geopolitical-competition/,en,"A JOURNAL OF THE EAST ASIA FOUNDATION GO TO WWW.KEAF.ORG Articles Performance Will Determine Prestige in US-China Geopolitical Competition By Ryan Hass The era of US-China “great-power competition” began at the end of the Barack Obama administration and gained intensity throughout the Donald Trump administration. It now has become common to hear Cold War analogies to understand the nature of US-China relations. But such comparisons are misplaced. At the same time, the US and China remain deeply interconnected and are competing within a single international system. Any effort to revive a “containment strategy” holds little purchase anywhere in the world. Although the risk of conflict remains deadly serious, the military domain is not likely to be where competition will be adjudicated. Instead, the crux of competition will be over which governance, social, and economic system will prove capable of outperforming the other. Both countries are striving through words and deeds to burnish an image of themselves as the power best poised to lead in the 21st century. At the same time, US-China competition is occurring against a backdrop of rising global challenges, including climate change, pandemics, mass migration, food and energy insecurity, and widening social inequality. These challenges will shape the contours of US-China competition. They may also present opportunities for Washington and/or Beijing to flex global leadership muscle by demonstrating capacity to deliver solutions. Ultimately, neither side will be capable of imposing its will over the other at acceptable cost or risk. Instead, each side will seek to outpace and outperform the other as part of a long-term geopolitical contest for recognition as the world’s leading power. Prestige will derive from performance. Understanding the Current Moment: Intensifying Geopolitical Competition The US-China relationship during the latter years of the Obama administration was characterized by steadily rising strategic competition. This competition was concentrated in — but not isolated to — the Asia-Pacific. Tensions around regional flashpoints such as the South China Sea, the East China Sea, and Taiwan all rose during this period. There also was growing friction in the cyber domain, mutual wariness of each other’s space ambitions, and mutual concerns about each side’s efforts to harness new and emerging technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence, autonomous weapons systems, life sciences and quantum computing) for strategic advantage. Then US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter captured the cumulative intensification of these trends with his introduction of the term “great power competition” to describe relations between the world’s two most capable powers.1 This intensification of competition was obscured somewhat during that period by at least three factors. First, there was a dense architecture of diplomatic interaction that pushed both countries into direct dialogue with each other on a near daily basis. This density of interaction dampened pressure for escalation of tensions, since there frequently was an opportunity to raise concerns and clarify intentions without having to resort to military signaling or public condemnation to register objections. Second, both sides pursued efforts to bound competition in areas that were largely zero-sum in nature. There were, for example, efforts to establish rules of behavior for air and maritime encounters between both countries’ military platforms in international waters and airspace. There also were deliberate efforts to deal directly with differences on cyber issues, and to address concerns through diplomatic channels over cross-Strait and other sensitive matters. Third, both sides sought to co-ordinate efforts to address common global challenges. For example, in the wake of the 2008-09 global financial crisis, US and Chinese economic officials synchronized policy actions to restore global growth. US and Chinese scientists and health workers stood together on the front lines of the fight against Ebola. And in the run-up to the Paris climate summit, US and Chinese leaders and climate negotiators jointly pushed other countries to embrace a global accord. As a consequence, the US-China relationship of early 2017 was broadly perceived to be tense, but not teetering on the brink of runaway competition. Five years later, the picture has changed markedly. Talk of a “new Cold War” has now become cliché. The competitive space of the relationship has become nearly all-encompassing, covering diplomacy, development, technology, values, and military domains. In many of these areas, the competition increasingly has come to be viewed as zero-sum, with China’s gains being interpreted as America’s losses, and vice versa. With uneven consistency, the Trump administration pursued an ideological approach toward China. The Trump team sought to generate opposition to any developments that would make the world more receptive to China’s governance system or its major initiatives, such as the Belt and Road Initiative and Huawei’s attempts to corner the market on 5G build-out. China’s actions and rhetoric during this period generated a tailwind for the Trump administration’s efforts to constrain China. From its suppression of dissent to its crackdown in Hong Kong, its repression in Xinjiang, its threats against South China Sea claimants, its drawing of blood at the Sino-Indian border, its hostage diplomacy with Canada, its removal of term limits for China’s top leader, its roiling of relations with Australia, its tightening squeeze on Taiwan, and its adoption of a sharp nationalist edge in its diplomatic conduct around the world, China’s actions alerted the world to the need to protect against negative externalities from its rise. The Biden administration inherited these trend-lines. They accepted that China’s overall pattern of conduct would not offer many near-term opportunities to moderate tension in the overall relationship. Chinese leaders’ triumphal rhetoric about the “rise of the east and decline of the west” and President Xi Jinping’s assertion that “time and momentum are on China’s side” during the early months of the Biden administration effectively foreclosed opportunities for a moderation in tensions.2 At the same time, the Biden team also understood that embarking on a strategy of unvarnished ideological confrontation would carry two risks. First, it would alienate allies and partners, whose buy-in for greater co-ordination in dealing with challenges posed by China they deemed vital to the effectiveness of their strategy. Washington views such co-ordination as a competitive advantage, since Beijing lacks meaningful international partners. Most American allies and partners in Europe and Asia have their own specific concerns about China’s conduct that overlap with US concerns on a case-by-case basis, but none presently appear open to entering an anti-China bloc to contain China or constrain its rise. Second, the Biden team recognized that an overly ideological framing would inhibit prospects for US-China co-ordination on shared global challenges, such as climate change, global economic recovery and pandemic disease control. It also would limit co-ordination on security challenges, such as halting Iran’s nuclear program and limiting North Korea’s nuclear expansion. Seeing little room for moving toward a more constructive US-China relationship but not wanting to do lasting damage, the Biden team used their first months to prioritize efforts to address America’s domestic crises and to restore a favorable balance of power in East Asia. Throughout its first year, the Biden administration sought, albeit unevenly, to maintain connectivity with China’s leadership, viewing such efforts as necessary to control the temperature in the relationship and avoid unwanted escalation. The Nature of US-China Geopolitical Competition The US and China are both central powers within a single global system — and they compete for leadership in virtually every domain within that system. Both sides recognize the dense connectivity that binds them together within the existing system (e.g., supply chains, financial flows, knowledge production, scientific exchanges, ecological interdependence, etc.). Even as each side seeks to limit vulnerabilities from dependence on the other, neither side views it as plausible to disentangle entirely from the other at tolerable cost or risk. In addition, neither side views it as possible to overcome challenges from the other through the use of force. While the risk of conflict remains real, particularly over Taiwan contingencies, it is not the plan for either country to employ force against the other to achieve its national ambitions. Any conflict between the US and China would mark the first war in human history between two nuclear-armed countries with high-end cyber and space capabilities as well as globe-spanning long-range strike capacity. There is little reason for confidence that either country would be able to control escalation or keep a conflict localized. Any such conflict likely would bring about immense devastation for both countries and for the global economy but would not likely deliver a clean winner and loser. Given America’s and China’s national identities as singular powers, it is unlikely that either would accept receiving a bloody nose and then retreat behind their national borders to nurse their wounds. Unlike during the Cold War, there will not be neatly demarcated international blocs led by the US and China. As Singaporean scholar Bilahari Kausikan has observed, “Few countries are likely to consider it wise — or even feasible — to neatly and permanently align all their interests across all domains with one or the other. The result will be greater fluidity and complexity in international relationships. On certain issues, some countries will tilt one way. On other issues, they will lean the other way.”3 At the same time, both the US and China are deepening their respective diplomatic, economic, development, and public health engagements on every continent. Both countries now are the two major actors in virtually every corner of the world. Neither are prepared to cede any region to the other. Nor are they prepared to risk conflict by pursuing a closed sphere of influence anywhere that excludes the other. Given these circumstances — the US and China residing within a single system, both deeply interconnected, neither capable of imposing its will on the other through threat or use of military force, and neither capable of mobilizing a bloc to counter the other — both sides will be pushed to find opportunities to gain relative advantage over the other in long-term competition. This is where the bulk of both countries’ efforts are likely to be focused for the coming decades. Beijing would like to seed a narrative that China enjoys momentum and will continue to rise. It wants to be perceived as being guided by scientific judgments about how best to control Covid-19 and combat climate change. China’s leaders also want their country to be seen as the principal engine for global economic growth and the most important source of investment and know-how for tackling the world’s infrastructure bottleneck. They would like to benefit by contrast with the US through their involvement in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and their desire to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) trade accord, while the US pursues self-imposed isolation from regional economic integration trends. For its part, the US sees its relative advantages as residing in its resilience at home, its innovative capability, its global network of allies and partners and its ability to rally efforts to address global challenges. The Biden team’s early focus has been on controlling the spread of Covid-19 at home, serving as the “arsenal of Covid-19 vaccines” for the ",2018-2021,18,high_conflict

From batteries to solar panels to rare-earth metals used in wind turbines, technologies that over the past decade have cratered in cost and surged in scale – thanks to innovation supported by both Washington and Beijing – are targets in yet another trans-Pacific trade fight. But investing in innovative green machines at home is only one way to affect the climate, and setting protectionist industrial policy is only one way to boost geopolitical power. At least as important to the planet is the money the United States and China spend on financing infrastructure in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) — infrastructure that will lock in high or low carbon-emission pathways for decades. Never has it been more crucial that the two countries, even as they vie for supremacy in low-carbon innovation, support each other’s efforts to decarbonize their respective infrastructure finance flows. China bankrolls more infrastructure in EMDEs than any other country. But much of that infrastructure has been dirty. According to a Boston University database, Chinese companies and so-called policy banks – large government-affiliated institutions – have financed 648 power plants in 92 countries.1 Of those plants’ collective power-generation capacity, more than 50% burn fossil fuel, and 34% burn the dirtiest sort of fossil fuel: coal. But China, facing criticism and sensing shifting economics, has pledged to change that. In November 2021, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared that his country “will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad.”2 Today, more than a year later, China must make good on that pledge through deep, structural changes to its political economy; otherwise, changes in its outbound investment will not take hold. China’s task is daunting, threatening some of the biggest companies in China and thus in the world. It is even more intimidating because it looms at a time of perilous animosity between Washington and Beijing, evidenced by military brinkmanship over Taiwan, tit-for-tat trade barriers on products ranging from computer chips to solar panels, and superpower shadowboxing over Russia’s war in Ukraine. Yet China’s decarbonization of its foreign infrastructure finance is existentially important — for the planet, the Chinese economy, and U.S. citizens and firms. Contrary to the zero-sum view toward China that constitutes conventional wisdom in Washington, the winning strategy for the United States is not merely to try to eclipse China as an international financier of green infrastructure. The United States is trying to do that, notably through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, a plan the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden and its G-7 allies announced last June to boost infrastructure investment in EMDEs, in large part to fight climate change. That effort was conceived broadly as a geopolitical counter to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China’s decade-old infrastructure- and market-building campaign across the Global South, and to the BRI’s newer sibling, China’s Global Development Initiative (GDI).3 To be sure, a greening of U.S. and G-7 infrastructure investment abroad is needed and welcome. But it is insufficient. The smart strategy for the United States, even as it decarbonizes its own outbound infrastructure finance, is to encourage maximal greening of China’s massive infrastructure investment abroad — and to leverage that Chinese spending to create new opportunities for export-focused U.S. firms in a decarbonizing world. - Acknowledgements and disclosures The author would like to thank Samantha Gross and Louison Sall for discussions related to this paper, Lori Merritt for editing, and Rachel Slattery for layout. - Footnotes - Cecilia Springer, “Understanding China’s Global Power: 2022 Update,” (Boston, MA: Boston University, October 2022), https://www.bu.edu/gdp/2022/10/19/understanding-chinas-global-power-2022-update/#:~:text=A%20new%20policy%20brief%20summarizes,entire%20country%20of%20Spain%20or. - Somini Sengupta and Rick Gladstone, “China Pledges to Stop Building Coal-Burning Power Plants Abroad,” The New York Times, September 21, 2021, https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/climate/china-power-plants-coal.html. - “Fact Sheet: President Biden and G7 Leaders Formally Launch the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment,” The White House, June 26, 2022, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/26/fact-sheet-president-biden-and-g7-leaders-formally-launch-the-partnership-for-global-infrastructure-and-investment/.

The Strategy Group Members welcome your comments and questions. Please submit via this form. I. Report Overview A group of experts and former government officials from Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) and the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP) convened strategists from the United States and Europe over the past year to discuss the crisis in the transatlantic relationship and to propose a strategy to revive and strengthen it. We Europeans and Americans launched this project due to our shared commitment to the transatlantic relationship. We met throughout 2020—first in Munich and Berlin and then virtually during the pandemic—to develop a truly transatlantic fusion of ideas and strategy. This comprehensive report and eight individual action plans lay out an ambitious agenda for tackling challenges to the transatlantic community. The action plan issue areas are as follows: - Economics and Trade - Security and Defense - China - Russia - Energy Policy and Climate Change - Democracy - Technology - Middle East and North Africa Each action plan includes an in-depth assessment of key challenges and proposes recommendations to U.S., Canadian and European policymakers. Where significant disagreements exist between the U.S. and Europe, we outline the debate and propose solutions for how they can be resolved. II. Executive Summary The United States, Europe and Canada must work together toward one ambition in 2021—to renew, revitalize and retool for the decade ahead the most powerful democratic community in modern history. With the election of Joe Biden, Europe and Canada will once again have a committed Atlanticist as their American partner. After years of mistrust, recrimination and division, the bridge across the Atlantic should be “built back better” and we must do that together. But it would be a dangerous mistake to think that the result of the American election alone will repair the breach. The U.S. and Europe cannot simply rebuild the ties of a previous era if we are to succeed in meeting today’s challenges. The world has not stood still: a more confident China, an aggressive Russia, resurgent authoritarianism and the existential threat of climate change present the U.S. and Europe with new and grave challenges. The transatlantic relationship must be rebuilt and reimagined. Our institutions must be strengthened. As the U.S. embraces its allies again, Europe too must rethink its approach to some fundamental issues. The task is urgent. The world needs a more powerful and purposeful transatlantic alliance to drive a new global agenda. By traditional measurements, the U.S. and European Union are the world’s two largest economies. But China will likely overtake them in this decade. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) remains the world’s strongest military alliance but is falling behind technologically. Our joint capacity in science, research and digital technologies is unrivaled—for now. A renewed transatlantic commitment to human freedom and democracy is needed to safeguard the future we seek for our children and grandchildren. With vision and hard work, a “New Deal” for the transatlantic community is possible, joining in common action a more globally committed America with a more self-reliant and capable Europe to meet the challenges to our health, security, prosperity and way of life. This new compact must begin with an immediate ceasefire across our own lines, ending, on all sides, aggressive rhetoric, punitive economic sanctions and exclusionary regulatory measures. We must also harness our joint power to deter a more confident and aggressive China and a cynical and disruptive Russia. They have exploited transatlantic tensions for too long. Together, we must oppose their illiberal agendas in Europe, Africa, the Indo-Pacific and around the world. This is Europe’s challenge as much as America’s. We Europeans and Americans have come together under the auspices of Harvard Kennedy School and the German Council on Foreign Relations to produce this strategic plan for a renewal of the transatlantic community to which we all remain deeply committed. We believe Europe and the U.S. will be “stronger together” in meeting common threats and advancing democratic values in the world than operating at cross purposes from each other. To do so, we must rededicate ourselves to three strategic goals for the year ahead: - Rebuild the bonds of trust at the heart of our alliance and revitalize our democracies; - Commit to a joint strategy to meet global challenges and defend liberalism; and - Transform our political, military, technological and economic capacity to be the most effective force for freedom and rules-based order in a challenging world. We recommend to our governments and to the 800 million Europeans, Canadians and Americans who comprise our alliance the following priority objectives: - Rebuild the bonds of trust at the heart of our alliance and revitalize our democracies The commitment to liberal democracy is the heart of the transatlantic community. But we must do better to repair and strengthen democracy at home against internal and external threats even as we defend it abroad. - The transatlantic nations should reaffirm at NATO and U.S.–European Union Summits in early 2021 the key commitments that have bound us together for decades—Article 5 of NATO’s Washington Treaty; our shared support for a strong, globally oriented European Union; and a United Kingdom with the will and capacity to act around the world. - We must strengthen the legitimacy of our democracies in an age of systemic competition by ensuring our governments are more responsive to our citizens and address the problems of income inequality, inclusion, and racism. - We must also roll back authoritarian tendencies within our region, including in Hungary, Poland and Turkey, by conditioning NATO security investment funds and EU financial support. We must be as rigorous with ourselves in defending democracy as we are with Moscow and Beijing. - We must defend democracy and human rights more assertively around the world, countering the spread of Russian and Chinese-style authoritarianism. - Commit to a joint strategy to meet global challenges and defend liberalism We will be more effective by adopting common policies on key global challenges. Priority issues are: The Pandemic: - Europe, Canada and the U.S. should join forces to ensure equitable access to vaccines, to support and strengthen COVAX and the World Health Organization (WHO), and to create health security stockpiles and expertise banks for the benefit of all our citizens. Economic Recovery and Innovation: - Our governments should align fiscal and monetary stimulus and infrastructure investments to renew middle class growth for the fastest possible recovery; lead the G-7 and G-20 in protecting free and fair trade and open markets and regulating financial instruments and innovation to favor transparency and global equity. - All transatlantic states should remove unnecessary tariffs and punitive regulatory measures directed at each other and commit to working jointly to strengthen the World Trade Organization (WTO). Security and Defense: - NATO should strengthen its capacity to contain and deter Russia in all domains. The alliance should also make its troop deployments and rotations permanent in Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as in Romania and Bulgaria. - The U.S. should overturn the mistaken decision to draw down U.S. forces from Germany, and only reallocate forces within Europe in close consultation with allies. - All NATO allies should meet their pledge to spend 2% of GDP on defense by 2024; this should be linked to a major capabilities drive in both NATO and the EU, including greater investment in cyber defense and offense, Artificial Intelligence (AI), quantum, and nano- and biotechnologies. - In Afghanistan, NATO should maintain its “in together, out together” policy, tying troop reductions to concrete progress in the intra-Afghan peace negotiations, while keeping our commitments to the Afghan citizens, government and military. China: - The transatlantic nations should join forces with Japan and other democracies to present a united front in trade negotiations with China and at the WTO. - We should harden our security against a predatory China by strengthening and harmonizing investment screening mechanisms, instituting targeted export controls to protect critical infrastructure and technologies, including barring Huawei from our 5G networks, and increasing intelligence sharing. - We should oppose China’s illegal grab for power and territory in the South and East China Sea region at the United Nations and urge stronger legal measures in international courts. - We should condemn and sanction China’s massive violations of human rights and freedom in Hong Kong, against the Uighur population and elsewhere. Russia: - The transatlantic nations should expand joint efforts to stop Russia’s malign election interference, disinformation campaigns and cyber espionage and sabotage, and oppose Moscow’s destabilizing behavior in Ukraine, Belarus, in other European countries and in the Middle East. - All U.S., Canadian, UK and EU sanctions on Russia must be maintained unless and until Moscow changes course. - The U.S. should extend the New START Treaty for a limited period, linked to Moscow’s commitment to engage seriously in comprehensive nuclear and conventional arms control negotiations. Climate Change and Clean Energy: - The transatlantic community should accelerate and integrate U.S., UK, Canadian and EU initiatives to “build back greener” and reduce carbon emissions; support joint research and development of green technologies; and drive more ambitious global targets at the COP26 in Glasgow. - Most of our group members believe that the Nord Stream 2 project and the sanctions on it should be suspended by mutual agreement early in 2021. We all believe the U.S. and EU must work out our differences on this controversial project amicably and without public threats. We must also revitalize consultations to strengthen diversity, redundancy and resilience in Europe’s energy supply. Digital Technology and Regulation: - The transatlantic community should join forces to ensure a free and fair digital future that protects our citizens and government systems from malign influences, state surveillance and monopolistic practices. - Together, we should craft a common approach to digital tax policy. A 12-month truce on member state tax plans and resumed negotiations at the Organization for Co-operation and Development (OECD) are necessary. Regulatory, competition, content and privacy challenges should be addressed in close coordination; and we should jointly set standards to shape global norms and block authoritarian and malign practices. - We should also strengthen network security by building stronger internal controls on investments in strategic industries and technologies and by blocking Chinese and other unsecure investments in critical technologies. Iran: - The U.S. and Europe should lead with diplomacy in seeking to end Iran’s nuclear weapons ambitions and ballistic missile program. The U.S. should rejoin the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) P5+1 negotiation framework with Iran if it agrees to return to all the restrictions on its nuclear program in the 2015 agreement. - In addition, any new set of agreements must be stronger, deeper, more verifiable and of longer duration. Most members of the group think they should address Iran’s ballistic and cruise missile programs. - Together, we should stand united against Iran’s regional aggression and support for terrorism in Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East. - Transform our political, military, technological and economic capacity to be the most effective force for freedom and rules-based",2018-2021,28,high_conflict
143,2021,brookings,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-new-geopolitics-of-fragility-russia-china-and-the-mounting-challenge-for-peacebuilding/,en,"Executive Summary During the Cold War, the conflicts of the “Third World” were viewed by the superpowers as a terrain for competition, often in the form of proxy wars that turned those countries into some of the great killing fields of modern history. Then, for the two decades that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall, wars in every region in the world declined, by every measure. Notwithstanding the current focus on the failures of U.S.-led wars in the wider Middle East, this decline in levels of war was in large part due to successful efforts at peacebuilding, led by the Western nations. Now, that progress is at risk. The West faces stiff competition for influence in development policy in general, and in fragile states specifically. Competing investments from foreign interests in fragile states can undermine countries’ long term economic and financial sustainability, while ill-conceived security support arrangements can weaken the governance of the security and justice sector in these countries. All while mounting tensions at the United Nations Security Council and other global and regional institutions reduce or impede the international community’s ability to prevent the escalations of conflict and support accountability. There’s long been competition at the regional level in fragile states, but as fragility has spread across the Middle East, that dynamic has brought in more influential, more capable regional actors — like Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates. What’s more, Russia and China have increased their engagement both at the global policy level and in specific fragile states. These countries, and the West, all adopt different strategies and approaches based on their capabilities and strategic economic and security interests — often, in deep contradiction with one another. The core of Russia’s strategy in these cases is disruption; China has a more elaborate strategy that defined by longer-term economic and security interests. It is vital for China to open market and investments opportunities while building up its security in the Pacific, and to ensure secure trading routes. Beijing puts considerable resources behind its strategy, as the very ambitious Belt and Road Initiative illustrates. Countries like Turkey, Iran, and Saudi Arabia have more regional ambitions that are connected to their own security, ideological views, and economic opportunism. In the Indo-Pacific, Japan, Australia, and increasingly India are also playing an active role in fragile states, in part to try to fence off China’s ambitions. This dynamic creates a huge risk for fragile states, as they become an arena for geopolitical competition. Many of the careful and progressive approaches to peace building and improvement of governance and accountability that the West has elaborated over the last two decades are very much put into question by this situation. The relatively weak commitment of the West for implementing fragility-specific approaches is also part of the problem. Western nations need to rapidly mobilize to address these risks that could easily increase fragility and create more conflicts. They should put concerted pressure within multilateral institutions for the “new” powers to improve the quality and accountability of their interventions. And the West should improve its own coordination and effectiveness, and back strong multilateral partnerships — with the involvement of regional powers where they are willing to collaborate. The alternative is to be pulled back into full-blown proxy wars, at great human cost. This report is being released after the swift fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban in August marked an inglorious end to 20 years of American presence in that country. Events there may feel like a metaphor for a wider phenomenon of shifting Western attention away from fragile states; they should also serve as a cautionary tale.

Today, his business benefits from a shortage of qualified truckers, but not because of China’s global infrastructure development strategy. “The Silk Road has not developed for us,” Durakovic told Nikkei Asia. “First it was Covid, then it was the Ukraine war, so the boom is no longer about Silk Road logistics.” Duisburg, a city of half a million people, is located in Germany’s industrial heartland at the junction of the Rhine and Ruhr rivers. A downturn in the country’s steel and coal industries in the 1990s and early 2000s battered its economy. But the city found a saviour in Chinese president Xi Jinping, who visited Duisburg in 2014 to officially make its inland port Europe’s main Belt and Road hub. While this fuelled anticipation of a new heyday, recent events suggest the prospects are dimming. Much of this stems from the Ukraine war and Germany’s awkward relationship with China. Chancellor Olaf Scholz was the first European leader to visit Beijing after Xi secured a third term as party leader at the Communist party congress in October. But German attitudes have soured recently over China’s cozy relationship with Russia, Taiwan and human rights, as well as Germany’s growing trade deficit with the world’s second-biggest economy. This article is from Nikkei Asia, a global publication with a uniquely Asian perspective on politics, the economy, business and international affairs. Our own correspondents and outside commentators from around the world share their views on Asia, while our Asia300 section provides in-depth coverage of 300 of the biggest and fastest-growing listed companies from 11 economies outside Japan. Germany is currently reviewing its relationship with Beijing, with the unveiling of Berlin’s new basic guidelines for its China policy expected in the next few weeks. Draft excerpts show lawmakers urging a significantly toughened stance and a reduction of economic reliance on China. The more drastic prescriptions include limiting investment in China and stricter monitoring of companies overdependent on China for business. Plans were buried in 2021 for a sprawling China business centre on the banks of the Rhine, from where hundreds of Chinese companies were meant to grow their European distribution networks. In November, Duisburg cited China’s ties with Russia as a reason for letting expire a memorandum of understanding for a sweeping “smart city” project with Chinese tech giant Huawei. Russia’s sudden reduction of natural gas exports to Germany fuelled a notion among German policymakers that it was not a good idea to let critical infrastructure fall into the wrong hands. Around the same time, it became known that Chinese state-owned Cosco Shipping Holdings had in June quietly returned a 30 per cent stake in a €100mn ($108mn) Duisburg port terminal project. “As state-owned Cosco pulls out, other privately owned Chinese logistics players stay engaged, which suggests that Cosco pulled out of the port terminal project over political headwinds,” said Markus Taube, the University Duisburg-Essen’s professor for East Asia economics and China. “That event and the expired Huawei deal nurture doubts among Duisburg’s Chinese business community whether Duisburg still is a good place for them to do business.” The mood has certainly changed since 2011, when the first train on the China Railway Express — an alternative to container shipping — arrived in Duisburg and opened a new chapter in China-Europe land transportation. The line constituted a key part of China’s efforts to entice electronics-makers to move their manufacturing away from China’s coastal provinces to the Chinese inland, where cities are served by the new train services. Data by Duisport, the port’s owner and operator, show that pandemic-related disruptions to maritime trade boosted the Silk Road freight rail business, with the geopolitical upheaval stemming from the Ukraine war causing the opposite. While the annual number of trains rose by 12 per cent to 2,800 in 2021, bookings dropped by about 30 per cent in the spring of 2022, as businesses that adopted rail freight faced reputational, insurance, sanction and confiscation risks along the Russian route. In late 2022, a port spokesman told Nikkei Asia that although momentum has since improved, figures remain below pre-pandemic days — the share of the China-Europe freight rail business in the port’s overall turnover is now 3-4 per cent. Nanjing High Accurate Drive Equipment Manufacturing Group (NGC) in 2015 opened its European headquarters in the city for design, testing, maintenance and refurbishment of gearboxes for wind turbines and industrial equipment. The company cited direct train services between Duisburg and its headquarters in Nanjing as one of the main factors for choosing the city. But one complaint among opposition Duisburg council members is that Chinese companies are not contributing to the local economy. Nikkei Asia’s research of local trade registers suggests that nearly all of the 100 or so Chinese companies that opened bricks-and-mortar presences in Duisburg are engaged in either logistics or cross-border ecommerce. For example, a company with the Germanic-sounding name Hermann Commerce distributes Chinese instant food, soy sauce and food seasonings to more than 20 European countries. Chinese-owned Lisstec markets a cosmetics brand with the similarly Germanic-sounding name Hermuna, which is pitched as “Made in Germany”. But the brand only appears to be available for consumers in China despite the company’s Chinese-language Weibo social media account suggesting its products are made in a German factory for sale in German cosmetics stores and pharmacy chain stores. “The Chinese ecommerce companies that have set up here are not known to be big local job creators or tax contributors,” said Sven Benentreu, the deputy chair of the local chapter of the pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP), an opposition party in Duisburg. “We as the FDP appreciate the presence of Chinese companies here, but the strong China focus of the city government is obviously not paying off as expected,” he added. NGC and the other Chinese-owned companies approached by Nikkei Asia for this article either declined to be interviewed or did not return calls. Kai Yu, director of the China Business Network Duisburg, also declined to be interviewed, just saying in November that “the Chinese managers I know are unavailable, because they have already travelled back to China for the Chinese new year holiday”. China is currently celebrating the lunar new year, two months after Nikkei Asia approached Yu. Chinese students in Duisburg are also not integrating into the city, local academics say. About 2,000 Chinese nationals are enrolled at University Duisburg-Essen, the largest intake among German universities, due mainly to a city partnership signed between Duisburg and Wuhan in 1982 that encouraged academic exchanges. Duisburg’s Chinese student population is concentrated in the streets near the university, where there are a handful of Chinese restaurants and shops. Several part-time student restaurant workers said they mainly came from Shandong province under academic exchange arrangements. “It has always struck me how isolated Duisburg’s Chinese student population is compared to those of other Asian countries, with Chinese community groups effectively shielding new arrivals by assisting in all the initial tasks such as arrangement of accommodation,” said Antonia Hmaidi, an analyst at the China think-tank Merics in Berlin, who previously taught at University Duisburg-Essen. “China’s deteriorating image as an autocratic rival also made China-centred career planning unpopular among German students,” she added. “The relationship with China has become more politicised than a few years ago.” “After the German government releases its new China strategy, the overall climate will probably further worsen, which will probably further cool Duisburg’s business relationship with China.” A version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on January 24, 2023. ©2023 Nikkei Inc.

154,2022,ft,https://www.ft.com/content/e00426f4-8ead-11ea-af59-5283fc4c0cb0,en,"China’s Belt and Road urged to take green route Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. In April, 260 environmental organisations sent an unusual request to China’s finance minister: do not bail out 60 Chinese-backed overseas projects suffering from Covid-19’s economic fallout. The list ranged from coal-fired power plants in Turkey to palm oil plantations in Cameroon, all part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to fund and build infrastructure across Eurasia and beyond. Countries along the route have been calling for debt relief from Beijing in the wake of the global pandemic, but the listed projects should be excluded, due to their environmental, social, or climate risks, wrote the coalition of local civil society organisations and international groups including Friends of Nature. Calls for China’s BRI to shift away from funding polluting infrastructure is fast becoming one of the greatest obstacles to President Xi Jinping’s signature foreign policy programme. Environmentalists argue that the emphasis on fossil fuels is not just dangerous for climate change and local ecology, it is also a bad bet financially, as renewables such as solar and wind become cheaper and more popular. Between 2000 and 2019, Beijing’s two leading policy banks — China Development Bank and Export-Import Bank of China — provided $183bn in energy finance to BRI countries, which went mostly to oil, coal and hydropower. This compares with the banks’ $4.8bn funding for solar and wind projects, according to data from Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center. That imbalance has been highlighted by climate economists, who say the BRI will play a make-or-break role in meeting global targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. A failure to improve environmental standards in 126 BRI-participating countries could push global temperatures up 2.7C, even if all other countries met their targets to reduce emissions, according to a report by Beijing-based Tsinghua Center for Finance and Development, consultancy Vivid Economics and the ClimateWorks Foundation, a non-profit. Polluting projects also face mounting financial and political risks from lawsuits and protests by local activists groups, as well as forecasting failures that have seen some nations overestimate their need for fossil fuel-powered energy production. In a landmark case last June, a court in Kenya ruled on environmental grounds to halt construction of the country’s first coal-fired power station — a $2bn project that had been recognised by China as part of the BRI. Faced with mounting concerns over viability and an economic slowdown at home, China’s overseas energy investments dipped in 2019. Policy banks signed off on three new loans for energy projects worth $3.2bn — the lowest level since 2008. China has increasingly encouraged both international and Chinese commercial banks to finance BRI projects, and green financing initiatives have been launched in an attempt to push financial institutions towards backing low-carbon projects. As part of this effort, the Singapore branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China issued the first green Belt & Road Interbank bond in April last year, worth $2.2bn. But a lack of unified green financing standards is holding back such efforts, according to a report by law firm Baker McKenzie in late 2019. “Until Beijing aligns its principles guiding its environment investments abroad with global standards, it will continue to face international criticism about its lack of sustainable growth and investment strategies,” the report said. Experts also note that Beijing has yet to take policy steps that would make the BRI more environmentally sustainable, such as mandating environmental impact assessments for Chinese companies’ overseas investments — such checks are currently only required within the country. Han Chen, a Zurich-based researcher at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says that an overall shift to cleaner investments in Belt and Road countries will require commitments both from China and from the host nations. Countries must assess their need coal power when renewables might be cheaper, while Chinese institutions could become more transparent about their financing and their commitments to environmental sustainability, Ms Chen says. “Three of Japan’s megabanks have said they are getting out of coal,” she adds. “We haven’t seen that kind of commitment from the Chinese institutions heavily involved in BRI.” Additional reporting by Emma Zhou in Beijing",2022-2025,4,high_conflict

The initiative is one of the biggest development programmes in history. Ten years on, the government is bailing out hundreds of billions of dollars worth of loans to protect its development banks from default. So should the BRI be regarded as a success and what comes next? The FT's James Kynge talks to the Overseas Development Institute's Yunnan Chen Produced and edited by Tom Griggs. Filmed by Rod Fitzgerald. Additional footage by Getty and Reuters Transcript You can enable subtitles (captions) in the video player China this month celebrates the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative, which ranks as the world's biggest development programme ever undertaken by a single country. Over the last 10 years, the BRI, as it's generally called, has seen Chinese financial institutions lending close to $1tn to finance infrastructure projects all over the developing world. With me to discuss all this is Yunnan Chen, a researcher at ODI, a global affairs think-tank. Yunnan, could I start by asking you, in your view, generally speaking, has the BRI been a success? So when the BRI was launched it served multiple purposes. It was seen as China's global public good offer to the world, particularly to the developing world in providing infrastructure, finance, and providing the kind of connectivity infrastructure that could foster greater trade, growth and economic development. But it was also a way for China's own domestic economy to resolve its own problems, and to achieve China's own strategic and economic interests. Why was it helping China domestically? So in this period following the global financial crisis, the Chinese government pumps a huge amount of capital into a domestic economic stimulus. So you see massive infrastructure construction, a huge domestic investment in heavy industries. And around 2011 you're already seeing excess capacity and a bit of an overheated economy. And in this period is when we also see the government trying to push companies and exporters to go out to seek more lucrative better returns in international markets. And they also inject capital into China's policy banks and financial institutions, which enables them to provide the financing to support Chinese companies to win these contracts overseas. Right. It's really extraordinary, though. Over 10 years, nearly $1tn has been lent by these Chinese financial institutions. For some of the recipient developing countries has this made a really big impact? We've seen huge railway projects, some mega projects as they're called, in the form of standard gauge railways in Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya. High-speed railways in south-east Asia, in the case of Jakarta going through Laos. Also, several port investments as well in Kenya, in Pakistan with the China-Pakistan economic corridor. And in a lot of these places this hard infrastructure is also tied into wider investments. A lot of which has also come from Chinese state-owned enterprises and private companies. So you see the establishment of industrial zones, which were trying to bring in greater foreign direct investment. And so really, I mean, that seems like there's been a lot of very positive activity. Have you seen clear impacts on the ground? Chinese investments have brought local employment. They have increased incomes in some areas. And they also have transformed the landscape of cities across Ethiopia, across Africa, for example, in providing this kind of much needed infrastructure. But there has also been quite a lot of controversy around the BRI. Infrastructure, overall, is a very high risk sector. They're very, very long-term investments. They take a very long time to really come to break-even, or to even make money. But what they do serve is a bit more of a public goods function. That said, there have been a certain number of Chinese projects that have really struggled once constructed in making that economic rationale make sense. What we read about now is that the Chinese government is having to bail out quite a few countries that were part of the BRI. One of the consultancies that we quoted in the Financial Times recently said that over the three years from 2019 to 2022, the Chinese government was paying out $104bn to bail out countries that had fallen down on borrowing through the BRI. How does China feel about being, kind of, the lender of last resort to these developing countries? I don't think China is necessarily bailing out the recipient countries, rather than bailing out its own banks. In the end, a lot of this finance, you know, it's lent to the borrowing country. But ultimately it goes back into paying China's policy banks or commercial banks. And in the end it is the Chinese contractors that win the project or that benefit. Well, that's a very interesting point. So in a sense this money is being lent by China to prevent defaults by countries to Chinese financial institutions that have lent to the BRI. Exactly. There's been a, sort of, systematic issue of moral hazard with a lot of these infrastructure projects. You have borrowing countries that have wishlists of infrastructure projects that they want to construct. You have Chinese companies who want to win these contracts. And you have Chinese policy banks and financiers who want to support these companies to go out. And so in all of this we've seen a period of exuberance, particularly in the early part of the 2010s, and then a bit more of a pullback, particularly after 2016. The real critical juncture is when China loses a quarter of its US dollar reserves after the 2015 stock market crisis. And after that you really see a growing conservatism and a bit more of a pullback, and a bit more of a reassessment of the risks that the financial sector is taking overseas - and also domestically. Going forward, do you think that the Chinese government is prepared to continue with these BRI bailouts? Are we going to see tens of billions of US dollars every year being spent by the Chinese government to bail out these BRI projects, or are we going to see something different? Because of the way in which these banks operate, they're also policy-oriented institutions. What that has meant is that there's been a little bit of a kicking the can down the road approach when it comes to dealing with projects that are facing difficulties, or borrowers who are struggling to repay the loans. Banks have, generally, been very unwilling to write down, or make any kind of concession or debt relief that requires them to take a hit on their balance sheets. And in turn, I think what we've seen from the central bank is... as well trying to keep these financial institutions afloat, and keeping them financially healthy. So that they can continue to operate in the way without having to agree to significant cuts or write-downs in their portfolio. Whether that's sustainable, I think, is to be seen. So what do you think comes now, then? I mean, is China falling out of love with the BRI? Is China going to stop the lending to the BRI projects? Or are we already seeing, actually, a decline in the level of lending to BRI? What do you think the future holds for all of this? The impact of Covid, I think, was really already a tail-end of a very dramatic decline in overseas official lending. And there's clearly been a bit more of a pullback and a greater risk aversion from China's policy banks, as well as the ability of China's policy insurer to finance and to underwrite this overseas lending. I don't think this means the end of the BRI as a narrative. And certainly, with the forum this month, there is still a very top-level political commitment to what the BRI represents in terms of China's relations, and as a platform to engage with the Global South and with developing countries. But the rhetoric has shifted already. We're seeing more mentions of small and beautiful projects. A greater emphasis on a green BRI that's more sustainable and prioritises cleaner, greener forms of infrastructure investment. So looking at it from the perspective of the developing world, as we said, China has lent almost $1tn over the last 10 years. This has been a real boon for the ambitions that those developing countries have to build crucial infrastructure. We've now got climate change coming up, presenting huge problems mostly for the developing world. And we've got a population explosion, which is going to see continents like Africa really increase their levels of population over the next 10, 20, 30 years. Doesn't this come at just the wrong time for the developing world? I mean, the fact that China's encountered so many problems in the BRI, and is now retreating a little bit. It does raise a question of where that infrastructure finance is going to come from. And we've seen a response of competitive offer from the G7, and the partnership for growth and infrastructure investment from the EU, in the form of the Global Gateway. And all of these are, again, infrastructure focused, trying to compete with the Belt and Road Initiative in a period where the BRI has already seen a bit of a decline. But China can still play a huge role for climate investment in supporting the energy transitions of developing countries through the provision of renewable technologies, for example. China is the biggest manufacturer and producer at scale of solar panels, of wind turbines, and of renewable and clean energy technologies. And the export of that, and the provision of these at low cost to developing countries will also be crucial in their ambitions for a green energy transition and for a green development pathway.",2022-2025,8,high_conflict
