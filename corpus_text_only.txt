TITLE: Financing Energy infrastructure from abroad: opportunities available in Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Global Gateway Initiative (GGI) – IFA

An apparent mismatch between energy need and the capacity to invest in energy production is requiring Ethiopia to look into alternative finances available from Europe and China. The rapid rise of population accompanied by rapid urbanization and economic growth, Ethiopia needs a rapid growth in energy production proportional to its economy, which by itself hinges on the financial capability of the state. The key hindrances of Ethiopia from producing adequate energy include:
Financial gap: according to UNECA data, Africa needs $170 billion annually to satisfy its infrastructure need, one of which being electric grid installation. Ethiopia also share the same challenge and lacks adequate finance to exploit all its potentials.
Technological gap: generating energy either from water, wind, sunlight, nuclear, or fossil fuel required technological endowment. In the past two decades, in fact, Ethiopia has been tapping into the technology of hydropower dam construction and power generation. But diversifying energy sources and improving the pace of the rate of growth in technological endowment is still a challenge to Ethiopia.
Other challenges: though finance and technology are important ingredients, issues related to policy coordination and dealing with instability and maladministration are also critical factors in limiting the nation from investing in energy production and distribution.
The external financial opportunities made available by China and the European Union are worth mentioning here in order to analyze their role in filling the financial gap Ethiopia is now experiencing.
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
BRI was initiated with the aim to connect Chinese economy with the Eurasia landmass and trans-oceanic maritime space all over the world. Africa also benefitted from BRI though the primary targets of Chinese investment through BRI were Europe and Asia. China financed the construction of the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway line as well as other projects in Kenya and Nigeria. The promise to finance more projects finally halted after the COVID pandemic, which marked the beginning of the decline in the flow of infrastructure finance from China into Africa.
In the post-COVID era, China announced another package of infrastructure finance to Africa. Xi Jinping made it clear on September 5, 2024 at the FOCAC summit that “the Chinese government will provide RMB 360 billion [$50 billion] of financial support through the next three years.”
[1]
From out of the total sum of finance, RMB 210 billion will be distributed under a credit line; RMB 80 billion will be an assistance fund for Africa in different forms and at least RMB 70 billion an investment fund for Chinese companies in Africa.
The key challenge in tapping into the Chinese finance include, first, the beneficiary nation has to adhere to the policy imperatives of China. Embracing ‘one China’ policy is the primary policy expectation if any state aspires to get finance. The second challenge may happen as a result of the source of finance, which is the Chinese state. This implies to the necessity of conducting state-to-state negotiation with little or no space for the private financing enterprises. Third, the issue of debt management is another critical factor in shaping the future of financial interaction between Ethiopia and China. Much of the money gained from China since the beginning of BRI through commercial loan arrangement are either matured or are beyond the capacity of Ethiopia to pay back the accumulated debt. This necessitates the prolonged negotiation for debt restructuring, which tarnish future efforts to request more finance for new projects.
Global Gateway Initiative (GGI)
European Union has a tradition of introducing new budgetary programs, called a Multiannual Indicative Program (MIP), every seven years. For the period 2021 to 2027, EU has allocated €300 billion for a program called Global Gateway Initiative. It is largely an infrastructure development program intended to be invested in countries close to Europe geographically or in terms of interest. Half of the money, which is €150 billion, was promised to disburse to infrastructure developments in Africa. The focus of GGI support and investment include infrastructure projects like high speed road and railway line, energy transition, and digital connectivity. It seems that EU stood behind Africa’s interest to connect African capitals through modern infrastructure. The problem, however, is the value attached to the Initiative, which is beyond the reach of most African nations. EU associated the GGI with democracy, good governance, equal partnership, green and clean energy, and security partnership.  To benefit from GGI, African nations should have to align themselves with the values set out by EU.
The implementation of the GGI is not free from limitations however. Although a lot has been promised at the inception of the Initiative, like to support more than nine trans-boundary road and railway projects to connect East and West Africa and North and South Africa, there is no significant progress in a matter of five years. The other challenge is the lack of transparency from the side of EU either for its priority lists for the beneficiary project or for the project to be financed by GGI. From the limited investments under the umbrella of GGI in Africa, one can see that the interest of EU goes more to energy transition, whereas connecting African capitals is a top priority for Africa, as clearly stipulated in Agenda 2063 vision of AU. Integrating GGI with the values set by EU is also another challenge for Africa since they are largely beyond reach.
Way forward
Strengthening domestic capacity
:  the reliable source of finance for any nation is its own economy. The same is also true for Ethiopia. As it has been observed in the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam by domestic capacity, soliciting fund from within reduces dependency from other nations and reduces the challenges of finance related preconditions. Hence, Ethiopia has to envisage boosting its domestic capability to amass huge finance for energy production.
Neighborly collaboration for energy
: Collaborating with different nations to access finance from foreign sources provides better chance than for a single nation requested for it. The collaboration of Ethiopia and its neighbors for energy production and energy distribution may attract alternative creditors as the beneficiaries are going to be different countries and the risk is also shared among the beneficiaries.
Encouraging the participation of the private sector
: The participation of the private sector in energy production and energy distribution reduces financial stress from the state because the private sector enters into the energy market having its own finance. The private sector may also establish partnership with European and Chinese creditors directly without the involvement of the state. This helps to overpass the debt restructuring challenge that Ethiopia is passing through right now.

TITLE: Ethiopia- China Economic Cooperation

Ethiopia- China Economic Cooperation
Published:
Dec. 26, 2023
Introduction
Ethiopia and China established the first official diplomatic relations in 1970 and opened embassies in Beijing and in Addis Ababa. After a year, in 1971, the two nations signed the first economic and technical cooperation framework agreements.
At the beginning, the cooperation of the two nations was focused on livelihood support and   capacity buildings. However, later it improved into a holistic approach such as financing development projects and programs, foreign direct investment (FDI), trade and construction.
Since October 2023, the cooperation of the two countries further developed from
Comprehensive Strategic Cooperation Partnership
to
all weather Development Cooperation
which People Republic of China (PRC) has such partnership only with few countries.
The cooperation is getting stronger.
The Ethiopian and Chines economic cooperation strategically focused on the development of infrastructures such as railways, highways, telecommunication, airport terminal, industrial development, construction of electric power generating, distributing and substations. In this respect our development priorities have been directly coherence with Chines government development initiatives,
Forum on China Africa Cooperation (FOCAC)
and
Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI).
Since 2006, Ethiopian has undertaken over 70 mega projects with these China initiatives. In order to implement those projects, the Chines government and financial instituted allocated about 14.83 billion USD loans, from 2006 to 2018.
The other focus areas of cooperation are investment in industries and trade. In this respect several Chines companies invested in the industrial sector and other businesses. Among these investments,  ESTERN industrial zone, Huajian industrial park, Dire Dawa industrial park and others investments generated huge amount of foreign currency and revenues in terms of tax for Ethiopia.  Currently Chinas foreign direct investment reached about USD 4 billion, and 1844 Chines projects are operating in Ethiopia.
The construction sector is the other area of involvement that cooperation is strengthened.  The chines companies played pivotal roles in the construction and built several mega projects of the country. Many railway lines, express roads and highways, suspension bridges, skyline buildings, industrial parks, sugar factories, hydro power dam, wind power plants, substation and transmission line, the Addis Ababa riverside park and many other projects in Ethiopia have been constructed by chines companies.
Conclusion
Ethiopia used all financial resources from china to develop those mega projects. For instance, among the 70 projects 57 of them are infrastructural projects which costed about USD 12.2 billion (82.2 Percent of all loans from China).  More specifically, 22 projects are transport and communication sector projects, 35 projects are power sector projects, and the remaining 13 projects are sugar factories and urban water supply projects.
Thus, Ethio- China economic cooperation is comprehensive and strategic highly contributed to Ethiopian growth and development.  In today’s Ethiopia, the contributions of People Republic China government and people have a paramount value.

TITLE: Ethiopia’s Sea Access Strategy: From Geopolitical Challenge to Economic Necessity – IFA

Introduction:
From Silence to Strategy
More than thirty years after becoming landlocked following Eritrea’s independence in 1993, Ethiopia, Africa’s second most populous country, remains without direct access to the sea.  While landmark projects like the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) have brought energy security, the absence of a coastline continues to constrain Ethiopia’s economic potential and strategic autonomy.
For years, the topic of sea access was politically sensitive and largely avoided in public discourse. However, that has changed. The Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Abiy Ahmed, has placed the issue back at the forefront, reframing Ethiopia’s lack of maritime access not simply as a historical consequence, but as a pressing developmental and geopolitical challenge.
With a population exceeding 126 million and projected to surpass 150 million by 2030 (World Bank, 2024), Ethiopia argues that remaining in what officials describe as a “geographic prison” is no longer sustainable. This claim is rooted not only in demographic pressures, but also in Ethiopia’s long maritime history and increasing vulnerability due to dependence on a single foreign port.
This article provides an overview of Ethiopia’s historical maritime ties, current constraints, and emerging strategies for securing access to the sea. Drawing lessons from other landlocked nations, it outlines diplomatic options grounded in cooperation, regional integration, and international law.
2. A Historical Turning Point
Ethiopia’s maritime legacy stretches back to ancient times and it is well documented.  During the Axumite Empire, ports like Adulis and Massawa provided access to Red Sea trade routes. More recently, until the late 1990s, Ethiopia relied primarily on the port of Assab for its maritime commerce.
The situation changed dramatically in 1993 when Eritrea became independent. Although Ethiopia temporarily maintained access to Eritrean ports through transitional arrangements, the 1998–2000 border war between Ethiopia and Eritrea severed these ties completely. Since then, Ethiopia has depended almost entirely on the Port of Djibouti, which now handles over 90% of its maritime trade (World Bank, 2023).
This dependence has renewed interest in Ethiopia’s historical maritime claims and the 19th century colonial injustice.  During the colonial period, the 1884 Hewett Treaty granted Ethiopia access to the sea through a British-Egyptian agreement. Later, in 1952, the UN recognized Ethiopia’s need for port access when it federated Eritrea under Resolution 390.
Today, these legal and diplomatic precedents are being revisited not to reclaim the past, but to secure a more stable and prosperous future.
3. Why Sea Access Matters for Ethiopia Today?
For Ethiopia, sea access is not merely a symbolic issue, it is vital for sustainable development. As the country expands its industrial base, with export-oriented sectors like textiles, leather goods, and agribusiness growing rapidly, efficient and affordable logistics have become essential.
Ethiopia is also emerging as a regional energy hub, supplying electricity to neighboring countries.  This role depends on the steady import of equipment, materials, and technology, almost all of which must pass through Djibouti.
However, this reliance on a single port comes at a steep cost with an estimated $1.5 to $2 billion annual spending on port fees and related services (UNCTAD, 2021). It also presents strategic vulnerabilities from political shifts and economic pressures to supply chain disruptions.
Increasingly, Ethiopia’s maritime strategy is shifting from aspiration to necessity.  Diversifying access to the sea is now central to the country’s broader goals; such as joining the World Trade Organization (WTO), integrating into the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), and positioning itself as  logistics and trade hub in the Horn of Africa.
4. What Does International Law Say About Landlocked Countries
International law strongly supports the rights of landlocked countries to access the sea. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) guarantees the right of transit through neighboring coastal states though the implementation of these rights depends on bilateral or regional agreements.
In Africa, the 2050 Africa’s Integrated Maritime Strategy (AIMS) reframes the conversation by replacing the term “landlocked” with “land-linked” or “landly-connected.”  This shift in language reflects a more optimistic and cooperative vision one in which countries without coastlines are still actively engaged in maritime affairs through regional partnerships.
Ethiopia’s current sea access debate has sparked different views.  Some critics frame it as a demand for ownership of a port, while others point to the controversial way Assab was transferred to Eritrea during Ethiopia’s transitional period after the fall of the military regime.  They argue that the government at the time lacked the legal authority to make such a concession, suggesting that Ethiopia’s rights to Assab may never have been formally surrendered.
Regardless of historical claims, international legal frameworks like UNCLOS, grants landlocked states the right of access to and from the sea through transit states. However, the practical application of this right depends on bilateral or regional agreements, allowing the countries involved to determine the “how” of these rights, meaning how they are exercised. This highlights the importance of diplomacy, mutual benefit, and regional cooperation, as legal rights alone are rarely sufficient.
Furthermore, the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries (2014–2024), and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development all emphasize the importance of cooperation, infrastructure development, and inclusive trade. The UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/63/17 also supports the creation of transit agreements and infrastructure tailored to landlocked states.  Institutions such as UN-OHRLLS, UNECA, and AfCFTA continue to promote cross-border trade, regional integration and harmonized regional infrastructure.
The foregoing underscore while legal rights matter, their effectiveness depends on diplomatic engagement and sustained cooperation.
5. Regional Momentum: A Window of Opportunity
Ethiopia’s maritime ambitions align well with wider regional trends. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) aims to lower trade barriers, improve infrastructure, and foster intra-African commerce. UNCTAD estimates that AfCFTA could reduce trade costs for landlocked countries by up to 11% and increase freight volumes by nearly 30%.
Ethiopia is also nearing full WTO membership and expanding its presence in global trade.  For this, dependable maritime access is essential to attract investment and facilitate exports. Its membership to BRICS further elevates the country’s strategic profile, offering new allies and platforms for maritime negotiations, infrastructure investment, and trade corridor development.
By framing port diversification as part of a broader African integration agenda, Ethiopia can move the conversation beyond bilateral disputes.  Pan-African platforms like AIMS 2050 (Africa’s Integrated Maritime Strategy) provide a shared roadmap for maritime cooperation, legal harmonization, and regional security.
6. What Other Countries Can Teach Ethiopia
Moldova: Diplomacy Over Territory
Moldova, after losing its coastline due to border shifts, negotiated and struck a creative deal with Ukraine in 1999.  Moldova gave up a small section of land for a road and in return, Ukraine granted Moldova a 430-meter stretch along the Danube River enabling the creation of its new international free port. This model shows that maritime access can be achieved through diplomacy and this offers a precedent Ethiopia could consider.
Morocco and the Sahel: A Shared Corridor Vision
In 2023, Morocco launched an initiative to provide landlocked Sahel countries like Mali, Niger, and Chad with access to Atlantic ports via Moroccan infrastructure. Through the development of corridors and shared logistics platforms, Morocco has enhanced both economic ties and regional influence.
This cooperative approach offers valuable lessons for the Horn of Africa, where a similar model could ease tensions and promote shared development.  In contrast, countries like Ethiopia and Eritrea have yet to build a coordinated port access strategy despite facing similar challenges in a volatile Red Sea region. This also informs that landlocked nations can regain maritime access through infrastructure development. It is a model Ethiopia could study closely.
Somaliland: A Strategic but Controversial Deal
In early 2024, Ethiopia signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Somaliland, leasing a 20-kilometer stretch of coastline for 50 years in exchange for infrastructure investments. This signaled possible recognition of Somaliland’s autonomy. While this sparked outrage in Somalia, Ethiopia views the deal as a pragmatic move to address its maritime needs.  Though controversial, the MoU reflects a shift from symbolic politics to strategic pragmatism.
The Belt and Road Initiative
Another opportunity lies in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which can provide landlocked countries with greater leverage in international negotiations. By creating alternative transit routes and connecting these countries to multiple coastal or regional gateways, the BRI helps reduce dependence on any single transit country. For instance, Ethiopia now relies on the Ethiopia-Djibouti standard gauge railway built under the BRI to access the Port of Djibouti.  This will significantly reduce transit time and cost as compared to road transport and thus lessening the risk of overreliance on a single corridor (Xinhua, 2025).
Similarly, in Central Asia, Kazakhstan has enhanced its rail access to China and Europe via projects like the doubling of the DostykMoyynty crossing and its participation in the TransCaspian or “Middle Corridor,” which offers a strategic alternative to Russian routes (RailFreight, 2023).
7. What Should Ethiopia Do Next?
From Isolation to Integration
To secure sustainable sea access, Ethiopia must adopt a multi-pronged strategy rooted in diplomacy, investment, and regional cooperation. Key actions include:
Re-engage with Eritrea- open dialogue to negotiate mutually beneficial access to the port of Assab.
Deepen Ties with Djibouti and improve logistics and seek more favorable trade terms.
Operationalize the Somaliland MoU: Work with regional bodies like the African Union and IGAD to ensure legal and diplomatic backing.
Invest in LAPSSET (Kenya): Increase participation in this strategic corridor linking Ethiopia to the Indian Ocean.
Integrate Ethiopia’s quest for sea into Pan-African Frameworks: Align maritime strategies with AfCFTA and AIMS 2050 to attract funding and regional support.
In summary, Ethiopia’s landlocked status is not just a geographical inconvenience; it is a developmental bottleneck. No matter how ambitious its industrial, energy, or economic reforms, the absence of reliable sea access will continue to limit progress.
It is time to treat maritime access not as a nationalist issue, but as a regional development challenge. The path forward lies in cooperation, not confrontation. With a clear, lawful, and diplomatically coordinated maritime strategy, Ethiopia can protect its national interests while contributing to peace and integration across the Horn of Africa.

TITLE: The Battle for Africa’s Strategic Wealth: Leveraging Resource Power in the Era of Critical Mineral Geopolitics – IFA

Introduction
The world is rapidly moving to a new wave of technological evolution where Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we work, learn things and support innovation efforts; Green technologies reshape production systems and accelerate the transition to sustainable development. These shifts are redefining global competitiveness, reframe labor market modalities and support data driven decision making, bringing new opportunities for individuals, businesses entities and countries. Additionally, this transformation redirects the energy demand as the adoption of environmental friendly technologies such as electric vehicles has become part of our lives and prior preferences.
Modern societies and economies has increasingly rely on critical minerals. Contemporary technological inventions highly demand critical minerals as crucial element, as more industries and economies are transitioning to clean energy sources.
[i]
Apart from critical minerals as inputs of energy production and supporting transition efforts, they play a prominent role in defense technologies and weapons systems, Aerospace components and satellite systems, digital infrastructure and semiconductor manufacturing and Medical equipment and pharmaceutical production sectors
[ii]
.
This technological shift forms critical minerals equally important components in the era of Artificial intelligence and green technology revolution. The demand and extraction of minerals such as lithium, graphite and cobalt
will need to increase by
at least
500
per cent by 2050.
[iii]
According to the 2023 Critical Minerals Market Review by the International Energy Agency, demand for lithium tripled, and that of cobalt and nickel rose by 70% and 40%, respectively, from 2017 to 2022.
[iv]
Similarly, the market size of critical minerals doubled over the past five years, reaching $320 billion in 2022.
[v]
Africa stands at the forefront of this transformative global shift towards sustainable energy sources, as the world increasingly pivots to green technologies. The continent’s mineral reserve is estimated to constitute 30 percent of the world’s known mineral deposit,
[vi]
including 85% of the world’s manganese, 80% of platinum and chromium, 47% of cobalt, and significant shares of graphite and copper
[vii]
, positioning the continent as the key player in the emerging global green technology revolution.  As countries race to secure the critical minerals needed for clean energy technologies such as electric vehicles, battery storage systems and renewable energy Infrastructure, Africa is drawing into the spotlight in global geopolitics. This intersection of global energy demand and continental endowment of resources underscores Africa’s strategic importance in the 21
st
century new technological era and energy transition.
2.
Critical Mineral Geopolitics
The importance of Africa in mineral geopolitics has increased significantly as the continent is a cheap and abundant source of the industrial supply chain in critical mineral markets. It is within this context that major global powers such as China, United States, United Kingdom, and European Union, Japan as well as several middle powers have become increasingly interested to enhance and renew their diplomatic relationship with African countries. They are also investing in infrastructure project and introducing various development initiatives aimed implicitly or explicitly to facilitate the mineral supplies needed by their industries and high tech companies.
As part of a larger strategy to lessen reliance on Chinese-dominated supply chains, the United States has increased its focus on African critical minerals, particularly after China banned the export of Germanium and Gallium to the United States in December 2024
[viii]
, two metals critical to semiconductors and military uses. In particular, the US has established a number of mineral agreements, such as the most recent one with Ukraine, to boost strategic and domestic resource availability right away. The country is also aggressively engaging in Africa’s mineral market. It has committed $553 million investment on the Lobito Atlantic Railway upgrade in Angola; implement the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) with allies to coordinate investments and establish bilateral critical mineral partnerships with several African nations including Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia.
[ix]
All these efforts are manifestations that US severely is in need of competing to possess critical minerals in Africa.
Over the past 20 years, China has maintained a dominant position in African essential minerals by controlling almost 70% of the world’s processing capacity for 19 out of 20 vital minerals. Furthermore, China has extracted and imported 28% of Africa’s graphite, 58% of its manganese, and 72% of its cobalt.
[x]
China is also a key country investing in infrastructures such as Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA) revitalization which will cost over $1.4 billion and leveraging decades of infrastructure development including Belt and road initiative and mining investments to maintain its critical mineral dominance. Japan has become a key player and significant competitor by supporting the Nacala Corridor connecting Zambia and Malawi to the Indian Ocean via Mozambique. The European Union has also developed its Critical Raw Materials Act with specific provisions targeting African partnerships
[xi]
and signing memorandum of understanding with South Africa (2025), Rwanda (2024), DRC and Zambia (2023)
[xii]
to increase its supply of raw materials  through what they call it ‘Raw material diplomacy’.
[xiii]
All these infrastructural investment’s particularly those linking mineral extraction sites to ports along with the rise in bilateral agreements by international powers; reflect their primary goal of securing mineral resources to fuel their competition in global technological race. As a result, Africa is increasingly becoming a battle ground shaped by the pressures of this new technological era. Amid, the growing technological competition, particularly between China and the United States, Africa has emerged as a key battleground for strategic minerals. States such as DRC. Zambia, Burundi, Tanzania in particular has become centers of competition among international actors and directly or indirectly their peace and stability is also linked with these contestation.
3.
Leveraging  Resource power and Projecting strategic influence
As global powers increasingly view Africa as an important player to their economic future and a vital source of supply chain in the race for technological competition, African countries should grab this opportunities for their diplomatic influence, economic development and projecting the continents role in global economy. Africa can leverage its mineral wealth as a strategic tool in diplomacy by negotiating access to critical minerals in exchange for security cooperation and strengthening capacity for strong resource governance. Mineral diplomacy could enable African states to utilize natural resource demand for broader political and security gains. For example as DRC face the advance of M23 rebels in its eastern provinces, the government has made a deal to leverage its minerals in exchange for security assistance from the U.S. government.
Additionally, International actors are also highly interested to invest in infrastructures such as railways and ports to ease business operations in mineral sector. The U.S.-backed Lobito Corridor, which links Angola’s Atlantic coast to copper and cobalt mines in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo; the China-backed TAZARA Railway, which links Tanzania’s Dar es Salaam port to Zambia’s copper belt; and the Japan-backed Nacala Corridor, which links Zambia and Malawi to Mozambique’s Nacala port on the Indian Ocean, are few examples. African nations should aggressively take advantage of these opportunities by negotiating their critical minerals for long-term development results, as more international players will be interested in investing as the role of key minerals in technology grows in the upcoming decades.
Furthermore, African nations could use foreign partners to invest in local manufacturing and refining with the goal of exporting value-added critical mineral goods, as more global and middle-power nations are investing in critical mineral extraction. For example, Zimbabwe banned the export of raw lithium to compel investors to process it domestically; Namibia is positioning itself as a major green hydrogen producer looking to build integrated hydrogen and ammonia production facilities to supply global markets; and the DRC and Zambia have moved to restrict raw cobalt and copper exports, demanding that processing be done locally.

Other nations should follow the same footsteps by balancing national interest and foreign direct investment to boost local economies.
In general, African nations can maximize benefits by negotiating more favorable terms with investors and as the world needs the continents critical minerals, it’s time for Africa to leverage its resource power to be an important player in global political economy. However, African countries should introduce strong resource governance frameworks and monitoring mechanisms since critical minerals could produce negative outcome in peace and stability of those nations

Conclusion
Africa hosts significant deposits of copper, cobalt, lithium, manganese, platinum group metals, rare earth elements, graphite, and bauxite, among others. This puts the continent at the new front in critical minerals power play as the technological shift the world is witnessing needs Africa’s strategic wealth. International actors such as USA, China, Europe, Japan and others are deeply involving in critical geopolitical competition and Africa is becoming a battleground for them to secure sufficient enough resources for their green energy transitions, defense technologies,  semiconductor manufacturing etc. Realizing the role their strategic wealth plays, Africa should use these opportunities to strength their diplomatic bargaining power, negotiating their critical minerals for long term development outcomes and leverage international partners to invest in local refining and manufacturing aiming to export value added critical mineral products.

Ethiopia—once a Red Sea power and now the world’s largest landlocked nation—bears crushing transit costs and security risks as over 85% of its trade funnels through Djibouti. This historic setback and economic strain have reignited a fierce national drive for sea access, intensified by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s recent declaration, which stirred deep national pride while provoking swift regional pushback.

TITLE: Ethiopia’s Strategic Positioning Amidst Possible Rise in US-China Rivalry Following Trump’s Second Term. – IFA

By: Anteneh Getachew(PhD)
The world watches with bated breath as the newly elected American president’s policy directions—spanning economic, social, political, and diplomatic realms—begin to take shape. Regardless of the specific strategies, a profound shift in global and regional geopolitical dynamics across Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Africa is widely anticipated.
The tenure of outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden has been marked by significant global developments. Key events include the deteriorating relationship with numerous East African States, the cancellation of the AGOA preference for five African States, escalating Ukraine war, the Israel-Palestine war, the expansion of BRICS+, and the civil war as well as worsening humanitarian situation in Sudan. The Horn of Africa, a critical geopolitical hotspot and a focal point of intense competition among global powers, including China, is no exception.
President-elect Donald Trump has signaled plans for a more aggressive stance toward China, building on his hardline approach during his previous term. In pre-election speeches and the “Project 2025” blueprint, Trump hinted at intensifying economic warfare with China, potentially adopting more confrontational trade policies than those of the Biden administration. These strategies aim to curtail China’s global economic influence through heightened protectionism, significant tariff adjustments, and stringent regulations. Such measures are likely to reshape U.S.-China relations dramatically. For countries in the Horn of Africa-particularly Ethiopia, which has been a major recipient of Chinese financial assistance and investment; this shift could bring complex and far-reaching consequences, compelling recalibration of strategies amidst the evolving geopolitical and economic landscape.
If carefully managed, the shifting dynamics of U.S.-China rivalry in the Horn of Africa could present more opportunities than challenges, particularly for Ethiopia. Analysts highlight that a key shortcoming of Donald Trump’s previous presidency was its relegation of Africa, and the Horn of Africa in particular, to a secondary priority, with limited focus and engagement. In addition to creating an opening for other global players, notably China, to deepen their influence in the region, his approach was sometimes swayed by actors like Egypt, leading to controversial moments like his widely criticized remarks on the GERD. However, his administration’s effort to bring Ethiopia and Egypt to the negotiating table on the dam issue remains a notable achievement.
As Donald Trump returns to the presidency, there is hope that his administration will address past policy missteps and recognize the strategic significance of the Horn of Africa for global trade and security. This could pave the way for stronger, more beneficial partnerships with Africa, and particularly the Horn region. For Ethiopia, the challenge lies in its capability in seizing whatever opportunities that arise from the rivalry between the US and China while carefully balancing its relationships with both. How Ethiopia navigates these shifting geopolitical and economic dynamics will also play a crucial role in shaping its future position on the global stage. This article examines the impacts Trump’s second presidency might have on the geopolitical and economic landscapes of the Horn of Africa specifically addressing how Ethiopia can navigate through the complex web of opportunities and challenges that can arise from heightened U.S.-China rivalry in the region.
A defining aspect of outgoing President Joe Biden’s administration was its renewed geostrategic and economic engagement with Africa, aiming to counter China’s growing influence, particularly in key strategic areas, while adopting a more measured tone and reduced reliance on military approaches. In contrast, President-elect Donald Trump appears poised to adopt a more aggressive stance toward China. Unlike Biden, Trump favors transactional, bilateral relationships over institutional frameworks that promote multilateral cooperation, signaling a different approach to U.S.-Africa relations.
Donald Trump has consistently framed China as a strategic adversary, yet his “America First” approach and reduced focus on multilateral engagement signals a shift in the geopolitical landscape that could diminish the U.S.’s role in global affairs. America’s withdrawal from key global institutions, including the cancellation of agreements like the Paris Climate Accord and the Iran Nuclear Deal, has created space for China to expand its influence over global issues and governance structures. Additionally, the recent growth of opposing blocs like BRICS further weakens U.S. involvement in international forums, potentially giving China an advantage in reshaping the global order and accelerating its pursuit of global leadership.
Trump’s nationalist, protectionist trade policies threaten to heighten tensions with China, while also calling for substantial tariffs on goods from all trade partners, with especially harsh measures targeting Chinese imports. It appears that Trump is prepared to take strong action to challenge China’s dominance in critical sectors such as green technology, energy production, and electric vehicle manufacturing, potentially reshaping global supply chains and prompting shifts in international alliances.
In such an evolving scenario, Ethiopia, a key regional player and renewable energy hub, will likely find itself caught in the complexities of this rivalry, especially in its pursuit of a transition to green energy and environment-friendly economic development.
China is increasingly influential in the Horn of Africa, significantly shaping the geopolitical and economic landscape following the Trump administration. The Belt and Road Initiative has dramatically transformed the region through substantial investments in vital sectors like infrastructure, energy, and telecommunications. Ethiopia, as one of the BRI’s focal points, has seen massive Chinese investments. Although China’s investments in Ethiopia are fostering economic growth, concerns about debt trap and erosion of sovereignty are not difficult to come by. Such fault lines in Africa–China relations would serve Trump’s US to recalibrate its geo-economic engagement with Africa, in general, and countries of the Horn region, in particular.
Historically, the U.S. has been a key source of development aid to Ethiopia, but its emphasis on governance and human rights has created a complex diplomatic environment for Ethiopia as it strives to become a regional power amid the U.S.-China rivalry. With China playing a major role in Ethiopia’s infrastructure development and the U.S. prioritizing democratic reforms and security cooperation, the stakes are high. As Trump’s incoming administration is expected to focus more on geo-economic engagements, the pressing question remains: how can Ethiopia effectively navigate this complex landscape?
Opportunities and Challenges
Following the recent implementation of macroeconomic policy reforms, Ethiopia is now strategically positioned to diversify its economy and attract foreign direct investment. With a goal of building a more resilient economy, Ethiopia has pledged to expand its international partnerships, moving away from the limited funding sources it previously relied on. Balancing its relationships with both China and the U.S. presents Ethiopia with both opportunities and challenges. In addition to raising concerns about global economic stability, the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s proposed economic and trade policies poses significant challenges for emerging economies like Ethiopia.
The ongoing tensions over the GERD—a contentious issue with Egypt and Sudan—present another significant concern for Ethiopia as Trump returns to office. Egypt’s involvement in the Middle East “mediation” efforts, its role in the Abraham Accord, and its comparative advantage in lobbying U.S. Congress members to influence opinions on the GERD highlight the potential for the new administration’s stance to be swayed against Ethiopia’s interests and could intensify pressure on Ethiopia and its developmental needs. As a response, Ethiopia must pursue a more robust diplomatic engagement with the new administration while also strengthening cooperation with riparian countries that have ratified the CFA as a strategic alternative.
As the Horn of Africa region continues to grapple with persistent conflict and instability, the issue is further complicated by the involvement of major powers like the U.S. and China, among other state actors. For Ethiopia, navigating these competing interests is essential to strengthening its security strategy, and calls for enhancing military ties with the U.S. for defense assistance and leveraging China’s investments in security infrastructure are critical steps in addressing terrorist threats and regional instability. By engaging with both powers, Ethiopia can strategically balance its alliances while effectively addressing the pressing security challenges.
Conclusion
With the new phase of U.S.-China relations in the wake of Trump’s reelection, Ethiopia is at a critical turning point, facing both opportunities and challenges that can be leveraged to enhance its influence in the Horn of Africa. Ethiopia has the potential to strengthen its geopolitical and geo-economic position by diversifying its international partnerships and employing a proactive diplomatic strategy. The choices made by Ethiopia today will significantly impact its internal stability and its future regional diplomatic posture, ultimately affecting the broader dynamics of the Horn of Africa for years to come.

Introduction
The BRICS grouping—comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—was founded on three major tenets: political and security, economic and financial, and cultural and people-to-people cooperation. Despite its vast scope of interests and goals, BRICS is still seen as a forum for economic and developmental partnership, rather than a comprehensive political or security alliance (Mdlokovana, 2025).
In BRICS, the level of cooperation on security is rather
low and tends to be bilateral.
There is no collective mechanism established among the member countries on a formal level and as well the platform lacks shared vision on security threats (Cutrera, 2020). In fact, BRICS countries have different views on security. Whereas some member countries tend to perceive it as a military risk; others as sovereignty, or non-intervention, economic security, or some other threats related to cyberspace. These differences make a unified strategy unlikely.
This means that the BRICS platform lacks the ability to address to common security issues, resolve conflicts, and assure solidarity to its member states in case of external threats. This is even more reinforced by the varied and, at some instances, divergent geopolitical agendas of its member states. This is going to be even more complex considering that there are new BRICS member states including Egypt
,
Ethiopia, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, and other nine partner Countries included in the platform (
Makhija
, 2025).
There are many instances wherein
the
BRICS members have taken
contradicting stances within regional conflicts.
A case in point includes China’s strategic partnership with Pakistan which conflicts with India’s national security imperatives (Noor, 2014). This exemplifies that a structural problem may be created within BRICS if a security mechanism is not in place, and hence this may widen gaps in cooperation and hinder deeper integration.
The Need for Security
Mechanisms
Even if the BRICS members share a common vision of transforming global governance and achieving a more multipolar international system, they diverge on their security strategy priorities, threat perceptions, and regional roles which make it challenging to consolidate the bloc (
De Carvalho
, 2025). Every member operates in a different geological setting, thereby entertaining separate security threats, such as regional conflicts, border disputes, terrorism, cyber, and economic coercion, among others, which might hamper coordination of security policies and as a result weaken collective threats actions.
Under such a situation, it is imperative for BRICS to develop appropriate security mechanisms to handle the divergence within the bloc and foster more security among each other, build mutual trust and avoid security deviations that might hamper cooperation in this regard. The key justifications for such mechanisms within BRICS include:
Towards a Strong Security Framework
Of more than 180 BRICS cooperation mechanisms, very few actually operate within the security arena. These include: the BRICS National Security Advisors Meeting (endorsed at the II BRICS Summit—Brasilia Joint Statement, 2010); the BRICS Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Council (endorsed at the VII BRICS Summit—Ufa Declaration, 2015); the BRICS Working Group on Security in the Use of ICTs (endorsed at the VII BRICS Summit—Ufa Declaration, 2015); and the BRICS Working Group on Counter-Terrorism (endorsed at the VIII BRICS Summit—Goa Declaration, 2016).
Even with the mechanisms above, it can be noted that their scope is dominantly placed within the counter-terrorism and
cyber security, rather than encompassing broader or collective security concerns in real terms.
If BRICS is to emerge as a strategic coalition in its true form, it has to move beyond economic coordination and adopt
a
more comprehensive strategic approach to security. The comprehensive security framework would give rise to an opportunity where conflicts can be dealt with on a collaborative basis and would also facilitate increased transparency among its members. Adopting a collective approach would also increase its stature on the international scene and would give BRICS a much more significant opportunity to play its part in international security.
Preventing Negative
Repercussions
Without binding security cooperation measures in place, member states remain free to support external actors outside the bloc that may be at odds with fellow BRICS members. Such actions set troubling precedents that can be repeated and amplified. In cases where one BRICS member finds itself supporting an ally of an adversary of another, such incidents create
conflicts
of interest between member states, eroding trust and undermining strategic cohesion within the bloc. Ideally, a structured security strategy would help limit these contradictions by establishing
clear
and expectations
reducing the likelihood of members taking actions that harm each other’s interests.
Avoiding Support for Opponents of Member States
Being such a long-term cooperative framework, BRICS faces threats if its member states support organizations or countries that can potentially threaten other member states. If such patterns continue, there is every possibility that its relevance and credibility can diminish. For development of its security strategies, there should provisions that can deter member states from providing political, financial, or military support to any actor that can threaten other BRICS member countries. In such a way the bloc can better maintain unity and strengthen its collective voice in global affairs by promoting internal solidarity.
Conclusion
Indeed, it can be argued that to date, the BRICS grouping has not yet materialized or can be said “failed to” carve out a comprehensive security strategy, which is partly owing to the divers , sometimes conflicting, geopolitical interests of its member states. that belong to the same alliance umbrella . Thus, it is recommended that in order to overcome these challenges, and strengthen the bloc’s strategic relevance, BRICS ought to make efforts to collectively carve out a shared security framework that includes common principles, conflict-prevention, improved intelligence sharing, and informal norms to
desist from taking the side of those who might be considered hostile to any member state could be incorporated. Additionally, it would also be of paramount
importance to include initiatives such as structured security dialogues and
peacekeeping cooperation to deepen trust and help transform trust and help BRICS from a primarily economic partnership to a more coherent and influential global coalition.

TITLE: Ethiopia’s BRICS Membership: Potential to Strengthen Ties with the Middle East and North Africa Region – IFA

Introduction
The founding members of BRICS assert that the group represents the interests of “the global majority.” In this light, undoubtedly, Ethiopia’s membership in such a group would enhance its posture on the global stage. Among others, its accession helps the country to raise its critical concerns in a multilateral forum, advocate for Africa’s interests, and accelerate the realization of its Sustainable Development Goals (Horn Review, 2023). Prior to the Johannesburg Summit, over 40 countries including Ethiopia expressed their interest in joining the bloc (Reuters, 2023). Yet, the summit adopted the request of only six countries where Ethiopia was one of them. Succeeding membership in such an intense competition, therefore, means a lot for Ethiopia’s global visibility, particularly after the outbreak of the Northern conflict, which had previously cast a shadow over the country’s international image.
Traditionally, Ethiopia has been known for its non-aligned movement and supporter of independence struggles in Africa. It has also considered itself as the champion of Pan-Africanism, promoter of African Solutions for African Problems, and to some extent, pioneer of
Afrabia
frameworks. On the top of these achievements, Ethiopia’s admission to the BRICS bloc provided a platform to show its remarkable potential and engage with major superpowers, including China and Russia. Apart from that, its accession opens a new window of opportunity for the country to approach the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region through the BRICS framework.
While approving the request of several MENA countries, in relative terms, the Johannesburg summit enabled more homogenous countries to join the group. From a geo-economic perspective, the newly joining BRICS members are predominantly Oil Producing Countries with the exception of Ethiopia. Consequently, in statistical terms, following the Johannesburg Summit, the representation of the MENA region in the BRICS BLOC rose from Zero to nearly one-third. In fact, some analysts criticized such BRICS expansion as “very middle East Centric” and “OPEC dominated” while others preferred to call it “BRICS plus OPEC” (Ismael, 2023). Notwithstanding, Ethiopia’s entry into the BRICS bloc, together with several MENA countries, is believed to create a strategic opening to engage the MENA region more closely, thereby emboldening its diplomatic relationship with member states.
Ethiopia and the MENA Region
Ethiopia occupies a geopolitically strategic location in the Horn of Africa, located near to the Red Sea Region. According to Professor Brook Hailu, such a geographical position gives BRICS a gateway to project influence in Africa and the Middle East (Ethiopian News Agency, 2024). In particular, the inclusion of Ethiopia in the BRICS club paves the way to cooperate on important matters with MENA countries. It is unfortunate, hitherto institutional-based cooperation between Ethiopia and the MENA region seemed to have been less promising, hindering the country from effectively utilizing those existing geopolitical and geostrategic advantages in the region. Meanwhile, sadly, Ethiopia’s arch-foe rival in the region, Egypt, has recklessly exploited most of those MENA related organizations to downgrade Ethiopia’s national interest.
One of the most troubling aspects of Ethiopia’s exclusion from MENA regional platforms is its denial of opportunity for sharing its views in the MENA regional stage. This marginalization has been demonstrated during the GERD dispute, for instance, when the Arab League expressed its concern over the water security of Egypt. The League passed a resolution against Ethiopia several times. In one of the resolutions, it informed the UN Security Council to take “necessary measures”, claiming the presence of “a United Arab Position” (Aljazeera, 2021). In response, Ethiopia slammed the resolution, blaming the downstream countries for unreasonable politicization of the GERD’s negotiations. In a similar vein, most of the MENA regional organizations expressed their partisan concern. Principally, upon Somalia’s call, the Arab League and the Organizations of Islamic Cooperation rejected the Memorandum of Understanding, arguing it violates Somalia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity though the intention of Ethiopia is totally contradict to such accusations. Importantly, had Ethiopia been a member of MANA based regional organizations, the afore–stated baseless accusations, and many others, would likely not have been directed at Ethiopia, at least with the tone they have been communicated. Hence, Ethiopia’s inclusion in the BRICS bloc, which comprises several MENA countries, can provide a valuable platform for articulating its interests and fostering strategic engagement through constructive dialogue.
Conclusion and Policy Recommendations
Ethiopia’s accession to BRICS together with MENA countries could enhance its connectivity with the MENA region, positioning it as a bridge between Sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab world. Hence, its BRICS membership could create a new diplomatic space, enabling the voice of Ethiopia to be heard equally with others, such as Egypt. It should be noted that Ethiopia’s exclusion from the MENA dominated regional organizations would hinder any potential cooperation, affecting both parties. Being the only non-MENA country joined BRICS at the Johannesburg Summit, Ethiopia needs to step on the following strategic action. First, it should navigate the Golden-Mean when engaging potentially rival new BRICS members, if any, while remaining mindful of the relative homogeneity among MENA countries. Secondly, Ethiopia should also proactively engage existing MENA affiliated regional organizations, seeking their neutrality or potential mediation role, whenever appropriate.

The transformation of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia from an agrarian-centered economy into a digitally empowered “African Beacon of Prosperity” represents one of the most ambitious socio-economic transitions in the Horn of Africa. This strategic evolution, catalyzed by the completion of the Digital Ethiopia 2025 roadmap and the rollout of the Digital Ethiopia 2030 (DE2030) framework, marks a shift from diagnostic policy planning to institutionalize digital execution. These twin frameworks emphasize scalable Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), telecommunications liberalization, and innovation-oriented legislation. The approach aims to harness the opportunities of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) while mitigating vulnerabilities associated with data dependency and technological inequities (World Bank, 2024).
The Digital Transformation Policy Architecture
Ethiopia’s digital transformation is grounded in an integrated policy ecosystem that links national planning to regional and global agendas. The Digital Ethiopia 2025 strategy identified four pillars: enabling infrastructure, digital governance, entrepreneurship, and human capital development. Its 2030 successor, DE2030, expands this agenda by embedding digital transformation within Ethiopia’s Ten-Year Development Plan (2021–2030) and the African Union’s Digital Transformation Strategy for Africa (2020–2030) (AUC, 2025).
A central feature of DE2030 is its alignment with the Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) model—interoperable platforms for identification, payments, and data exchange. The introduction of the
Fayda Digital ID
system and the expansion of the
EthioPay
digital payments framework symbolize Ethiopia’s commitment to inclusive financial and digital participation (National Bank of Ethiopia, 2024). These reforms are designed not only to increase efficiency but also to strengthen citizens’ trust in the state’s ability to deliver digital governance securely and transparently.
Moreover, the Startup Proclamation (No. 1220/2024) and the Data Protection Proclamation (No. 1218/2024) provide the regulatory backbone for innovation and privacy. The Startup Law offers fiscal incentives, incubation programs, and a regulatory sandbox for emerging technology sectors, while the Data Protection Law establishes accountability mechanisms in data usage, processing, and international transfer (MoIP, 2024). Together, these legislative measures mark Ethiopia’s transition from policy conceptualization to legal codification of digital sovereignty.
2. Telecommunications Liberalization and Infrastructure Scaling
Telecommunication sector liberalization is the fulcrum of Ethiopia’s DPI expansion. The partial privatization of Ethio Telecom and the licensing of Safaricom Ethiopia, a subsidiary of the Vodacom-led consortium, have fostered a competitive environment conducive to innovation and investment (AfDB, 2024). Broadband penetration increased from below 20 percent in 2020 to nearly 45 percent by 2025, partly due to the national fiber optic backbone project that extends connectivity to rural and industrial zones.
The 2030 roadmap envisions universal broadband access, guided by the principle of “digital equity.” Initiatives such as the Woredanet 2.0 and SchoolNet Digital Expansion programs are intended to close regional divides in access to education and e-governance services (MoIP, 2024). Parallel investments in data centers—specifically in the cities of Adama, Hawassa, and Bahir Dar—aim to support Ethiopia’s growing ambitions as a regional data hub, reducing reliance on external cloud infrastructure (Kassa, 2024).
3. Digital Sovereignty, Security, and Global Alignment
At the heart of Ethiopia’s digital ambitions lies the doctrine of digital sovereignty—the capacity of states to control their digital ecosystems, including data governance, infrastructure, and algorithmic transparency. The Data Protection Proclamation reflects Ethiopia’s determination to harmonize domestic regulations with international standards such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) while preserving national autonomy (Agarwal, 2025).
In geopolitical terms, Ethiopia’s pursuit of digital sovereignty aligns with the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) e-commerce protocol, which aims to reduce barriers for digital trade and cross-border data flows. By aligning national infrastructure projects with continental frameworks, Ethiopia is positioning itself as a reference point for “African data localization”—ensuring that data generated within Africa serves African development priorities rather than external profit logics (AUC, 2025).
Furthermore, Ethiopia’s active participation in multilateral initiatives such as the UN Global Digital Compact underscores its commitment to shaping equitable digital governance at a global level. This approach seeks to avert “digital colonialism,” where control over technological supply chains is disproportionately concentrated in advanced economies (United Nations, 2024).
Cybersecurity remains an evolving challenge. The establishment of the National Cyber Security Agency (NCSA) and the adoption of the National Cybersecurity Policy Framework (2025) introduced mechanisms for safeguarding national infrastructure and combating online misinformation, cyber-fraud, and foreign surveillance. The policy’s integration with the African Union’s regional Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (Malabo Convention) further situates Ethiopia’s digital sovereignty within a cooperative continental defense paradigm.
4. Financing the Digital Economy
The financial underpinnings of Ethiopia’s DE2030 are built upon hybrid public–private investment models. The collaboration between the New Development Bank (NDB), World Bank, and Africa50 forms the funding base for infrastructure expansion, with cumulative commitments exceeding USD 4 billion by 2025 (NDB, 2025).
Ethiopia’s approach emphasizes leveraging Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and ICT Innovation Hubs as investment catalysts. These zones—particularly in Hawassa, Dire Dawa, and Bole Lemi—function as platforms for digital startups and transnational technology partnerships. Financing mechanisms such as
Digital Infrastructure Bonds
and performance-linked financing are also being explored to sustain long-term infrastructure projects (Kassa, 2024).
5. Outlook and Challenges
While Ethiopia’s digital transformation is remarkable, implementation risks persist. Challenges include uneven connectivity in peripheral regions, limited private capital absorption, and insufficient skills development for an increasingly digital workforce. The government’s Digital Skills Initiative (DSI) aims to upskill five million Ethiopians by 2030, targeting gender parity and youth inclusion in STEM disciplines (MoLSA, 2025).
Another developmental concern lies in maintaining data ethics while capitalizing on AI applications in governance and agriculture. As Ethiopia scales AI-enabled systems, continuous monitoring of algorithmic transparency, human rights, and accessibility will be critical to ensuring technology enhances public welfare rather than exacerbating inequality.
6. Conclusion
Ethiopia’s DE2030 strategy represents a bold endeavor to redefine the intersection between technology, governance, and development. With institutional reforms, infrastructure expansion, and regional leadership, Ethiopia is redefining what digital sovereignty looks like in Africa: innovation-driven yet sovereignty-conscious, globally integrated yet locally anchored.
If implemented effectively, the Digital Ethiopia 2030 framework could propel Ethiopia’s transformation into a mid-income, knowledge-based economy while securing its role as a technological hub within the Horn of Africa and beyond.

Foreign policy is a set of principles of governments that defines their external relations with other countries. It also serves as an instrument to achieve the national interests of a nation. In implementing their foreign policy, governments manage their relations worldwide through their foreign ministries, embassies and consulates.
In general terms, the foreign policy of governments are targeting in promoting national interests, mainly economic, political, and security interests. In achieving their foreign policy governments use several ways that range from peaceful negotiation and diplomacy to the use of military power.
Some countries have developed their foreign policy towards continents. For instance, the US and the People’s Republic of China have designed their foreign policy towards Africa. In their policy they mention what kind of relationships they want to establish with the continent. On the other hand, the European Union, which is not a sovereign state, has also developed its own foreign policy for dealing with international affairs.
Having said this much about the general foreign policy, I will focus on Africa’s relations with other countries and continents. In the foreign policy document of China towards Africa, it is stated that China has an interest to “establish and develop a new type of strategic partnership with Africa, featuring political equality and mutual trust, economic win-win cooperation and cultural exchange”. Moreover, the policy also underlines that China will support Africa in the field of agriculture, economic aid, culture, environment, human resource development, medical assistance, debt relief and cancellation, increase cooperation in science and technology and the like.
Similarly the US has stated its foreign policy towards Africa by saying “…support for democracy and the strengthening of democratic institutions on the continent, including free, fair, and transparent elections; supporting African economic growth and development; conflict prevention, mitigation, and resolution; supporting presidential initiatives;…working with African nations on transnational issues such as drug smuggling, money laundering, illicit arms, and trafficking in persons”.
In order to translate their foreign policy towards Africa into practice some countries have established forums and partnerships with the African Union. African countries are also trying to utilize these forums for their own political and economic benefits. My argument on this issue is that the African Union should also have its own foreign policy in dealing with the rest of the world. Otherwise, there will be policy incoherence between Africa and other countries of the world.
Africa has 54 independent countries which have their own foreign policies. Taking this crude fact into consideration, one can argue that it is difficult to establish one foreign
policy for all African countries. But my argument is that Africa has common interests and issues that can be translated into foreign policy by which the continent can undertake joint actions.
Some of the common interests of African countries are the security and stability of the continent, sustainable economic development, good governance, democracy and human rights, technology transfer, development of culture, environment and the like. These common interests can be translated into foreign policy document of the continent. Such foreign policy would help Africa to be proactive than to be reactive to the policies and interests of other countries.
When we see the current trends and interaction of the African Union with other big countries it is possible to say that the latter develop their own foreign policies towards the former and either a forum or a partnership will be established. This means that Africa is fulfilling the agenda of the great countries. But this doesn’t mean that Africa is not getting some benefit from such interaction. Through such forums Africa could get political and economic benefits as well as a chance of experience-sharing in various fields. Just to mention one example, China built the new conference building of the African Union based on the partnership which has been established between them.
So far Africa as a continent has established strategic partnerships at various levels. These partnerships are at the level of continent-to-continent, continent-to-country and institution-to-institution. These partnerships are Africa-Turkey Partnership, Africa- Europe Partnership, Africa-South America partnership, Africa-India Forum Summit, Forum on China–Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) and the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) with Japan. I would like to argue that developing an African policy should get priority than establishing partnership or any other multilateral forums with big countries, continents and institutions.
The European Union, which comprises 28 member states, has its own foreign policy in interacting with others. The 1992 Treaty on European Union was a base for establishing the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) of the Union. Regarding the implementation of the foreign policy “most foreign and security policy decisions are taken by unanimity – all EU countries have to agree on a decision”. This decision-making process is a guarantee for member states in protecting the sovereignty of the country.
The foreign policy of the European Union deals with “international issues of a political or diplomatic nature, including issues with a security or military orientation”. The Union has established a broad set of principles that would help them in guiding the external relations and actions. But this doesn’t mean that member countries of the Union have stopped in exercising their own national foreign ministries and their own national foreign policies.
Similar to European countries, African counties have also a common ground that can be developed into a kind of “African Policy or African Engagement” with other countries
and entities. Such a policy would help Africa to have common positions on various international issues as well as to speak and act as one. Unlike the European Union, the establishment of African Standby Force under the African Union is a leap forward in maintaining peace and security in the continent. The basic principles of establishing the Standby Force can also be formulated into the security policy of the African Union.
The vision of the African Union is to have “an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa, driven by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force in the global arena”. From this vision it is clear that the African Union should not be driven by the agenda of other countries. In the absence of such foreign policy towards other countries, Africa will establish relationships based on the agenda and policy of other countries.
The presence of a common foreign policy will help Africa to have a clearly defined strategic partnership and approach to external relations. In designing the common foreign policy there is a need to have unanimous consensus among the member states of the African Union. However, the policy of the continent should not go down to specific policy details.
Africa should develop its own foreign policy which is a mechanism for adopting common principles and guidelines in interacting with other countries. Currently, the African Union is promoting the active participation and contribution of African peoples in the development and integration of the continent. To meet this objective the AU Commission has disclosed the fact that it will receive “inputs informing Agenda 2063 until November 2013.” I believe that the organization will give attention to the issue of common foreign policy of the African Union. I hope that my recommendation on the subject will be considered by the organization.

TITLE: Does the Expansion of BRICS Catalyze the Shifting of the World Order? – IFA

Introduction
There is a commonly heard Victor Hugo’s saying: “No one can resist an idea whose time has come”. The genesis of BRICS was one of such thoughts when the term was coined by Jim O’Neil in 2001. Originally, the term ascribed to the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China which could dominate the world economy by the year 2050 (The Economist, 2023). Some years later, under the initiation of Russia, those four countries announced the formation of a global economic giant dubbed as BRICs on June 16, 2009, at Yekaterinburg, Russia. At the midst, the absence of an African representative from the Global South forced the group to expand its footprint into Africa, resulting South Africa to become the first beneficiary of the BRICS expansion in the history of the bloc.
From the outset, BRICS founding members had conflicting positions on the expansion of BRICS. In particular, their negotiations for expansion faced significant pressure from China and Russia who advocated for the inclusion of more countries. In contrast, Brazil and India resisted, at least, China’s version of expansion (Daldegan, 2023). Setting aside their differences at the Johannesburg Summit, however, the bloc approved the integration of six new members, mainly from Middle East and North Africa region. These include Argentina, Ethiopia, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. The inclusion of these countries embolden the bloc’s long serving principle of consensus based approach (East Asia Forum, 2024), thereby structurally increasing their leverage in the global system – such as enabling to adjust the shifting world order in their favor.
It seems there is a growing consensus on the issue the contemporary world order is shifting toward a multipolar system. Alfred Mccony, the Nation Magazine Newsletter columnist, underscored, “The end of our world order is imminent”, predicting the inevitable dawn fall of the “American designed global order”. In this context, the recent expansion of the BRICS alliance system could further catalyze this shift in a meaningful manner. Several MENA countries which have been traditionally US strong allies now joined the BRICS group. That means, in principle, those MENA countries share the group’s core values and goals, such as the establishment of a multipolar international order without hegemony and the formation of a fairer global governance system (Haibin, 2013). Beyond that the expansion could promote the notion of South-South cooperation, as leverage when time permits.
The Expansion of BRICS and South-South Cooperation
The BRICS group endorsed the principle of South-South Cooperation (SSC) since its inception. SSC refers to “
a process whereby two or more developing countries pursue their individual and/or shared national capacity development objectives through exchanges of knowledge and skills.
”
Perhaps relying on this definition, Zhu Jiejin (2015) distinguished between traditional and new SSC models. He characterized the new SSC model in light of substantive elements like mutual respect, equal treatment, mutual benefit based on win-win approaches. Consequently, the new SSC model seeks to the establishment of new international platforms or fundamental transformation in major global institutions. On the other hand, the traditional SSC model insisted on reasonable rights for developing countries in the international system. The impetus of this model is, therefore, reforming existing international systems.
The distinct categories of SSC models offer the esteemed reader to pose: Does the expanded BRICS vow the reformation of the existing international order or advocate for its fundamental transformation. At the moment, the preference of MENA-dominated BRICS seemed to incline towards the traditional SSC model. For instance, the position of Saudi Arabia and UAE could be cited as a best fit to the traditional SSC model – they might not seek a fundamental change in the US liberal world order. This is because for years “the Gulf was firmly in the US’s orbit with relationships founded on the unwritten compact that Washington would be their security guarantor while Arab oil producers ensured stable global energy supplies” (Financial Times, 2023).  The position of Ethiopia is apparently concurrent with this traditional model. Ethiopia’s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, reiterated that his countries motive behind joining BRICS is not to support, oppose, or harm any group (Xinhua, 2023).
On the contrary, BRICS dominant founding countries, such as China and Russia’s perspective appears to coincide with the new SSC model. Chinese president, Xi Jinping, for instance, called for a new form of international relations where hegemony is over (United States Institute of Peace, 2023). In general, though the Johannesburg BRICS expansion may show the direction that the BRICS motive in the future is resorting to the traditional SSC model
,
the preference of the BRICS bloc pertaining to seeking a reformation or a fundamental transformation in the international order needs further investigation
Conclusion and Policy Recommendation
It is hoped that the expansion of BRICS catalyzes the shifting of the world order in favor of the Global South. Against all odds, BRICS could play a vital role in enhancing the South-South cooperation, as the bloc endorsed the principle since its inception. Besides, the formation of the New Development Bank epitomizes the desire of BRICS countries to play a bigger role in the global financial governance, serving as an alternative source of financial system. In this perspective, Ethiopia’s entry into BRICS can be considered as a “golden opportunity”, enhancing its existing relations with Global Powers such as Russia and China. Indeed, the country should insist on the “golden mean” in its foreign relations to escape any hit back from the Western countries. The golden mean would balance Ethiopia’s relation with its traditional Western allies on one hand and members of the expanded BRICS, on the other hand. In general, Ethiopia needs to navigate vigilantly in such a way that BRICS’ membership yields more benefits than costs.

The Horn Dialogue Series IV continued on Monday with a dynamic third panel titled “Innovation, Financing, and Emerging Challenges in Future Peacekeeping,” bringing together leading experts to explore how Africa can secure sustainable financing and harness technology for more effective peace operations.
The session, moderated by Henok Getachew, featured Prof. Kasaija Phillip Apuuli, Bitania Tadesse, Abdirahman Aynte, and Dr. Dawit Yohannes.
Panelists tackled pressing questions: How will hybrid funding models such as UNSCR 2719 reshape African peace support operations? What alternative mechanisms can ensure predictable and sustainable financing for African-led missions? And how can innovation—from AI and digital tools to drones and data systems—strengthen the future of peacekeeping while guarding against disinformation and cyber threats?
Prof. Kasaija Phillip Apuuli emphasized that real transformation begins with strengthening homegrown approaches. “African solutions to African problems must be backed by African initiatives, African financing, and African leadership,” he said. He urged AU member states to contribute to peace operations according to their GDP or level of economic development, ensuring both ownership and accountability.
Discussions also underscored the need for smarter partnerships, institutional adaptation, and tech-enabled systems to modernize peacekeeping across the Horn of Africa and beyond.
The panel forms part of the two-day Horn Dialogue Series IV, organized to chart pathways for peacekeeping “with an African reality” beyond 2025.

This excerpt is an extension of an article published on IFA’s
website
in April. The previous article provided a general introduction to Ethiopia’s recent quest for sea access and the mechanisms it intends to employ to achieve this goal. However, it did not explore in-depth the strategic costs it endured being landlocked for the past four decades, despite its geographic proximity to one of the busiest maritime routes in the world, the Red Sea. This policy brief, therefore, assesses what Ethiopia has lost due to its landlocked status from a variety of angles. By examining these issues, one can better understand Ethiopia’s recent intentions to sea access in the Red Sea region while keeping intact the interests of its littoral neighbors.
Summary of Key Points
Ethiopia’s lack of sea access reduced its trade efficiency, incurs high transportation costs, limited or lower foreign direct investment, high rate of unemployment, and a 20-30% reduced economic growth compared to its littoral neighbors.
Keeping other factors constant, the transit costs for goods that Ethiopia pays to transit port have increased from USD 500,000 per day in the early 2000s to USD 2 million in 2013, and recently to USD 5 million per day.
As a regional security anchor in the Horn of Africa and the eastern half of the Southern Red Sea gate, Ethiopia’s role in regional security has been hindered by its lack of direct access to the sea.
Economic Development Perspectives
For a secure economic future, states engage in
economic exchanges
, often through trade with other nations(Lie, 2017; Oh, 2017). This exchange is facilitated by the export and import of goods and services to and from the international market. Ports play a significant role in facilitating these international trade transactions. One
major determinant
of economic development, therefore, is access to the sea. Access to the sea enhances trade efficiency, reduces transportation costs (both to and from the ports and the mainland), attracts foreign direct investment (FDI) due to geographic advantages, creates additional jobs, and stimulates economic growth. Therefore, direct access to the sea is considered a crucial engine for a nation’s economic development.
Studies show that a 10% increase in port efficiency results in a
2-3% increase
in a country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per year. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has also highlighted that landlocked countries, depending on their distance from the sea, experience an
average of 20-30%
lower economic development compared to those with coastal access. The farther a country is from the coast, the lower its economic development tends to be, primarily because a significant portion of its revenues is spent on transit costs – payable to those providing access. As the largest landlocked country with one of the fastest-growing economies in the world (IMF, 2024), Ethiopia is potentially losing 20-30% of its economic growth each year compared to the global average. Furthermore, when compared to its coastal neighbors, Ethiopia shows a
43% lower annual
economic growth rate. This disparity is largely attributable to the high transaction costs it incurs when relying on transit states in the Horn of Africa. Specifically, the transit costs Ethiopia currently pays to Djibouti Port for a 20-foot or 40-foot equivalent container is among the highest in the world.
In the same vein, the exports of landlocked countries tend to be
less diversified
, and their export structures are generally narrower compared to those of coastal states. This results in significantly lower and more expensive international trade. For example, transportation costs from Djibouti port to and from Addis Ababa
consume 16% of the value
of goods on the international market. Keeping other factors constant, Ethiopia’s transit costs to the Djibouti port rose from half a million USD per day in the early
2000s to two million
in 2013 and have now surpassed
five million
USD per day.
Similarly, landlocked countries face increased
vulnerability to external shocks
that can undermine their prospects for sustained economic development. Much of their exports consist of primary products, such as agricultural goods, which are often seasonal and depend on favorable weather conditions. This leads to inconsistencies in their supply to external markets, and they sometimes experience low prices. Additionally, since their import-export activities rely on transit through other states, landlocked countries are often
forced to prioritize
certain items. The cost of diversifying their trade is more than twice that of transit countries.
The import-export diversification costs for non-littoral states is
50% higher
than those of their counterparts. This is particularly severe for states that rely solely on one transit access point – impose additional costs whenever they needed. More importantly, their remoteness from the sea hampers the competitiveness of their firms and products in the global market. Although Ethiopia is a State without Access (SWA), it is not an enclave, which allows for the possibility of diversifying its transit access points by negotiating with coastal states. However, for decades, over 90% of Ethiopia’s import-export volume has depended exclusively on one transit access point, the Djibouti port. As a result, its import-export volume is less diversified, incurring substantial transit costs and suffering from poor service quality. Therefore, diversifying access to the sea could help mitigate transit-related costs and enhance competitiveness, ultimately increasing import-export volumes and contributing to sustained economic growth and development. Recently, there has been an initiative to import-export of a few non-containerized items through Berbera and Tadjourah. This initiative should be expanded to include other similar ports in the Horn of Africa by building corridors and trade connectivity, providing Ethiopia with the opportunity to diversify both its import-export items and access points.
Strategic Security Perspectives
Ethiopia is located in the Horn of Africa (HoA), a region that is both one of the
most strategic
locations on Earth and one of the most conflict-ridden. As a result, Ethiopia is
highly vulnerable
to increasing national and regional security threats. These threats are dynamic and rapidly evolving. To effectively address these growing security concerns, access to the sea is crucial, as naval and military facilities can serve as
docking points
and launching pads to combat issues such as organized piracy, arms trafficking, and terrorism.
In light of the complex and ambiguous maritime threats in the Red Sea region, a comprehensive counterstrategy is necessary, emphasizing access to maritime domains. Ethiopia’s role as a regional security anchor in the Horn of Africa and the eastern part of the southern Red Sea is hindered by its lack of direct sea access. Establishing transit access would not only reduce vulnerability to regional and national security threats but also
enhance the state’s ability
to respond to various threats through land, air, and naval means. Being landlocked and reliant on a single transit point provided by a neighboring country has exposed Ethiopia to multiple challenges, including terrorism, piracy, cross-border crime, and espionage.
Given the transnational nature of security threats and the fragile state of countries in the Horn of Africa, along with the proliferation of threats in the region, it is crucial for Ethiopia to secure direct sea access and maintain a
naval and military presence
along the Red Sea coasts. This strategy enhances Ethiopia’s maritime interests and secures its borders. Some studies suggest that certain African states became landlocked
due to colonialism
, which involved the drawing of artificial borders that caused them to lose their former sea access. As a result, these states may be reluctant to provide access to their landlocked neighbors, even at contractual basis, driven by unfounded suspicions that their neighbors may claim permanent access based on historical or ancestral narratives while they are wide open for foreign naval basis and military facilities.
As a regional anchor in the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia possesses modern and versatile
military power
that could significantly enhance both regional and national security if granted direct sea access. Following the Ethiopia-Eritrean rapprochement in mid-2018, for instance, geopolitical and security analysts noted a
new wave of hope
in the Horn of Africa. This positive shift also led to negotiations regarding the Eritrea-Djibouti conflict and the signing of a tripartite
peace and friendship
agreement among Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia. Although these developments were short-lived, they contributed to an improved regional peace and security landscape. Consequently, Ethiopia’s direct access to maritime routes in the Red Sea not only mitigates national security vulnerabilities but also bolsters regional security cooperation.
Regional Security Perspectives
On the other hand, sea access enhances a state’s geopolitical and regional influence, allowing it to play a more prominent role in regional affairs and to establish stronger ties with its neighbors. As a civilizational state in the region, Ethiopia has been significantly involved in regional affairs. It helped establish various regional mechanisms including the Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD) and its functional agencies, to facilitate regional economic integration and security cooperation. The region’s peace and security heavily depend on
Ethiopia’s unwavering
contribution to regional peacekeeping. Additionally, Ethiopia is a founding member of the
Djibouti Code of Conduct
, signed by Red Sea member states to combat piracy and armed robbery against ships in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Indian Ocean. It has also played significant roles in the fight against terrorism in the horn of Africa. However, Ethiopia was excluded from the recently established Red Sea Council due to narrow criterion of lacking direct sea access. Gaining sea access could have strengthened Ethiopia’s efforts toward regional integration and security, positioning it as a hegemon capable of summoning others in the region. Unfortunately, its lack of sea access has contributed to weak regional integration and diminished regional security, hindering Ethiopia’s role and influence in both regional and global affairs.
Concluding Remarks
Sea access is a critical engine for a nation’s long-term development because it facilitates trade transactions, lowers import-export transit costs, limits strategic security vulnerabilities, and strengthens regional security integration and cooperation. In contrast, landlocked countries frequently face significant challenges, such as high transit costs and limited trade transactions. Their lack of naval and military presence along coastlines makes them vulnerable to increasing national and regional security threats, restricting their maneuverability, detection, and response capabilities.
Ethiopia, despite its historical ties to the Red Sea, has faced limited economic development due to its recent landlocked status, resulting in economic unrest and increased vulnerability to escalating national and regional security threats. The recent push for sea access in the Red Sea region is a response to these growing vulnerabilities. However, Ethiopia’s efforts have been met with challenges from its littoral neighbors, owing to a misunderstanding of Ethiopia’s genuine intentions to address these economic and security concerns. As a major economic and military power in the region, Ethiopia’s access to the sea may benefit the region more than Ethiopia itself by facilitating trade connectivity and regional security cooperation. Allowing sea access to Ethiopia, therefore, not only helps the country address its national challenges but also enhances regional security in the Red Sea area. Hence, Ethiopia’s sea access should be approached from such perspectives instead of an ambition to evade sovereignty of littoral neighbors.

TITLE: Geopolitics of Trade: Why Ethiopia Must Balance Sovereignty and Global Market Access – IFA

There is an African Proverb often quoted in trade diplomacy circles,
“If you are not at the table, you are probably on the menu.”
And I expound it as ‘if you show up without a plan, you might just be the appetizer’. Here’s what that really means in Ethiopia’s trade context. Let’s break it down; Trade has never been purely about economics. Especially in the Horn of Africa, it is deeply entangled with political positioning, foreign influence and the enduring pursuit of sovereignty. Ethiopia’s long-stalled accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
[1]
, its participation in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and its shifting alliances with China, the West and Gulf actors reflect a country caught between competing imperatives: to protect national autonomy while also securing access to global markets.
As someone engaged in the stream of diplomacy, youth empowerment and education reform, I believe Ethiopia must reject the false binary of sovereignty vs. trade liberalization. The way forward lies in a strategic balancing act anchoring trade policy in national priorities while leveraging regional and global partnerships with clarity, skill and foresight.
Ethiopia’s Strategic Dilemma: Trade as a Political Choice
Ethiopia applied for WTO membership in 2003 and, after thirteen Working-Party sessions, now targets accession by the 14th WTO Ministerial in 2026 on the back of bold reforms that have pried open telecoms, finance and logistics to competition.
[2]
However, the finishing line remains contentious at home: skeptics warn premature liberalization could swamp small farmers and fledgling banks, while advocates counter that staying outside the rules-based system will keep investor confidence low and leave Ethiopia voiceless when trade disputes arise.
At the same time, Addis Ababa is a founding signatory of the AfCFTA, theoretically entitled to tariff-free entry into a continental market of 1.4 billion people. In practice, customs delays, thin transport corridors and stubborn non-tariff barriers still choke that promise.
To hedge the gap, Ethiopia has turned to a patchwork of bilateral deals: Chinese Belt-and-Road rail finance, Gulf logistics capital and Western preference schemes such as AGOA each partner arriving with its own (sometimes unspoken) expectations on access and influence.
The strategic choice therefore is not
whether
to liberalize but how to choreograph the opening on Ethiopia’s terms. A phased WTO deal leveraging special-and-differential treatment, ring-fencing sensitive sectors and insisting on capacity-building from partners would let Ethiopia enjoy global market access without surrendering sovereignty. In short, Ethiopia must own both the timetable and the terms of its trade future.
The Hidden Cost of Overdependence
Trade can be wielded like a tool or a weapon. When the United States suspended Ethiopia’s African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) benefits in 2021, thousands of mostly female textile workers in Hawassa Industrial Park saw orders vanish overnight.
[3]
At the other end of the spectrum, Beijing’s concessional lending instrumental in delivering the Addis-Djibouti Railway; now prompts legitimate scrutiny over long-term debt sustainability and operational sovereignty.
[4]
Ethiopia must not be seen as a passive casualty of global trade politics, but as a sovereign actor capable of turning pressure into strategy. The suspension of AGOA and the debt entanglements from projects like the Addis-Djibouti Railway reveal an uncomfortable truth: trade partnerships are rarely neutral.
Nevertheless these events also offer a crucial lesson, dependency is not destiny. Rather than accept the terms handed down by more powerful actors, Ethiopia should view every shock be it a suspended trade privilege or a conditional loan as a strategic signal to diversify its export base, strengthen its regional linkages under AfCFTA, and refine its debt governance mechanisms. Geopolitical friction, when approached with clarity and intent, can serve as a catalyst for smarter diplomacy and more resilient economic planning. Trade is not merely a channel for growth, it is a mirror reflecting the country’s bargaining posture and capacity to innovate under pressure.
The slow pace of Ethiopia’s WTO accession does not indicate reluctance, but rather the gravity of the reforms required to meet the bar. These aren’t cosmetic adjustments instead they are systemic overhauls enhancing monetary and fiscal policy alignment, improving the transparency of State-Owned Enterprises, liberalizing trading rights and replacing administrative discretion with rule-based customs protocols. Each task demands not only legal reform but also institutional strength, data infrastructure and inter-agency coordination. But here’s the opportunity: Ethiopia does not have to replicate models from more developed economies. Instead, it can craft a trade architecture that aligns with its own development realities one that liberalizes at a measured pace, protects emerging industries and maintains policy flexibility. The goal should not be blind integration, but intelligent engagement trade policy as an extension of national will. In doing so, Ethiopia can ensure that its entry into the global market is not an act of surrender, but a declaration of sovereignty on its own terms.
Reframing Sovereignty: From Protectionism to Strategy
True sovereignty is not isolation; it is the ability to make informed, autonomous decisions in a complex international system. Ethiopia’s decision-makers must resist both extremes:
Blind liberalization, which risks undermining domestic industries and
Overprotection, which discourages innovation and foreign investment.
Instead, a graduated approach to global market integration is needed one that:
Prioritizes strategic sectors (like agriculture, logistics and digital trade),
Implements smart safeguards to protect vulnerable populations,
And builds negotiation capacity within Ethiopia’s ministries, trade missions and youth leadership pipelines.
Diplomacy Is the Missing Piece
Trade and diplomacy cannot be separated. Ethiopia must actively shape the rules of trade engagement, not simply react to them. This means,
Re-engaging WTO Accession with Clear Red Lines:
Ethiopia must fully harness its status as a Least Developed Country (LDC) at the WTO, not as a plea for charity, but as a strategic right grounded in global development justice. Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) provisions offer more than transition periods and technical support; they are a lifeline for countries charting their own development paths amid global asymmetries. Ethiopia should push boldly for sector-specific safeguards and policy space while it still qualifies, using the LDC window to lock in favorable terms that reflect its economic structure and social priorities. However graduation from LDC status must not be viewed as the end of leverage; it should signal a shift in posture, from cautious negotiation to confident agenda-setting. As a country on the rise with regional influence and an energetic youth population, Ethiopia has every reason to approach WTO accession not with submissiveness but with vision. Through smart alliances under AfCFTA and COMESA, it can defend vital sectors like agriculture and digital trade, while crafting a post-LDC trade policy rooted in resilience, flexibility and long-term national interest. Ethiopia’s engagement with the global trading system must reflect the country it aspires to be not just today, but in the decade ahead sovereign, strategic and unapologetically self-defined.
Using AfCFTA as a Leverage Tool:
Through embracing and deepening its integration within AfCFTA, Ethiopia gains a strengthened regional voice that demands fairer and more balanced terms in global arenas like the WTO. This continental partnership aligns perfectly with Ethiopia’s ongoing reforms, helping to break down non-tariff barriers and build resilient value chains that reduce reliance on a narrow set of external markets. AfCFTA offers Ethiopia not only economic diversification but also the political leverage to negotiate from a position of strength, anchored in a collective African agenda that truly reflects the continent’s development needs. In this light, Ethiopia is no longer a lone player reacting to global trade pressures, it is a proud and purposeful contributor to shaping the rules of the game.
Training the Next Generation of Economic Diplomats:
I have never failed to state this agenda wherever I engage, since building a strong foundation for Ethiopia’s future begins at the root. Ethiopia must cultivate youth trade diplomats who understand geopolitics, economics, science and negotiation. Programs like a “Young Trade Envoys Fellowship” can equip future negotiators with the tools to defend national interests in global trade forums.
Recap: The Path Ahead-Trade as a Sovereign Act
The real challenge for Ethiopia is not whether to engage in global trade, but how to do so with clear strategy, national purpose and dignity. Trade is more than tariffs and quotas. It is a political decision deeply linked to our foreign policy, education and economic vision. When Ethiopia shapes trade policy through the lens of national interest and informed diplomacy; it sends a clear message to the world…
“We are open for business, but not at any cost. We are ready to lead, but not to be led blindly. We value global access, but not at the expense of national dignity!”
Ethiopia must move from being a passive rule-taker to an active rule-shaper, leveraging regional alliances, industrial growth and the energy of a new generation. Bold leadership must align trade with job creation, climate resilience, innovation and regional unity. Trade should empower Ethiopia, strengthening its sovereignty and peace  rather than compromising it. By choosing strategic engagement over passive adaptation, Ethiopia can write its own economic story on its own terms.
For Ethiopia, the choice is not between sovereignty and markets. It is between passive adaptation and strategic engagement. The future of Ethiopian trade will not be built in Geneva or Washington alone, it will be shaped in Addis Ababa, in regional forums and in the minds of the country’s emerging generation of diplomats, economists and entrepreneurs. Trade must serve the people, protect national resilience and unlock prosperity not just for a few exporters, but for a nation ready to rise.

Background: Reform, Rupture, and Continuity
Since 2018, Ethiopia has undergone a profound foreign policy recalibration shaped by domestic political transition, ideological reorientation, and changing regional geopolitics. The ascent of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed marked the end of an era dominated by security-first diplomacy and highly centralized coalition governance. At the same time, the Horn of Africa experienced escalating instability Sudan’s political crisis, Somalia’s fragile state-building trajectory, Eritrea’s shifting alignments, and intensifying competition over the Red Sea corridor. Against this backdrop, Ethiopia’s foreign policy evolved through a hybrid approach that combines reformist and economic diplomacy with the understanding of the definition of interest as national and common which shift from the predominant definition of national interest as a guiding policy of state. This briefing examines the structural drivers of Ethiopia’s post-2018 foreign policy, the contradictions emerging from this transition, and key implications for regional engagement.
Ethiopia’s foreign policy shift cannot be understood without considering the broader political reconfiguration after 2018. Abiy’s early outreach particularly the normalization of relations with Eritrea signaled a departure from the EPRDF’s threat-driven security doctrine (Abbink, 2019). His government framed this transformation through the philosophy of
Medemer
, which emphasizes synergy, reconciliation, and interdependence (Abiy, 2019). High-profile state visits to Djibouti, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan embodied a diplomatic offensive grounded in soft-power engagement and regional integration.
Yet, these openings unfolded alongside deep domestic turbulence, including the 2020–2022 war in northern Ethiopia, rising ethno-nationalist contestation, and widening political fragmentation. These internal dynamics frequently undermined external commitments, revealing the limits of early optimism (Clapham, 2021). Thus, Ethiopia’s post-2018 foreign policy reflects both reformist aspirations and structural continuities rooted in domestic instability.
Key drivers of Ethiopia’s evolving Horn policy
Ethiopia’s evolving Horn of Africa policy is shaped by several interrelated drivers. First, the ideological influence of Medemer (Abiy, 2019) introduced a vision of cooperative regional engagement built on partnership, connectivity, and economic interdependence. This orientation informed Ethiopia’s renewed commitment to IGAD, its push for cross-border infrastructure, and its “neighborhood first” diplomatic posture. Although this framework aimed to shift Ethiopia’s image from security hegemon to regional integration champion, limitations in institutional capacity have reduced its transformative potential.
Second, Ethiopia’s foreign policy has been increasingly driven by economic imperatives, particularly market liberalization, infrastructure expansion, and the structural challenge of landlockedness. Diversifying sea access, reducing overreliance on Djibouti, and strengthening transport and energy linkages with Kenya, Sudan, and South Sudan have become core priorities (World Bank, 2020). The renewed maritime access debates of 2023–2024 underscored Ethiopia’s need to secure cost-effective and politically sustainable trade routes, elevating economic diplomacy as a central tool of external engagement.
Third, intensifying geopolitical competition in the Red Sea has significantly shaped Ethiopia’s strategic environment. Egyptian activism over the GERD, rivalry among Gulf States, Turkey’s expanding footprint, and the growing presence of both the United States and China have created a more complex regional landscape (International Crisis Group, 2023). These dynamics constrain Ethiopia’s choices but also provide opportunities for selective alignment. Ethiopia’s revived naval ambitions and renewed maritime focus reflects its effort to maintain strategic relevance in an increasingly militarized Red Sea corridor.
Fourth, evolving alliances and regional mistrust have further complicated Ethiopia’s diplomatic trajectory. Relations with Eritrea deteriorated following the Pretoria Agreement, with Asmara’s continued use of internal proxies as part of its foreign policy; the 2024 MoU with Somaliland triggered a diplomatic rupture with Somalia; and tensions with Sudan over al-Fashaga remain unresolved (Lefort, 2022). Many of these tensions arise from the intersection of Ethiopia’s domestic political dynamics and regional concerns about its long-term strategic intentions.
Challenges Undermining the Neighborhood First Policy
Ethiopia’s “neighborhood first” policy, despite its cooperative ambitions, continues to be undermined by deep-rooted structural and political challenges across the Horn of Africa. The region remains characterized by a persistent trust deficit shaped by decades of historical grievances, unresolved border disputes, and divergent security priorities among neighboring states. These long-standing tensions have made it difficult for Ethiopia’s recent diplomatic overtures to gain full credibility, as states continue to interpret its actions through the lens of past rivalries and asymmetrical power relations. Differences in political worldviews and governance models further complicate regional engagement, creating ideological distance between Ethiopia and some of its neighbors.
The debate over sea access has intensified these anxieties. While Ethiopia’s pursuit of reliable maritime outlets reflects a fundamental economic necessity and concerns related to state survival, many neighboring countries perceive this quest with suspicion due to historical reasons, unworthy reasoning, and purposive misunderstanding. Nationalist political narratives across the region especially in Somalia and Eritrea frame Ethiopia’s maritime aspirations as potential precursors to renewed hegemonic behavior or territorial encroachment which will not help actually for integration and cooperation and mislead the rationality. These fears, often amplified by domestic politics and media discourse, have constrained opportunities for constructive negotiation, making even economically rational proposals vulnerable to political backlash. The result is a regional environment where cooperative intent is easily overshadowed by entrenched mistrust and competing strategic narratives.
Conclusion
Ethiopia’s foreign policy trajectory since 2018 has evolved into a hybrid model ambitious in its strategic vision, increasingly institutionalized and consistently challenged by internal vulnerabilities and regional pressures. The shift toward cooperation, regional connectivity, and economic diplomacy represents a marked departure from the historically security-centered and militarized approach that dominated Ethiopia’s engagement with its neighbors for decades. This reorientation reflects a recognition that long-term stability and growth depend on mutually beneficial partnerships, integrated markets, and reduced geopolitical frictions within the Horn of Africa.
Bridging the gap between the aspirational ideals of
Medemer
and the complex realities of Horn of Africa politics therefore requires deliberate and sustained efforts. Ethiopia must further re-institutionalize its foreign policy apparatus, build predictable diplomatic channels, and invest in long-term trust-building with its neighbors. Only through such a coherent and confidence-enhancing approach can Ethiopia secure its strategic interests such as diversified sea access, regional stability, and economic integration while contributing meaningfully to a more peaceful and cooperative Horn of Africa.

TITLE: Ethiopia’s Posture and Policy Architecture for the 2025 G20 Johannesburg Summit – IFA

Introduction
The 20th Summit of the Group of Twenty (G20), convened in Johannesburg, South Africa, marked a historic moment for Africa within global economic governance. For the first time, African voices—represented by the African Union as a permanent G20 member—held a decisive role in shaping the agenda for sustainable growth, digital equity, and climate resilience. For Ethiopia, a leading diplomatic power in the Horn of Africa and a champion of continental integration, the summit provided both a diplomatic opportunity and a developmental imperative. It demonstrated Ethiopia’s evolving statecraft: positioning itself as a bridge between developing economies and major economic powers while advancing an African-led policy consensus around equitable growth, the energy transition, and innovation governance (African Union Commission [AUC], 2025; Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ethiopia [MoFA], 2025).
Strategic Anchors: From National Vision to Global Advocacy
Ethiopia’s engagement at the 2025 G20 Summit is underpinned by its domestic policy frameworks, particularly the
Digital Ethiopia 2025
strategy and its successor,
Digital Ethiopia 2030 (DE2030)
. These frameworks seek to transform Ethiopia into a digitally driven economy with equitable access to technology and opportunities (World Bank, 2024). DE2030 expands the original digital strategy by placing greater emphasis on ethical artificial intelligence (AI) development, cybersecurity, and cross-border data governance. This domestic focus aligns with the global G20 agenda on shaping safe and inclusive digital economies.
At the same time, Ethiopia’s
Climate-Resilient Green Economy (CRGE)
strategy serves as a foundation for its energy diplomacy within the G20. The nation’s messaging at the Johannesburg summit centered around advancing a
Just Energy Transition
—promoting clean energy access without compromising growth trajectories. Ethiopia’s argument is framed through the normative lens of
Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC)
, which posits that industrialized nations must bear a greater burden for financing Africa’s transition to renewable energy (African Development Bank [AfDB], 2024).
Leveraging its vast potential for hydropower, solar, and geothermal energy, Ethiopia called for multilateral support in scaling renewable infrastructure through debt-for-climate swaps, concessional financing, and technology sharing. This position resonated with continental initiatives such as the AU’s
Addis Ababa Declaration on Climate Change and Call to Action
(AUC, 2025), reinforcing Ethiopia’s leadership in the global South’s collective demand for climate justice.
Digital Sovereignty and the Fight against “Digital Colonialism”
A major dimension of Ethiopia’s strategy at the G20 was the advocacy for equitable digital governance. The emergence of an AI-driven global economy presents both opportunities and risks for developing states. Ethiopia’s intervention on
Artificial Intelligence Governance
emphasized closing the digital divide while preventing what its delegation termed “digital colonialism”—a situation where technological dependency perpetuates structural inequities between the Global North and South (Kassa, 2024).
Under the DE2030 framework, Ethiopia promotes principles of
digital sovereignty
, advocating for open data ecosystems, localized innovation ecosystems, and regional cloud infrastructure built on African regulatory frameworks. By aligning these proposals with the African Union’s ongoing work to establish a
Continental Artificial Intelligence Strategy
, Ethiopia positioned itself as a policy entrepreneur within the G20 digital inclusion agenda (Agarwal, 2025). These advocacy efforts drew inspiration from the UN’s
Global Digital Compact
, highlighting the country’s commitment to a digital order that upholds ethical standards, inclusivity, and transparency (United Nations, 2024).
Finance, Fairness, and Reforming Global Economic Institutions
Beyond sectoral initiatives, Ethiopia’s diplomacy at the Johannesburg Summit was guided by the principle of structural reform within international financial governance. As a member state closely tied to the
BRICS+
architecture, Ethiopia endorsed calls for a more representative global financial system focused on sustainable development financing and debt relief for developing economies (BRICS Secretariat, 2024).
Ethiopia’s delegation underscored the mismatch between Africa’s demographic and resource endowments and its limited representation in global decision-making bodies. Its proposals included the expansion of the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) for low-income countries and the redirection of climate finance through multilateral development banks such as the African Development Bank and the New Development Bank (NDB, 2025). These mechanisms, Ethiopia argued, could bolster Africa’s fiscal space without deepening debt distress.
The Ethiopian Prime Minister’s address also echoed themes of
developmental multilateralism
, calling for an integrated approach to trade, climate adaptation, and digital infrastructure. Such positions were critical in reinforcing Ethiopia’s identity as both a reformist and a bridge-builder between the Global South and established economic powers (Ahmed, 2025).
Pan-African Coordination and Leadership
Ethiopia’s participation in the Johannesburg Summit illustrated the convergence between its domestic reforms and its continental diplomacy. As host of the African Union Headquarters and a permanent voice within Africa’s G20 delegation, Ethiopia coordinated closely with South Africa, Nigeria, and Egypt to articulate a common African position on global equity, technology transfer, and sustainable industrialization.
By linking national strategies to Agenda 2063’s flagship projects—including the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System—Ethiopia reinforced the message that Africa’s integration is indispensable to global prosperity (AUC, 2025). This cooperative posture underscored Ethiopia’s transformation from a largely aid-dependent economy into a diplomatic actor advocating for fairness, autonomy, and shared advancement.
Conclusion: A Catalyst for African Voice and Vision
Ethiopia’s policy architecture at the 2025 G20 Summit embodies the country’s broader transition from inward development planning to proactive global engagement. Grounded in its technological modernization agenda and commitment to green growth, its diplomacy in Johannesburg provided a template for how African economies can negotiate a seat at the table of global governance—on their own terms.
By promoting
Just Energy Transition
,
Digital Sovereignty
, and
Global Institutional Reform
, Ethiopia positioned itself not as a peripheral observer but as a key player in the reconfiguration of economic power. In doing so, it reaffirmed its status as a continental thought leader navigating a rapidly transforming global landscape.

Ethiopia continues to strengthen its position as a leading advocate for peace, stability, and reconstruction across Africa. The opening of the 17th International Training on Post-Conflict Stabilization and Reconstruction in Addis Ababa highlighted the country’s growing influence in shaping dialogue on conflict recovery and sustainable development.
Organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Romania in partnership with Ethiopia’s Institute of Foreign Affairs (IFA), the program reflects a shared understanding that building lasting peace requires cooperation between local, regional, and global actors. It also demonstrates Ethiopia’s readiness to transform its own experiences in peacebuilding into lessons and inspiration for the continent.
H.E. Jafar Bedru, Executive Director of IFA, emphasized that African nations are working diligently to move from instability toward sustainable peace and stronger institutions. He noted that the diversity of participants from across Africa, representing a wide range of experiences and perspectives, stands as one of the program’s greatest strengths. This diversity, he said, reflects Africa’s collective will to lead its own path toward stability.
“Your presence here demonstrates our shared belief that post-conflict reconstruction must be led by local actors, strengthened through regional cooperation, and supported by global partnerships,” he stated.
H.E. Jafar also underscored Ethiopia’s National Dialogue and Transitional Justice process as a central pillar of its peacebuilding journey. These initiatives are designed to heal divisions, rebuild trust, and strengthen national unity. They also serve as examples of Ethiopia’s homegrown approach to resolving internal challenges through dialogue rather than confrontation.
IFA, he added, continues to serve as a bridge between diplomacy and peacebuilding, equipping diplomats, policymakers, and regional actors with the tools and knowledge needed to promote peace and cooperation.
H.E. Lulia Pataki, Ambassador of Romania to Ethiopia, described the training as a cornerstone of Romania’s Africa strategy. She highlighted that the program’s focus on combating disinformation is particularly timely, as misinformation continues to threaten peace, stability, and development across the world. She noted that this forum creates valuable opportunities for connection, learning, and the exchange of expertise on how to prevent instability and rebuild societies.
H.E. Daniela Dobre, Director General of the Romanian Agency for International Development, added that the training has evolved from a technical initiative into a genuine platform for dialogue and collaboration. Bringing together civilian and military experts, policymakers, and practitioners from across Africa and beyond, the program underscores the power of cooperation in shaping shared solutions.
“The last three editions have shown us that collaboration and knowledge sharing are among the most powerful tools for building peace and stability,” she observed.
Ethiopia’s active engagement in this initiative once again highlights its role as both a participant and a leader in continental peacebuilding. By sharing its experiences and promoting African-led solutions, the country continues to demonstrate that stability, dialogue, and institutional resilience are essential foundations for the continent’s collective progress.
The five-day program combines theoretical and practical sessions aimed at strengthening regional capacity, encouraging collaboration, and empowering African nations to turn shared challenges into opportunities for peace, growth, and sustainable reconstruction.

TITLE: Beyond the Fray: Africa’s Agency Amidst a Contentious Global Trade Order – IFA

As the global order teeters on the precipice of transformation, two intersecting conflicts, one geopolitical and the other economic, are reshaping the contours of international relations. In both of these unfolding dramas, Africa finds itself conspicuously marginalized, left to navigate the shifting tides of global power without a seat at the table. The first is a maritime security crisis in the Red Sea region, precipitated by the United States’ military intervention against the Houthis in Yemen. While this conflict appears to have minimal direct impact on U.S. interests, especially when measured against the broader context of the Gaza-Israel war following the October 7 attacks, Washington has elected to intervene unilaterally. This decision has been made without securing the explicit endorsement of critical regional stakeholders such as Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, or even China, all of whom possess a vested interest in the security of one of the world’s most vital maritime trade routes.
[1]
Africa, despite its geographical proximity, remains peripheral to this critical conversation, as its influence over the outcome is negligible.
The second conflict, of a distinctly economic nature, pertains to the ongoing and intensifying trade war between the United States, China, and a host of other economic powers. What began as a series of punitive tariffs imposed by the U.S. on China, Mexico, and Canada has since spiraled into an all-encompassing trade confrontation that includes major global economies, including the European Union. The imposition of tariffs on China, initiated on February 1, 2025, at a modest 10%, quickly escalated to 20% after reciprocal measures by China.
[2]
By mid-April, tariffs had surged to unprecedented levels, with the U.S. imposing a staggering 145% tariff on Chinese imports, which amounted to $438.95 billion in 2024, and China retaliating with a 125% tariff on $143.55 billion worth of U.S. goods.
[3]
These moves were followed by the U.S.’s imposition of tariffs on all nations other than China, further deepening the divide.
The ramifications of this trade war are nothing short of seismic, as it has catalyzed a realignment of the global economic order. According to the International Monetary Fund’s 2024 Economic Outlook, the U.S., the EU, and China collectively represent the lion’s share of the global economy, with respective GDPs of $30.3 trillion, $20.29 trillion, and $19.53 trillion.
[4]
Their trade war is not merely a bilateral dispute between two nations, but rather an economic confrontation that could destabilize the broader global economic system, with profound implications for all economies, including those of Africa.
The U.S. Trade Representatives’ Foreign Trade Barrier Report, released on March 1, 2025, provides a detailed examination of the principal sources of contention. The report highlights China’s protectionist policies, which have systematically impeded U.S. companies’ access to key sectors of the Chinese market, while also emphasizing the European Union’s regulatory approach, which, according to the U.S., has created significant obstacles for American businesses. The EU’s deforestation regulation, if fully implemented, could impose an additional $8 billion annually in compliance costs for U.S. companies, further exacerbating trade frictions.
For Africa, the question remains: where does the continent find itself within the broader context of this evolving global economic landscape? What are the potential consequences for African economies amidst this turbulence, and how can they effectively navigate the volatile currents of international trade to capitalize on emerging opportunities? As the world’s major economic powers engage in a struggle for dominance, Africa’s role, though often overlooked, is crucial and warrants careful examination. Several potential scenarios merit attention as Africa contemplates its position in this complex and shifting global order.
The first possibility is that the U.S., EU, and China remain locked in a prolonged trade conflict. The 90-day tariff suspension announced on April 11, 2025, offers a fleeting window for negotiations between the U.S. and the EU, as well as other key players such as Japan and South Korea. However, the prospects for a comprehensive deal are fraught with complexity. The U.S. has raised serious concerns about its trade deficit with the EU, and there are growing frustrations with the regulatory environment in Europe, which U.S. officials argue hinders American firms’ competitiveness. The EU, for its part, is confronted with internal divisions regarding the most effective strategy to confront U.S. tariffs. Whether the EU can maintain a unified front or whether individual member states will strike separate deals with the U.S. will be a key determinant of the future trajectory of this trade war.
Should the EU manage to maintain its cohesion, it could emerge as a formidable counterweight to both the U.S. and China, positioning itself as a third pole in the global economic order. However, this dynamic carries significant implications for Africa. While the competition among the U.S., EU, and China might drive increased investment flows to the continent as these powers vie for influence, the reality is that Africa risks being relegated to the status of a peripheral player in the broader geopolitical struggle. Africa’s role in this new world order may be determined more by external competition than by internal agency, as the continent’s vast economic potential remains untapped, subject to the whims of foreign powers.
The second scenario is one where the U.S. and the EU forge a strategic alliance in opposition to China. This could emerge if the EU yields to U.S. demands in trade negotiations or if the U.S. prioritizes its transatlantic relationship over its economic engagements with Asia. In this case, the world could witness the emergence of a new “economic Cold War,” with the U.S. and EU aligning against China. For Africa, this would present a highly disadvantageous situation. A deepening U.S.-EU economic bloc would likely exclude the continent from the economic considerations of both powers. Their trade and investment relations would become more insular, focused on deepening transatlantic ties at the expense of African markets. Furthermore, the combined economic weight of the U.S. and the EU could pressure African countries to curtail or sever their economic relationships with China, further marginalizing Africa in the global trade network.
The third, and perhaps most concerning, scenario is the emergence of the U.S. as the sole dominant economic power. Should the EU and China fail to reconcile their differences and respond cohesively to U.S. demands, the U.S. could leverage its economic strength to secure a commanding position on the global stage. This would signal a dramatic shift in the balance of power, with far-reaching consequences for Africa. The continent’s reliance on both the EU and China as key trading partners would place it in a vulnerable position, particularly if both of these economic giants experience stagnation or decline in the face of U.S. dominance. The result would likely be a reduction in African trade and investment flows, further exacerbating the continent’s economic marginalization.
In each of these scenarios, Africa faces an existential challenge. The ongoing trade war between the U.S., EU, and China is one in which the continent has little direct influence, given the limited size and power of its economies. Unlike during the Cold War, when Africa could occasionally leverage its strategic position to secure economic and political gains, the current trade conflict is predominantly an economic struggle, offering little opportunity for Africa to claim neutrality or capitalize on external tensions.
The implications of this trade war are not only economic but also political. Africa’s exclusion from the heart of this global contest highlights the continent’s ongoing marginalization in the international arena. The absence of meaningful African participation in global trade governance underscores a stark reality: Africa’s future cannot be shaped solely by external forces. Rather, the key to Africa’s future lies in its own hands, within its own borders.
Thus, the most prudent course of action for Africa is to invest in its own economic development. Intra-continental trade must become the focal point of Africa’s strategy moving forward. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) presents a unique opportunity to foster regional integration, dismantle internal trade barriers, and create a single, unified market capable of competing on the global stage. In parallel, African nations must focus on developing business-friendly policies, improving infrastructure, and diversifying their economies to reduce reliance on external powers. By nurturing its own economic capabilities, Africa can begin to carve out a more assertive role in the global economic order, shifting from a position of dependency to one of leadership.
In conclusion, Africa’s future does not need to be defined by the trade wars of external powers. While it currently faces marginalization in the context of the ongoing geopolitical and economic disputes between the U.S., EU, and China, the continent has both the potential and the agency to redefine its place in the global system. Africa’s path to economic prosperity lies not in relying on the shifting fortunes of foreign powers but in its own ability to innovate, integrate, and lead. By leveraging its vast resources, talent, and growing markets, Africa has the opportunity to emerge as a dominant force on the world stage. The time to act decisively is now, Africa must seize control of its economic destiny and become the architect of its own future.

TITLE: Navigating Autonomy: Ethiopia’s Quest for Naval Power in the Red Sea   – IFA

1 Conceptualizing Ethiopia’s Strategic Autonomy in the Red Sea
Ethiopia ‘s conception of strategic autonomy in the Red Sea Region is clearly and boldly indicated in Prime Minister Abiy’s recent parliamentary speech in 2025. He stated, “
Raising the question of access to the sea is no longer a taboo … Nor could Ethiopia remain in geographic prison…
.” Of course, the Prime Minister reminded the presence of the generic version of this notion and the need to reorient Ethiopia’s strategy to the Red Sea Region in his book entitled
“
Medemer
”
.  He also underlined Ethiopia’s pursuit of direct access to the Sea is not a tactical engagement which has happened by accident; rather it has been strategically designed to overcome the labyrinth geopolitical challenges in the Red Sea Region. This reflects Ethiopia’s transition from a strategy of adaptable survival in the Red Sea region to, at the very least, a form of ideational autonomy—allowing it to question existing maritime arrangements and negotiate for mutual benefits in the Red Sea governance. This can be evidenced by three important subsequent developments. Firstly, the agenda of accessing to the sea which has been a taboo for the last three decades in the hitherto regime is now a public agenda following the 2018 political transition in Ethiopia. Accordingly, exchanges of ideas and knowledge production on Ethiopia’s access to the sea among the public, scholars and politicians have become day to day activities. Secondly, Ethiopian government through its foreign diplomatic engagement has started negotiation with littoral states and other non-regional actors on how to get access to the sea. Thirdly, Ethiopia has reestablished naval institution under the ministry of defense. In this regard, Ethiopia’s naval diplomacy and port agreements in 2024, rebuilding naval capabilities and active involvement in multilateral organizations are indicators of transition from strategic survival towards autonomy
Diplomatic Pathways to Access to Naval power
2.1 Securitization of the Red Sea: Agenda Framing and Mobilization
Cognizant of the looming threats in the Red Sea region, the Ethiopian government has securitized the region since 2018. In this regard, three key securitization measures have been taken by the government. First, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has delivered a series of speeches in parliament highlighting the strategic importance of the Red Sea, associated threats, and the need for maritime diplomacy to secure access to the sea. Second, the issue has been extensively articulated by key securitizing actors, including the Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Defense. Third, the government has taken extraordinary steps such as engaging in naval port diplomacy and undertaking institutional rebuilding. While Ethiopia has not yet achieved full naval autonomy, it has attained a notable degree of institutional and ideational autonomy. To this effect, Ethiopian government has initiated diplomatic talks with the
neighboring coastal states
such as Djibouti, Somalia, Somaliland, Kenya and Eritrea to negotiate on port access for both commercial and military purposes. Below are some of the diplomatic efforts that underscore Ethiopia’s pursuit of naval access in the Red Sea.
2.2   Ethiopia-Somaliland Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
The first Ethiopian diplomatic move to get access to naval power was exclusively linked with the Ethiopia and Somaliland
Memorandum of Understanding
(MoU) signed in Addis Ababa on January 1, 2024. Although the full content of the MoU was not disclosed, the publicly communicated
agreement
provides a 20 km (12 miles) coastline access to Ethiopia for both naval and commercial uses over a period of 50 years. However, the agreement makes Ethiopian access conditional upon its political recognition of
Somaliland’s statehood
. Beyond the port fee, Somaliland was promised to have a share from the profitable Ethiopian Air Lines. Ethiopia’s diplomatic leverage as the political center of Africa and the seat of the African Union appears to be one of the key factors that motivated Somaliland to sign the deal. The respect of the colonial boundary outlined in the African Union Charter remains a major challenge for the independence of Somaliland. As a result, approaching Ethiopia has been considered by Somaliland as a pathway for achieving formal independence. Additionally, among others, a scholar such as Farah argues that
Ethiopia’s military strength
and its potential to deter any forceful reunification with Somalia was another driving factor behind Somaliland’s decision to enter into the MoU.
Although Ethiopia’s pursuit of access to a naval base presents considerable challenges, its political leverage as the center of African diplomacy and its status as a military heavyweight in the Horn of Africa could support its efforts to achieve negotiating autonomy for a naval presence. To this effect, soft power diplomacy through maintaining the principle of neutrality on the Somalia politics and by acting as a reliable security partner to both Somalia and Somaliland, Ethiopia can achieve its presence as a naval power in the Red Sea region. In other words, striking a balance between the interests of Somaliland and Somalia might thrive Ethiopia to advance its strategic naval autonomy in the Red Sea.
2.3 The Ankara Declaration
The Ankara declaration is the upshot of the Ethio-Somaliland MoU. The way the MoU was signed and communicated caused frustration on the neighboring Somalia. The
government of Somalia
denounced the MoU as a “clear violation of Somalia’s sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity”. It also unequivocally declared the MoU ‘null and void’ and expressed its readiness to defend its sovereignty. Additionally, the Somali government went so far as to threaten the expulsion of Ethiopian troops from the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and to ban Ethiopia’s participation in the new African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM). Furthermore, the government of Somalia requested diplomatic support from regional countries like Egypt, Eritrea and Türkiye. Similarly, regional organizations like the African Union (AU), Arab League and
Organization of Islamic Cooperation
(OIC) offered solidarity to Somalia. Both statements from Ethiopian rival states and regional organizations stressed the need to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia, and its implication for regional peace and security.
The mounting tension between Ethiopia and Somalia as a result of the MoU was averted by the Ankara declaration. The agreement signed on December 11, 2024, at Ankara through the mediation of Türkiye. Based on the Ankara declaration, Ethiopia recognized the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Somalia while Somalia acknowledges Ethiopia’s interest to get access to the sea through lease and contract under the Sovereignty of the Federal Government of Somalia. Both Ethiopia and Somalia agreed on the continuation of Türkiye as mediator for the implementation of the accord. Overall, the Ankara Declaration achieved a delicate balance between Somalia’s territorial integrity and Ethiopia’s access to the sea. It ensured a win-win outcome, giving the sea access agenda broader international recognition and greater significance than the previous MoU. Therefore, it is plausible to argue that Ethiopia demonstrated remarkable ideational autonomy—from setting regional agenda to securing Türkiye as the guarantor for the implementation of the agreement.
3 Rebuilding Institutional Capability
For the last three decades, the EPRDF government suppressed the agenda of access to the sea, as it was widely held responsible for Ethiopia’s landlocked status. However, this simmering public concern re-emerged during the 2005 political contest, in which the opposition—particularly the Coalition for Unity and Democracy—openly supported the issue. The EPRDF government dismissed this stance as warmongering. After the election, the issue of sea access remained an undercurrent in Ethiopian politics. Following the 2018 political transition, the agenda once again resurfaced in public discourse. Currently, the Ethiopian government is leveraging the issue of sea access as a strategic tool in regional geopolitics, with broader ideational influence. Ethiopia now appears to be setting the agenda of access to the sea, rather than merely responding to it. Regional actors are increasingly reacting to Ethiopia’s initiatives, as evidenced by the responses to the Ethio–Somaliland port deal and the Ankara Declaration of 2024. This marks a shift in Ethiopia’s foreign policy—from a subservient geopolitical posture centered on strategic survival to one characterized by
ideational autonomy
.
Among other factors, the growing number of military bases in the Red Sea region, the expanding economy and human population, the increasing competition and influence of Gulf countries in the Horn region, the rise of maritime terrorism in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, Ethiopia’s heavy dependence on the region for foreign trade, and its exclusion from the Red Sea Council were key drivers behind the securitization of the Red Sea and the subsequent establishment of the Ethiopian Navy under the Ministry of Defense in 2019. The Navy was initially launched with a
single commander
and gradually expanded with the recruitment of additional military personnel. It began with a simple structure, consisting of one head and two deputies overseeing logistics and training. Currently, the navy has started practical operations in protecting the Great Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and involved in rescue operations in times of flooding at different parts of the country.
To enhance the institutional and human capacity of the Navy, the government has begun constructing the Navy’s headquarters in Addis Ababa. Currently, the Navy operates within the Ground Forces headquarters. The completion of the new building complex is expected to significantly strengthen the institutional capacity of the Ethiopian Navy. To address the shortage of skilled personnel, the government has also established a naval academy for Ethiopian cadets. In addition, many Navy personnel have received short- and long-term training in various countries with which Ethiopia has established defense partnerships.
4.4 Multilateral Engagement
as Autonomy Multiplier
In line with the decision of the 46th Ordinary Session of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the Committee of Ambassadors from IGAD established the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Task Force (RGATF) on April 4, 2019. The primary objective behind the establishment of the Task Force was to develop a common position and strategy to address the growing challenges and opportunities in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region. Notably, the Red Sea Council (RSC) had been established a year earlier, with membership limited exclusively to littoral states of the Red Sea. As a result, countries such as Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Sudan were excluded. IGAD member states that bordering the Red Sea was granted dual membership on both platforms. IGAD’s Task Force has twenty-one members, three representatives from each member states including Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and Uganda. The task force convened on a quarterly basis and co-chaired by
IGAD
’s special envoy for the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Task force, Ambassador Mohamed Ali Guyo. Ethiopia was prosing and pushing for the establishment of RGATF–the ideational power –at least for three strategic reasons. First, to counter its exclusion from the RSC, Red Sea littorality was the sole criterion for membership. Second, to mobilize non-littoral IGAD members as a counter-bloc in shaping Red Sea security governance. And third, to address the emerging geopolitical dynamics in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region, particularly in light of the increasing frequency and scale of
RSC military drills
.
4. Conclusion
Ethiopia’s pursuit of naval power signifies a fundamental shift from reactive survival to proactive strategic autonomy, moving sea access towards the center of its national security agenda. Through the reconstruction of its navy and high-level diplomacy—exemplified by the evolution from the controversial Somaliland MoU to the more balanced Ankara Declaration—Ethiopia has successfully secured “negotiating autonomy” within the Red Sea region. To ensure this ambition and long-term stability, Ethiopia should now prioritize two key actions: securing maritime access through legally binding international frameworks to mitigate regional sensitivities, and launching confidence-building measures with neighboring coastal states. By integrating joint maritime security and port co-management into its strategy, Ethiopia can transform its naval aspirations into a framework for cooperative regional governance.

Ethiopia continues to assert its pivotal role in advancing African trade integration through the African Continental Free Trade Area (#AfCFTA). A key session on AfCFTA Implementation and Readiness took place at Kuriftu Resort, Bishoftu, bringing together regional and international experts to discuss strategies for deepening continental trade and economic cooperation.
𝐇.𝐄. 𝐌𝐫. 𝐓𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐬 𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐮𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐚, Head of International and Regional Trade Integration at Motri, provided a comprehensive overview linking AfCFTA’s foundation to the 1963 vision of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), emphasizing its focus on decolonization, African unity, and regional economic integration. He highlighted the Abuja Treaty as a cornerstone roadmap toward establishing a continental economic community.
H.E. Mr. Tages underscored AfCFTA’s transformative objectives: creating a single African market for goods and services, eliminating tariff and non-tariff barriers, and promoting the free movement of capital and people. He also stressed the agreement’s role in driving industrialization, economic diversification, and shared prosperity across the continent.
Ethiopia’s strategic position as a founding member was highlighted, with emphasis on its market size, growing economy, and pursuit of equitable access to the Red Sea, crucial for trade efficiency, economic sovereignty, and regional stability.
The session brought together ambassadors and diplomats from Ghana, Kenya, Algeria, and Morocco, reflecting Africa’s strong commitment to collaboration and shared prosperity. H.E. Ambassador General Bacha Debele and H.E. Ambassador Legesse . joined virtually, offering valuable insights on Ethiopia’s diplomatic engagement and its proactive role in advancing AfCFTA objectives through economic diplomacy. This diverse representation not only underscored Ethiopia’s influence in continental trade but also highlighted the importance of shared dialogue and partnership in achieving Africa-wide economic integration. The discussions emphasized that economic diplomacy and strategic coordination among member states are essential to fully realize AfCFTA’s potential.
H.E Mr. Mulugeta Getu, Lead Researcher at the FDRE Policy Studies Institute (PSI), highlighted the background and objectives of the AfCFTA, explaining that Africa, though a vast market, remains fragmented. The Agreement aims to create a single African market uniting 1.5 billion people across 55 countries with a combined GDP of 3.4 trillion USD, promoting transparency, accountability, and good governance in trade while potentially increasing intra-African trade by 45%.
He noted that Ethiopia identified priority export sectors through stakeholder consultations, focusing on business and service industries. To enhance trade readiness and awareness, the Ethiopian Mission has organized forums and workshops with the diaspora, investors, and partners, promoting the national trade agenda and strengthening the competitiveness of Ethiopian products in the continental market.
Speaking from Accra, H.E. Mr. Million Habtamu, Coordinator of Implementation at the AfCFTA Secretariat, elaborated on coordination and legal frameworks necessary for effective AfCFTA implementation. He highlighted key objectives, including deepening continental integration, promoting industrialization and participation in value chains, reducing intra-African trade costs and barriers, and strengthening regulatory frameworks to support industrial growth.
These measures collectively aim to enhance Ethiopia’s regulatory, operational, and productive capacities, positioning the country as a hub for trade intelligence, local industry promotion, and continental economic transformation. By championing AfCFTA objectives, Ethiopia continues to demonstrate leadership in advancing African trade, industrialization, and sustainable economic development.

TITLE: Ethiopia’s Strategic Survival: Economic Drivers for Sea Access – IFA

Ethiopia’s departure from the Red Sea in 1993 and the new maritime status—being a landlocked country, has caused significant impacts on its economy in the horn and the Red Sea Region. As some writers argue Ethiopia has been trapped in “geographic prison” for decades with little hope of regaining direct access to the sea. Owing to the landlocked status, Ethiopia became dependent on the ports of neighboring countries for its foreign trade and strategic relations. Consequently, its regional influence diminished, undermining its ability to pursue an assertive foreign policy (Dagnew & Megento, 2024; Mohammed, 2024). This shift marked a transition from strategic autonomy to survival. A country that once had direct access to the sea suddenly became landlocked after three decades of civil war. This development exposed Ethiopia to economic vulnerabilities. Below are some of the economic showcase discussions on how Ethiopia has securitized access to the sea.
1. Context: Ethiopia’s Transition to Landlocked Status
Ethiopia, which had direct access to the sea and used the ports of Massawa and Assab before 1993, became dependent on the ports of newly independent Eritrea. Due to the initially friendly relations between the leaders of the two countries, Ethiopia was allowed to use the Port of Assab for its foreign trade, enjoying a 75% exemption from port fees during the first five years. However, following the outbreak of the Ethio-Eritrean war (1998–2000), Ethiopia lost access to Eritrean ports. Among others asymmetrical trade relations between the two countries (more favored Eritrea) and the demonetization of Ethiopian currency were the main causes for the eventual outbreak of the War. As it was evidenced by Amare and Mohammed (2023), the war was more of economic than anything else:
Although independent nations are expected to trade with hard currencies, Eritrea used the advantage of the currency union to use birr to purchase Ethiopian commodities, includ ing coffee, and export for USD. This negatively affected the Ethiopian trade balance with Eritrea and inevitably produced political repercussions. This means that Ethiopia, as a sov ereign state, did not benefit from the Eritrean trade as there was no monetary value in terms of hard currency…. Although not the immediate cause, the sudden shift in currency eventually led the two countries into full-scale war in the year that followed.
2. Economic Drivers behind the Securitization of Sea Access
2.1   Costs of being land-locked
According to some studies, landlocked countries incur twice the trade costs of their littoral neighbors. Moreover, the economic growth of landlocked countries is, on average, 6% lower than that of their coastal counterparts. Additionally, landlocked countries like Ethiopia have a low Human Development Index (HDI), extreme poverty index and lower Per capita Gross Domestic Product (PCGDP). At the worst cases, least developed landlocked countries have low economic growth as they are dependent on raw material exports, low volume of export products and low competitive trade because of high logistic cost (Begashaw, 2013).  If we compare the HDI for example, Ethiopia’s
HDI(0.497)
is significantly lower than
Kenya’s(0.602)
which aligns with the preposition that landlocked status is lower human development.
2.2 Dependence on Djibouti and Rising Costs
Since the outbreak of the Ethio-Eritrean War in 1998, Ethiopia has conducted 95% of its foreign trade through the Port of Djibouti. Although Port Sudan and Lamu (Kenya) are occasionally used, the Port of Djibouti remains the most viable option for Ethiopia’s external trade due to its proximity to the country’s center and the presence of the Ethio-Djibouti railway line. However, scholars argue that the lack of diversified port access has negative implications for Ethiopia’s economic development. Djibouti has generated substantial revenue from port services, which account for 80% of its total national income. The volume of Ethiopian foreign trade cargo increased to
9.5 million tons in 2025
. To accommodate Ethiopia’s growing demand for port services, the Government of Djibouti offered the Port of Doraleh for Ethiopia’s exclusive use. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that the cost of port services will continue to rise as Ethiopia deepens its reliance on Djibouti’s port infrastructure (Erico, 2023; Begashaw, 2013). According to various sources, Ethiopia pays between $1.5 and $2 billion annually in port fees to Djibouti—nearly one-third of its estimated 2025 export revenue of $5.3 billion (Terefe, 2025).The cost comparison is best expressed by the recent speech of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed “
the amount of money spent on these charges could be used to build the Renaissance Dam every three years.
”  This dependency undermines Ethiopia’s competitive export capacity due to high logistics costs. For example, Ethiopian agricultural exports to the Middle East are more expensive than those from Sudan and other coastal
African countries.
2
.3 Logistical and Infrastructural Challenges
Djibouti’s reluctance to develop port infrastructures like improving connectivity to and from the railway terminal and the under capacity of the Horizon Oil Terminal to address the growing oil need of Ethiopia threatened the economic security of the country. Beyond this, Djibouti’s insufficient commitment to develop or maintain roads on its side risked the timely arrival of Ethiopian export and import commodities to the port. Furthermore, Ethiopia’s liberalization attempt around Ethiopian Logistic draws tension between Ethiopia and Djiboutian. One of the driving factors for this tension was Ethiopia’s government attempt to privatize the logistics sector owing to inefficiency and monopolistic practices of Ethiopian Shipping and Logistic Service Enterprise (ESLSE). This reform seems to have dissatisfied Djiboutian authorities who had been comfortable with ESLSE for many decades. Unless this grievance cannot be addressed, it poses threats to Ethiopian logistics operators in Djibouti (Terefe, 2025).
Conclusion and recommendation
Ethiopia’s transition from a littoral to a landlocked state witnessed a fundamental shift from strategic autonomy to survival. This has left the country to economic vulnerability, structural dependency and national security risk. Ethiopia’s dependency on the neighboring ports, particularly on Djibouti has caused substantial economic loss—costing $1.5-$ 2 billion port fees and logistics, consuming nearly one-third of its export earnings. Ethiopia’s structural dependency on the port of Djibouti exposed the country to rising costs and undermines its export competitiveness.  To the extreme, Ethiopia’s dependency on a single port might cause security risks like port shutdown that could disrupt commercial and strategic imports. This policy brief recommends that Ethiopia’s long-term economic stability and strategic survival requires moving beyond dependence by achieving secure, diversified, and affordable maritime access.

Ethiopia and China sign an MOU to establish a Working Group to boost investment and economic cooperation
Published:
Feb. 21, 2023
During the Joint Economic and Trade Commission meeting held on February 21, 2023, Ethiopia and China signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to establish an investment and economic cooperation working group aimed at jointly boosting bilateral economic and trade relations in strategic fields.
The MOU was co-signed by H.E. Ahmed Shide, Ethiopia’s Minister of Finance, representing the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and H.E. Li Fei, Assistant Minister of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China, on behalf of China’s Government.
Speaking at the signing ceremony H.E. Ahmed Shide highlighted the two countries’ long-standing relationship of more than half a century and indicated China’s significant role in Ethiopia’s economy as its top trade and investment partner. The Minister added that Chinese enterprises have significantly invested in Ethiopia in diverse sectors, including industrial parks, processing, manufacturing, construction and so forth.
Mr Li Fei on his side expressed China’s commitment to encouraging Chinese enterprises to increase imports of Ethiopia’s competitive products. He indicated that China’s new preferential policy for zero-tariff treatment on 98% of taxable items that Ethiopia will enjoy from 1st March, will lead to tangible benefits from the two countries’ strengthened economic ties.
The two sides discussed common goals of boosting growth, trade, and investment, and indicated that the new Working Group under the signed MoU will help both nations to accomplish their commitment to efficiently implement the development strategies of the “Nine Programs” of the eighth Ministerial Conference of Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) and the Belt and Road initiative.

TITLE: The Blue-Green Deal, introduced by Dr. Gashaw Ayferam and Dr. Gizachew Asrat. – IFA

The Blue-Green Deal, introduced by Dr. Gashaw Ayferam and Dr. Gizachew Asrat, offers a visionary blueprint for Northeast Africa’s future. This initiative harnesses the potential of freshwater and seawater resources, especially with the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (#GERD) and access to the #RedSea.
Ethiopia can transform historical tensions into cooperation through its rivers and strategic waterways. By focusing on sustainable development in hydropower, fisheries, and maritime trade, the Blue-Green Deal aims to foster peace and prosperity in a resource-rich, yet conflict-prone, region.
This framework highlights interdependence, promoting collaboration between landlocked Ethiopia and its coastal neighbors.

TITLE: From Suez Canal to Bab al-Mandab Strait: Navigating Maritime Security in the World’s Busiest Maritime Trade Corridor – IFA

The article “From Suez Canal to Bab al-Mandab Strait: Navigating Maritime Security in the World’s Busiest Maritime Trade Corridor” by Abebe Yirga and Gashaw Ayferam examines the growing maritime insecurities and geopolitical rivalries affecting one of the world’s most vital trade corridors.
Using a sustainable maritime security framework, the authors argue that the Red Sea region—from the Suez Canal to the Bab al-Mandab Strait—has become a contested space for military presence and power projection among global and regional actors.
The article contends that post-pandemic maritime insecurity has worsened due to military buildups, port competition, piracy, terrorism, and Houthi attacks. These interrelated threats span political, economic, environmental, and social sectors, each reinforcing the other.
Politically and economically, the authors note that rival maritime strategies, infrastructural vulnerabilities, and vessel attacks have disrupted global trade, raised shipping costs, and destabilized supply chains.
Environmentally and socially, the study highlights pollution from oil spills, human and arms trafficking, and seafarer casualties as major security challenges. Such issues, the article argues, exacerbate climate risks and feed back into political and economic instability.
The authors conclude that achieving sustainable maritime security requires enhanced cooperation among littoral states, stronger regional institutions, and diplomatic efforts to resolve broader conflicts—particularly the Israel-Gaza and Iran-Israel crises—whose spillover effects threaten Red Sea stability.

In his keynote speech at ACS2, Prime Minister Abiy stated, “Too often, African stories at climate summits begin with what we lack—lack of finance, lack of technology, and lack of time. But we’re the youngest population in the world, endowed with creativity and innovation. We have the fastest-growing solar capacity on earth, vast arable land, and abundant resources that can feed the continent, including green technologies from wind, solar, and geothermal energy.” “We are not here to negotiate our survival; we’re here to design the world’s next climate economy,” he added. “If we make the right choices now, Africa can be the first continent to industrialize without destroying its ecosystems,” he emphasized. “In Ethiopia, we have seen what is possible when determination is driven by clear purpose.” This takes shape through deliberate, data-driven actions that address our challenges and opportunities. “Guided by purpose, we are implementing initiatives that show the power of vision and community effort,” he continued. “In 2019, we launched the Green Legacy initiative. In seven years, we have planted over 48 billion seedlings. They cool our land, enrich our soil, restore watersheds, provide food, create jobs, and boost exports,” he concluded.

The Institute of Foreign Affairs (IFA) hosted an online meeting on March 19, 2025, to discuss Ethiopia’s preparations for the upcoming 2nd BRICS Dialogue, scheduled for April 4, 2025. The session, chaired by H.E. Jafar Bedru, Executive Director of IFA, brought together key stakeholders to assess Ethiopia’s strategic direction within BRICS and explore opportunities for deeper engagement.
A key focus of the meeting was Ethiopia’s growing partnership with BRICS nations, as part of its broader effort to strengthen economic ties, attract investment, and enhance its role in global governance. Dr. Haminot Eshetu presented insights on the BTTC Document Enrichment and key takeaways from last year’s BRICS Dialogue, highlighting Ethiopia’s progress in economic and diplomatic engagement within the bloc.
In concluding the session, H.E. Jafar Bedru outlined several strategic initiatives to reinforce Ethiopia’s role in BRICS.

As Ethiopia prepares for the 2nd BRICS Dialogue, these initiatives reflect its commitment to strengthening ties within BRICS and expanding its global influence. With Brazil set to assume the BRICS presidency in 2025, Ethiopia aims to capitalize on this momentum to deepen its economic and political participation.

Hon. Dr. Tesfaye Bejigu and H.E. Jafar Bedru engaged with young diplomats in a dynamic training session, fostering insightful discussions on diplomacy, the philosophy of Medemer, and the challenges ahead. A thought-provoking exchange shaping the future of Ethiopia’s diplomacy.
H.E. Jafar Bedru delivered a profound lecture on the philosophy of Medemer at the Pre-Service Diplomatic Training Program, Civil Service University. At its core, Medemer is a philosophy of synthesis—uniting Ethiopia’s diverse society by focusing on commonalities rather than divisions.
It serves as both a diagnosis and a remedy for the fragmentation within the state, addressing governance challenges and legitimacy crises.
Medemer promotes the reintegration of political, economic, and social structures—offering a systematic approach to nation-building.
By fostering unity in diversity, Medemer envisions an Ethiopia strengthened by collaboration, shared history, and collective aspirations.
This philosophy is more than an idea; it’s a blueprint for sustainable governance and inclusive progress.

President of Uzbekistan puts forward initiatives for expanding multifaceted cooperation with China
17.06.2025
On June 17 President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev took part in the second “Central Asia – China” summit in the city of Astana.
An event chaired by the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, was also attended by the President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping, President of the Kyrgyz Republic Sadyr Japarov, President of the Republic of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon and President of Turkmenistan Serdar Berdimuhamedov.
According to the agenda prospects of expanding mutually beneficial cooperation between the countries of Central Asia and China in priority areas, topical international and regional issues were reviewed.
In the beginning of his speech President of Uzbekistan particularly noted the role of the President of China Xi Jinping in strengthening friendship and cooperation with Central Asian states, supporting sustainable development of the region through implementing concrete projects and programs.
The major progress in interaction in the “Central Asia – China” format after the first summit in the city of Xi'an in 2023 was noted with satisfaction.
Particularly, a secretariat was established, effective meeting mechanisms of ministers and experts are in force, regulatory base of full-scale cooperation is being formed.
Trade turnover of Central Asian states with China is growing, which will reach $100 billion this year according to estimations.
-
In our view, the development of cooperation in this format is facilitated, on the one hand, by the processes of profound transformation in Central Asia itself, which has turned into a space of trust, good-neighborliness and partnership. On the other hand, it is the unwavering commitment of the Chinese leadership to the development of friendly relations with neighboring states and the promotion of the global concept of the “Belt and Road”
, - said the Head of our state.
Afterwards the Leader of Uzbekistan presented his vision of further development of regional cooperation.
Firstly, it was mentioned that the current meeting is being held in the conditions of worsening of the international situation.
The increasing competition leads to escalation of tensions, arising of new challenges and obstacles to security and sustainable development.
-
We consider unjustified and inadmissible the use of forceful methods to resolve controversial international issues and conflict problems,
- emphasized the President. -
I am convinced that all disputes and disagreements should be resolved exclusively through diplomatic efforts - at the negotiating table, on the basis of the principle of respect for sovereignty, norms of international law and the Charter of the United Nations
.
In this regard it’s been pointed to the historical significance of adopting in the course of the summit a Treaty on eternal good neighborliness, friendship and cooperation, which will become a joint contribution to ensuring regional stability. To develop this Treaty it was proposed to work out a Concept of long-term partnership with specific mechanisms and projects.
As mentioned the Head of our state, trade, investment and technological partnership with China is a major locomotive in implementing strategies of socio-economic development of all Central Asian countries.
It was highlighted that convergence of the increasing potential of the region’s countries and the industrial leadership of China will enable the establishment of Common space of huge opportunities with effective mechanisms of knowledge exchange and technology transfer.
The soonest adoption of the Program of new economic partnership and establishing an Interregional council for trade and investments at the level of deputy Prime ministers could become practical steps in this direction. Readiness of the Uzbek side was expressed to hold the first meeting of the Council by the end of the current year.
In order to stimulate trade ties President of Uzbekistan advocated for organizing a multilateral trade platform “Electronic Silk road” in the framework of “Digital Belt and Road”.
The demand for creating a Regional center of industrial standardization and certification in Tashkent for interfacing standards and frameworks, certification of export products by Chinese requirements, was mentioned.
It was proposed to adopt a separate “road map” for technology transfer, involving business, leading research institutes and engineering centers.
The Leader of Uzbekistan separately noted the necessity to intensify industrial and infrastructure interconnectedness to effectively utilize economic potential. In this regard, it was proposed to develop a long-term strategy “Industrial and infrastructure belt “Central Asia – China”.
It involves creation of a system of interconnected industrial clusters, techno-parks and logistic hubs with attraction of Chinese investments, technological and scientific solutions.
The issues of interfacing the energy systems of Central Asian countries and China, including the implementation of the megaproject for the construction of a high-voltage power transmission line, also require careful study.
The issue of introducing effective financial instruments capable of supporting major projects of regional significance is of particular relevance.
-
The current international mechanisms undoubtedly play an important role, but they do not fully cover the region's investment needs. According to experts, the deficit of capital investments in the infrastructural development of Central Asia amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars
, - said the Uzbek leader.
In this respect, it was proposed to consider the possibility of establishing the “Central Asia-China” Development Fund, which could become an effective platform for promoting infrastructure initiatives.
The development of transport interconnectivity between Central Asia and China has been identified as another priority.
It was noted that the launch of construction of the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railroad is an important element of the new system of transport and transit communications in the Eurasian space. At the same time, the implementation of the Trans-Afghan railway project will open up even wider opportunities.
-
In the interest of developing a common vision of prospects in this strategic area, I believe it is necessary to instruct our transport agencies to form expert groups to conduct field studies, explore opportunities for modernizing logistics infrastructure and implement pilot projects of cargo transportation along alternative corridors
, - suggested the Leader of Uzbekistan.
Based on the results of the work of these groups, specific and substantiated proposals for the formation of a unified map of transport corridors and modern transit infrastructure should be developed by the next summit.
Pointing to the serious challenges of climate change for sustainable development, the Head of our state urged to accelerate the adoption of the Green Development Program until 2030, as well as establish the Ecological Alliance for dialogue and partnership in combating desertification, restoring degraded lands, enhancing bio-ecological sustainability in arid and desert zones.
-
I would like to emphasize the opportunities for cooperation in the field of artificial intelligence and digital technologies. It is these areas that today act as drivers of long-term growth, determining the competitiveness of national economies
, - said the President of our country.
In order to form a sustainable digital infrastructure of economic interaction it was proposed to create a Network of mutually integrated big data banks and processing centers, as well as construct a Digital track of fiber optic connection line "Central Asia – China” along the main energy and transport routes.
-
Our invaluable asset is the mutual commitment to enrichment of cultures and bringing our people together. It is for these means that the Mutual Travel Facilitation Initiative and the Cultural and Humanitarian Action Program, currently under way, are directed
, - mentioned the President.
To further strengthen cooperation in this area, it was proposed to create a single digital portal “Cultural Heritage of the Silk Road”, uniting historical and cultural resources of Central Asian countries and China, with its access to researchers, students, tourists and representatives of the creative industry.
The relevance of forming a common scientific and educational platform through the development of a program of cooperation in the field of professional education, holding forums of university rectors, meetings of heads of academies of sciences and research centers, was also pointed.
Cooperation in the field of security remains among the key priorities. In this regard, the President advocated the establishment of multilateral mechanisms for the exchange of information through special services and security councils in the fight against terrorism, extremism, radicalism, drug trafficking, illegal migration and cybercrime.
-
The decline in the international community's attention to the problems of Afghanistan, which for us is not just a neighbor, but an integral part of the common historical, cultural and economic space, is of serious concern
, - said the Uzbek leader.
Noting the rich experience of interaction between China and Central Asian states with Afghanistan, the President of Uzbekistan proposed to establish within the current format a High-level group to consider issues of assistance to the reconstruction and involvement of this country in regional integration processes.
The readiness was affirmed to hold its meeting in the city of Termez with participation of Afghanistan’s representatives.
Concluding the speech it was underlined that Uzbekistan is committed to an open dialogue, expanding pragmatic and mutually beneficial cooperation in the “Central Asia – China” format.
As a result of the summit, the heads of state signed Astana declaration and a Treaty on eternal good neighborliness, friendship and cooperation.
A solid package of intergovernmental and interagency documents was also adopted.
In the end of the summit, a ceremony of launching centers for combating poverty, diversification, interaction in the field of education, as well as cooperation platforms for uninterrupted trade, took place.

The leader of Uzbekistan supported the resumption of the work of the “SCO-Afghanistan” Contact group, one of whose main tasks could be to develop proposals for the development of constructive dialogue and support for socio-economic projects in Afghanistan.
Against the backdrop of current trends in the global economy, priority is given to expanding trade and economic cooperation.

President of Uzbekistan Calls for International Unity in 'Green' Silk Road
18.10.2023
President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev attended the opening ceremony of the Third Belt and Road International Forum and its plenary session on the topic of "Joint Construction of the 'Green' Silk Road for the Harmonious Coexistence of Humanity and Nature" on October 18 in Beijing.
The Summit, moderated by Vice President of the People's Republic of China Han Zheng, was also attended by the Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres, heads of state and government and leaders of financial institutions.
In his speech, the Head of our state sincerely congratulated all the participants of the event on the tenth anniversary of the "Belt and Road" Initiative.
It is noted that over a short period, this grand idea of reviving the Great Silk Road has gained numerous supporters, becoming a new model of international cooperation. Uzbekistan, as a comprehensive strategic partner of China, was among the first to support the "Belt and Road" Initiative. Uzbekistan has expressed a firm commitment to further advancing its main goals and objectives.
The President of our country emphasized that the "Green" Silk Road Initiative essentially shapes the agenda for a common "green" future. Uzbekistan fully supports this initiative, which was first proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in our country in 2016.
Pointing out the complex ecological situation in the region, manifested by abnormal weather conditions, droughts, dust storms, land degradation, desertification, and loss of biodiversity, the Head of our state stated that Central Asia is becoming one of the most vulnerable regions to the consequences of climate change.
It is noted that Uzbekistan is implementing a comprehensive program to establish an Ecological Innovation and Technology Zone in the Aral Sea region within the framework of the adopted special resolution of the United Nations General Assembly.
In this context, a high assessment is given to the outcomes of the Climate Change Summit held in September of this year, initiated by the United Nations Secretary-General. The Summit addressed ambitious climate-related tasks.
To facilitate the exchange of views and unite efforts in achieving the goals of "green" development in Central Asia, the President of Uzbekistan has put forward the initiative to hold the Samarkand International Climate Forum in 2024.
"We hope that this Forum will be a practical step towards creating the 'Samarkand Dialogue for the Sake of the Future' to find answers to the global threats of sustainable development," stated the President of our country.
There is an expressed interest in developing broad international cooperation within the framework of the "Green" Silk Road. In this regard, the Leader of Uzbekistan shared his vision for further deepening partnerships with China and other participants of the "Belt and Road" Initiative.
As part of the alignment of conceptual initiatives -- the "Green Agenda of Central Asia" and the "Green Silk Road", it has been proposed to develop a comprehensive "green" development program. This program would include measures and projects for the "green" transformation and digitalization of economic sectors, the creation of sustainable infrastructure in the transportation and energy sectors, the establishment of "green" industrial capacities, poverty reduction, and the development of smart agriculture.
Another important task in the construction of the "Green" Silk Road is the development of "green" production chains and innovations. There is a readiness expressed to create a Special Demonstration Technopark in the Aral Sea region jointly with leading Chinese companies and other international partners. This Techno Park aims to promote industrial and socially significant programs based on the widespread adoption of "green" technologies.
The Head of our state has proposed the establishment of the "Green Financing Fund" in Uzbekistan to support the development of a low-carbon economy and "clean" technologies, as well as the implementation of high environmental standards in the region.
The Leader of Uzbekistan has also called for the reduction of restrictions and barriers in mutual trade of "green" goods, especially agricultural products. Additionally, it has been proposed to intensify the dialogue on transitioning to "green" energy and to hold regular meetings of ministers from the countries participating in the "Belt and Road" initiative.
The President of Uzbekistan has put forward the initiative to create a scientific and information platform for the transfer of "green" knowledge and solutions based on the International Innovation Center of the Aral Sea region.
Given the growing shortage of skilled professionals in the field of "green" development and ecology, the Leader of our country has advocated for the development of a Program for Training Specialists and the enhancement of academic exchanges in the field of "green" development and ecology. This program would be based at the Central Asian University for Environmental Studies and Climate Change, in collaboration with leading foreign universities and educational centers.
Furthermore, the Head of our state emphasized the importance of responsible stewardship of natural resources and the environment. It has been proposed to launch a Global Program for the Development of "Green" Culture within the "Belt and Road" initiative. This program would involve organizing ethno-ecological festivals, forums, presentations, and other events featuring prominent public figures, scientists, business leaders, and cultural representatives.
In conclusion, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev expressed confidence that the fruitful results of the Forum would make a significant contribution to the collective effort of building a "green" future for humanity.

Address by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to the participants of the ceremony dedicated to the launch of the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railroad construction project
27.12.2024
Distinguished participants of the event!
I sincerely welcome you at the inauguration ceremony of construction of the new China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway.
The first-ever full-fledged Agreement on the implementation of this strategic trans-regional project was signed six months ago. The preparation of technical documentation has been completed in a short span of time. And today, we are launching relevant construction works.
This is a truly historic event, which marks the 30 years-long journey of our friendly countries.
A new transportation artery of international significance is being formed.
It will connect the Central Asian region with China through the shortest overland route and further expand multifaceted cooperation and strengthen the strategic partnership among our countries.
The project is also perfectly aligned with the goals of the Belt and Road Initiative, today uniting many countries of the world for the benefit of common sustainable development and prosperity.
In this regard, I would like to once again express my gratitude to my esteemed colleagues – Mr. Xi Jinping, the President of the People's Republic of China, and Mr. Sadyr Japarov, the President of the Kyrgyz Republic, for their personal contribution and active efforts in promoting the project.
Dear participants of the ceremony!
I would like to underscore the great impact that the construction of the new railway will have on the economies of our countries and our vast region.
This major infrastructure project envisages extensive cooperation with cutting-edge engineering, innovative and digital solutions, while complying with high environmental standards.
A total of 20 stations, 42 bridges and 25 tunnels will be built along the Kashgar - Torugart - Makmal - Jalal-Abad - Andijan route.
In addition, state-of-the-art transit and logistics infrastructure, as well as warehouses and terminals will be developed.
It is estimated that the commissioning of this road will have a multiplier effect on regional trade and investment, significantly reduce transport costs and unlock the enormous transit potential of Central Asia.
I would like to point out a few more figures.
The annual freight traffic along the corridor will total 15 million tons.
The distance and delivery time of goods from China to European markets will reduce by several thousand kilometers and almost a week.
There will be an opportunity to organize regular passenger traffic services.
In the long run, interlinking of this railway with the Trans-Afghan corridor will effectively connect and strengthen the transport and communication interconnectivity of China, Central and South Asia.
Obviously, all our countries will feel the economic benefits. Hundreds of new enterprises and tens of thousands of jobs will be created.
And, certainly, this project will facilitate the revival of the Great Silk Road, the development of cultural and humanitarian exchanges, and further bringing of our peoples closer together.
Dear friends!
Uzbekistan is committed to active participation in all stages of the construction of the railway, making full use of all available technical and intellectual resources.
I am convinced that with joint efforts this transport corridor will become another symbol of our strong friendship, partnership and progress.
On the eve of the New Year, I wish every success to the engineers, construction workers, and all those involved in the implementation of this strategic project. Today your hands are building the shared future of our countries and our region.
Thank you for your attention.

Summit of China and 17 countries of Central and Eastern Europe
At the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping, the President of the Republic of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić participated today in the video-conference Summit of China and 17 countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
"Distinguished Excellency, President of the People’s Republic of China, Mr. Xi Jinping,
Your Excellencies, representatives of the Central and Eastern European Countries,
Dear Friends,
Exactly two weeks ago, when he was addressing the World Economic Forum, President Xi underlined that “divided world cannot fight common challenges the mankind is facing. Multilateralism is about having international affairs addressed through consultation and the future of the world decided by everyone working together. We must stick to the cooperation concept based on mutual benefit, to safeguard equal rights of development for all countries and to promote competition based on righteousness and justice.  And scientific and technological advances should benefit all humanity rather than be used to curb and contain other countries' development.
On behalf of the citizens of the Republic of Serbia and on my personal behalf, I want to thank our host for his warm welcoming words and for the privilege to address this distinguished gathering.
Honorable President Xi,
I was deeply moved by your invitation. It was on time that you had recognized the need to initiate this forum, and today you insist on a true need for “China and CEEC to intensify communication, to reach consensus and pave the way for future cooperation supporting economic and social recovery and development in post-COVID era.”
I agree with your conclusion that through cooperation mechanisms offered through this format of the dialogue “we will contribute, to great extent, to enrichment of overall cooperation between China and Europe.”
The importance that the People’s Republic of China attaches to this gathering is best reflected in a fact that our host will be a person of big international reputation and the architect of multilateralism- President Xi.
Serbia had to respond reciprocally to such a gesture of respect, and that is why President of the Republic is addressing.
I am very pleased that trade exchange between China and Central and Eastern European Countries increased by 8,4% in 2020, going thus beyond 100 billion dollars.
In overall trade exchange between Serbia and the world in 2020, China was at the third place. In 2020, trade exchange was close to 3.7 billion USD which is 30% growth comparing to 2018. Only in the past 5 years, our export to China increased 15 times.
In 2020 there was a historic maximum of our export to China, and just for the comparison sake, our export to China in 2010 was only 7.3 million, and this year – more than 377 million USD.
By the end of 2020, Chinese direct investment in the Central and Eastern European Countries including energy, infrastructure and logistics were 3.14 billion dollars gross, while investment of the respective countries in China reached 1.72 billion dollars.
I take the liberty of saying that this is about establishing new development paradigm and making global cooperation in fighting coronavirus pandemic easier.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Allow me to briefly inform you on the current economic parameters in the Republic of Serbia, which are the result of implementation of economic measures aimed at mitigating COVID-19 pandemic consequences.
Today, after difficult reforms and despite the pandemic, Serbia notes unprecedented results in its modern history. We are the first in Europe judging by growth rate, and second in terms of number of vaccinated people.
We want to preserve good results and keep improving Serbia.
Immunization in Serbia has started by the vaccine manufactured by the Chinese company Sinopharm, together with the American Pfizer and Russian Sputnik V vaccines. We also expect vaccine deliveries through COVAX and the European Union.
Serbia managed to become a positive example in the entire Europe, thanks to unselfish and fraternal help of the People’s Republic of China and President Xi.
Since life cannot and must not stop, I would like to remind you that Serbia hosted the
Fourth
China-CEEC Ministerial
Conference on Innovation
, whose biggest result was Belgrade Declaration on Cooperation in the Field of Innovation.
Serbia wants to strengthen its position in the region when it comes to development of innovation, intelligence, robotics and digitalization, which we see as a path for creating better, more prosperous and more satisfied society.
Possibility of having our country as a host for the center of the smart cities is of strategic interest for Serbia.
Belt and Road, this magnificent vision of the President Xi is getting clear shape right in front of our eyes. Serbia is on its EU path and at the same time will do its best to strengthen ties with our Chinese friends.
Donated and purchased medical equipment shipped from China reached Serbia through ancient routes of the Silk Road, from Xi’an and Wuhan, through Hungary to Serbia.
Unlike the ancient Silk Road, medication and equipment came to the Balkans with more than 88 flights, and using numerous railway compositions.
Modernization of Belgrade-Budapest railroad will enable even faster transportation of goods towards Greek ports, and better connectivity between China and numerous Asian countries with Europe.
We believe that continuous dialogue on the highest political level is crucial for development of strategic relations between Serbia and China in all areas of economic, culture and medical activities.
I hope that as soon as the epidemiological situation in Serbia enables that, we will have the opportunity to welcome President Xi Jinping again.
I am pleased to conclude that there was almost no impact of the pandemic on working processes, and that numerous Chinese companies in Serbia continued working on realization of the agreed projects, like construction works on highways on Corridors X and XI, as well as on numerous projects in the field of energy.
In the end of January this year, the Memorandum of Understanding for the “Belgrade Metro” project between the Government of the Republic of Serbia, the City of Belgrade and Chinese company “Power China” and French company “Alstom”  that is supposed to start in the third quarter of 2021 was signed.
We expect that cooperation will intensify in the field of sports, agriculture, education, science and technology, where Serbia-China Industrial Park Project in Belgrade is of big importance.
Additionally, Serbia successfully presented its achievements on the Third China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November 2020.
Previous year has displayed all weaknesses of the mankind and forced each country to reexamine its capacities, putting at the same time to serious test many new alliances, but also traditional ties.
Basic postulates we had built on our habits on free flow of people, goods, capital and services were shaken by global introduction of quarantine and actual limitation of the freedom of movement.
Distinguished President Xi, allow me to avail myself of this opportunity to renew to you, on behalf of the citizens of the Republic of Serbia and on my personal behalf, our deepest gratitude for prompt assistance in medical equipment that the Government of the People’s Republic of China made available to my country and my people, and to “Fire Eye” laboratories that China donated to Serbia were of great significance in virus detection.
Only through cooperation between all countries, exchange of experience in the spirit of solidarity and understanding, but also through openness and identifying new cooperation modalities, a global recovery will be possible.
Dear Friends,
According to the traditional Chinese lunar calendar, New Year begins in three days. The year ahead will be in the sign of Buffalo. According to the ancient belief, the Year of Buffalo is a year when many of us will reach new knowledge and decisions. More importantly, the upcoming period will be good for all those who are used to hard work.
Finally, I would like to remind you of a far-reaching speech of the President Xi, as of May 15th 2017. On that occasion, my friend draws accurate parallels between the Silk Road and “Belt and Road” Initiative. The development of the Belt and Road is rooted in history, but orients to the future. The ancient Silk Road embodied the pursuit of a better life of our ancestors, promoted the interconnection of countries in Asia and Europe, pushed forward the exchanges and mutual learning of civilizations between the East and the West, and made great contributions to the development and progress of human civilization. We can fully draw wisdom and strength from the ancient Silk Road, promote cooperation in the spirit of peaceful cooperation, openness and tolerance, mutual learning, mutual benefit and win-win, and open up a brighter future together.
Long live friendship between Serbia and China!", said President Vučić in his address.

President Vučić attends the arrival of the first cargo train from China to Serbia
President of the Republic of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić and Vice Minister of Trade of the People's Republic of China Qian Keming attended today the arrival of the first cargo train from China to Serbia. The cargo train of the Chinese company "China Railway Express", with over 500 tons of equipment for the construction of the fast railway through Serbia, arrived at the New Belgrade railway station.

President Vučić said that it will take 30 minutes by train from Belgrade to Novi Sad if the works are completed within the stipulated deadline.
He added that the fast railway to Subotica will be finished by 2022 and that he will talk to the Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orbán so that the works get expedited on their side as well.
President Vučić emphasised that it will take merely 2.4 hours to get from Belgrade to Budapest which implies that it will take four and a half hours to Vienna which is far better than to commute by plane considering the time spent at the airports.
„That will be a perfect connection with Europe", said President Vučić and added that Serbia is not a stop-by station for the Chinese trains anymore, but rather a destination.
"These are the important days for us because for nearly 40 years almost nobody was using trains in passenger and cargo transportation. I think we will manage to return railway transportation through a wide gate back to our country. I am grateful to our Chinese friends for working with great attention to this project through which we confirm that we can change ourselves. Please, convey the most sincere greetings of the people of Serbia to the President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping. Long live the steel friendship of Serbia and China", said President Vučić.

President Vučić added that the Chinese train departed from China on the 24th September and that it traversed the 10.500 kilometres long way bringing the state-of-the-art equipment for the fast railway in Serbia which meets and exceeds all the European standards and holds all the certificates for the fast railways.
He thanked the Chinese railways for connecting Belgrade and Budapest by a fast railway because thus we will be well connected to Central and Western Europe.
"In this way, we also show what it is that we can do", said President Vučić and added that Belgrade is now the city of construction cranes and that the capital, as well as the entire country, keeps developing rapidly.
President Vučić also said that back in 1837 Duke Miloš suggested the construction of a railway through Serbia towards Austria-Hungary, but that even then Serbs had the unbelievable talent to resist any progress. Thus the first 12 kilometres long narrow-gauge railway was constructed by a foreigner in 1880 who was the manager of the Majdanpek mine and only some time later the first railway Belgrade-Niš was commissioned in 1884.
He also said that in 2011 the train from Belgrade to Novi Sad was slower than 100 years ago, which shows how large were the unconcern and negligence of the state at that time.
Photo: TANJUG / Rade Prelić
"My idea was to criss-cross and cover Serbia with all the modern communications, roads, railways, internet, and that thus Serbia joins in the developed economies with solved infrastructural issues", emphasised President Vučić.
President Vučić iterated and underlined that Serbia would not be able to do all that without the help of the President of China Xi Jinping who is the great friend of our country and for which reason the Chinese companies engage in construction works across all parts of Serbia. The President asked the Vice Minister of Trade Qian Keming to convey to President Xi the most sincere greetings from him and from the Serbian people and added that he always speaks sincerely about China within the domains of the world politics.
The Chinese Vice Minister of Trade Qian Keming said that Serbia and China foster the steel friendship and that they jointly face all the challenges, and that today's arrival of the cargo train of the company "China Railway Express" serves as evidence of the long history of friendship that connects the two countries.
"Our two countries rely on each other, they are friends of steel who advance together through all challenges. Serbia is the first country in the Central and Eastern Europe to establish the overall and comprehensive strategic partnership relations with China", said Keming.
Photo: TANJUG / Rade Prelić
He emphasised that the agreements and joint efforts of President Vučić and President Xi prompt the building up of the "Belt and Road" initiative thus giving momentum to the deeper development of cooperation between China and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
"Bilateral trade rapidly increases, results are being achieved in all areas and especially in the area of infrastructure", said Keming.
The Vice Minister of Trade of the People's Republic of China Kemin reminded that at the Second high-level summit within the "Belt and Road" initiative, President Xi said that high quality "Belt and Road" should be jointly built where the accent should be placed on the mutual connection and improvement of infrastructure connections.
"The Belgrade-Budapest railway will be realised within the 'Belt and Road' initiative. This is the first project in the area of railway transportation to be implemented by a Chinese company in Europe. It is very important for regional infrastructural inter-connection", said Keming.
He explained that "China Railway Express" connects all the countries along the Road which at the same time represents the "bridge of friendship" that unites the people of China with the people of all the countries included in the "Belt and Road" initiative.
"This train departed a month ago from the homeland of Confucius - the Shandong province - and today it arrived in Belgrade loaded with the material and equipment for the Belgrade-Budapest railroad. This is a signal to accelerate the section on the Serbian side", said Keming.
The Vice Minister of Trade of the People's Republic of China Qian Keming wished a successful construction of the railway, even better cooperation between China and Serbia in the area of trade, and ended his address with the message: "Long live the friendship of China and Serbia!".

Letter of congratulations to the President of the People's Republic of China
President of the Republic of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić extended his congratulations to the President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, accompanied by the best wishes to the Chinese people with whom we are tied by a steel friendship, to continue with the overall progress following the wise leadership. The congratulation reads as follows:
"Serbia welcomes all the accomplishments that China has achieved since its founding on October 1, 1949. Under the visionary leadership of its leaders, with the strong unity of the Communist Party of China and in spite of the numerous challenges on the internal and international levels, your stunning country has grown into one of the world's most valued partners in the last seven decades, contributing to peace and stability as well as to global development.
Allow me, Excellency, to express my deep admiration for you and other great Chinese leaders, as all the successes of China over the last seven decades have been the result of yours and their thoughtfulness, knowledge, courage and firm belief in the people and their ideals. With its unparalleled development in just 70 years, China has shown to the world how the tenacity, work and commitment of leadership and people can create an economic power from an underdeveloped country, a pioneer in infrastructure endeavours and a leader in the field of innovations, modern technology and space exploration. At the same time, China is one of the best examples of how to defend integrity and state sovereignty in a peaceful and dignified manner and how to resolve historical disputes. I am convinced that with your leadership in the successful implementation of reforms aimed at building socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new age, China will soon fulfil the great Chinese dream to the benefit of the whole world.
I am exceptionally proud of the fact that the relations between our two countries have reached the highest level in history, and that now when I have the honour to be the President of Serbia and thus a unique opportunity to invest efforts together with you to further enrich our overall strategic partnership. I look forward to Serbia being part of the visionary 'Belt and Road' initiative, which through its expansion offers the opportunities for further progress to the whole world as evidenced by the increasing number of countries joining it. Serbia attaches great importance to regional cooperation through the cooperation mechanism of China and Central and Eastern European countries.
We are looking forward to the development of economic cooperation, especially project cooperation in the fields of infrastructure and energy, as well as new Chinese investments in Serbia such as the successful investment in Železara Smederevo and RTB Bor, which, with the opening of new factories, contributes to the overall development of Serbia and the region as a whole.
I avail myself of this opportunity to once again iterate my special gratitude to the People's Republic of China in helping us to preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia, as a matter of fundamental state and national interest. Given its reputation and influence in the world, we highly appreciate China's understanding, especially in the light of recent attempts by so-called Kosovo aimed at illegal membership in international organizations and institutions. At the same time, I would like to reiterate the unwavering and unequivocal support of Serbia to the "one China" policy", said President Vučić in his congratulations, adding that he hopes for President Xi's soon visit to Serbia.

President Vučić visits works on construction of a part of the Belgrade - Budapest high-speed railway
President of the Republic of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić visited earlier today the construction works on the part of the Belgrade-Budapest high-speed railway from Belgrade to Stara Pazova. The railway is being built according to European standards and will be our state-of-the-art railway.

President Vučić said he was satisfied with the dynamics of the works and that it would be essential, in addition to another section en route to Budapest - from Novi Sad to Subotica - to build a high-speed railway from Belgrade to Niš. That section would be designed for speeds of up to 200 kilometres per hour, while the section from Niš to Preševo - for the speed of 160 kilometres per hour. He stated that the topic is already being discussed with Chinese companies and Russian railways, which are building a part of the high-speed railway from Stara Pazova to Novi Sad.
"We are also considering the Belgrade-Niš section, which would mean a lot for passenger traffic from Europe to Serbia, but also our freight." We must not leave out the south of Serbia. Then we would have the entire line of a high-speed railway from Subotica to Novi Sad, Belgrade and Niš", President Vučić said and announced that the works on the railway from Belgrade to Stara Pazova will be completed by the end of the year and that the railway will be commissioned by the end of March the following year.

President Vučić stated that the works on the part of the railway from Stara Pazova to Novi Sad will be completed in August 2021 and that the railway will be opened to traffic in September 2021.
"Then we will hurry up to complete the last section through Serbia, from Novi Sad to Subotica, which could be completed in 2024. The Hungarians will complete their section by the end of 2024 or the beginning of 2025," said President Vučić and pointed out that from March 2025, we will be able to travel by train from Belgrade to Budapest in two hours and 40 minutes, and then from there to Vienna in another hour and 40 minutes.

"It's important for our relations, and it will increase the living standard of citizens and the flow of goods, which is extremely important for our economy. These are the things that we will remain behind us, revolutionary things that you do not believe in until you see them. Thank you to our Chinese partners for their hard work, efforts and engagement. Thank you to Serbian and Chinese workers for their arduous work", said President Vučić and emphasised that in Serbia, in addition to the railway, four highways are currently under construction.

President Vucic meets the Vice-President of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Bin
President of the Republic of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić met earlier today the Vice-President of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Bin, whose visit - as pointed out during the talks - represents yet another confirmation that the "steel friendship" and overall strategic partnership of the two countries are growing stronger in all areas.
The Chinese official conveyed to President Vučić the greetings of President Xi and said that China particularly appreciates the immense contribution of President Vučić to the development of bilateral relations and the sincere support to the "Belt and Road" initiative, the cooperation mechanism "17 Plus 1", and the inter-party cooperation. She congratulated President Vučić for the good economic results Serbia keeps accomplishing.
President Vučić reciprocated the greetings to President Xi and reiterated on this occasion the firm support to the principles of the "Belt and Road" initiative, and emphasised that it has already brought much happiness to the Serbian people through participation of the Chinese companies in implementation of the most important infrastructure projects as well as through the significant Chinese investments. „It is one of the greatest and most productive initiatives in history. The respect China confers to all countries and their right to development and independent decision-making irrespective of their size - deserves the support of all who believe in the ideals of true equality and solidarity", said President Vučić.
President Vučić said that the visit of the Vice-President Li is particularly important considering that the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the highest advisory body of the State Council of the People's Republic of China and that the suggestions rendered by this body are of vital importance for formulation of the national strategy. The President added he was convinced that the bilateral relations between Serbia and China will continue to develop through intensive political dialogue and diverse economic cooperation.
The two interlocutors have reviewed the possibilities of cooperation in various areas and in particular in the area of tourism considering the ever-increasing number of Chinese tourists in the world. As the number of Chinese tourists in Serbia marks a fivefold growth, they expressed the expectations that a direct flight may be established between Belgrade and Beijing.
The today meeting was also an opportunity to reiterate the mutual support in the issues of crucial interest for the two countries in accordance with the international law. President Vučić expressed his gratitude for the principled and resolute standpoint of China regarding the respect of territorial integrity and sovereignty of Serbia and affirming again the unwavering support of Serbia to the "One China" policy. With that respect, he said that the current situation in Hong Kong represents the internal issue of China and he remains convinced that President Xi and the thoughtful leadership of China are capable to resolve the issue in a righteous manner.

At the opening of the Surčin-Obrenovac section, President Vučić said that all citizens of Serbia should be content with this day because in the coming decades they will be proud of having taken part in the construction of the most important roads for Serbia.
"(The citizens should be proud of taking part) in the endeavours that bring future in the economic and every other aspect, in what will revive Central and Western Serbia, in the efforts that will bring new value and a new quality of life", said President Vučić.
He said that Belgrade and Čačak awakened today and decided to start walking towards each other, to become closer, thus making all the places along that road and that part of Serbia members of one big close family.
"Only yesterday, Čačak and Belgrade were two and a half hours away, and today - only an hour. Anyone who travels will save one hour of time, and thanks to that will be able to spend more time with family or at work. Today, the Serbian people have become richer in more time, more jobs and more factories," said President Vučić.

He emphasised that this is the best gift to Serbia after many years of anguish, transition, devastated factories.
I cannot recover to you, the citizens, the time we lost for the roads in the past all due to negligence, indolence, inertness... But today we can make sure that you get more time so that we all mind the future together," said President Vučić.
Visiting the new highway and the magnificent bridge near Obrenovac over the Sava and Kolubara rivers, President Vučić talked with the representatives of the Chinese company
CCCC
also engaged in the construction of the section from Preljina to Požega, where he was promised by the company Director Zhang Xjaoyun that the road will be completed by the end of 2021.
President Vučić said that in precisely two years, citizens will be taking the highway from Belgrade to Požega and that they will no longer have troubles in driving through the Ovčar-Kablar Gorge.

He also said that the development plan will be presented on the 28th December that will not be only the list of nice wishes.
"That will be a plan with a very strong reform agenda appertaining the growth of 6 and more per cent until the year 2025. We seek to take the top position in Europe in the economic growth rate," stressed the President.
Ambassador of China to Serbia, Chen Bo, said today that the opening of the Surčin-Obrenovac section represents a huge event in the development of Serbia as well as in the cooperation development between China and Serbia. She also wished for the steel friendship of the two countries to progress even further in the coming years.
"We, the Chinese, say that construction of roads is the first step towards wealth," said Chen at the ceremonial opening of the "Miloš the Great" highway section.

She added that she feels pleased when seeing that Serbia has achieved great results in the field of infrastructure in recent years, and especially because the Chinese companies gave their contribution to it.
Ambassador Chen pointed out that the cooperation in the area of infrastructure remains to be an important part of relations between Serbia and China as well as a significant chapter of the "Road and Belt" initiative.
She added that the commissioned sections of the "Miloš the Great" highway were constructed by Chinese companies also engaged in other projects such as the construction of the Belgrade bypass, hi-speed railway Belgrade-Budapest and construction of the Preljina-Požega section.
"Nothing is far away anymore," said Ambassador Chen.

As the Surčin-Obrenovac section is the first major project in the last few years to be completed before the deadline, Chen thanked for the trust put in the Chinese companies and the Chinese workers who showed the quality and efficiency to Serbia and the whole of Europe.
Ambassador Chen wished everyone a happy family saint day, Saint Nicholas, as well as the New Year, wishing that the steel friendship between Serbia and China will continue to advance in the coming year.
The 17.6 kilometres section of the "Miloš the Great" highway that was opened today, completes the Belgrade-Čačak highway in the length of 120 kilometres. By the completion of this part of the "Miloš the Great" highway, it will be possible to travel from Belgrade to Čačak in about one hour.
The new highway has a total of 12 bridge structures, with spans ranging from 11 to 1,581 meters, as well as two large loops - Surčin and Obrenovac.

TITLE: Ethiopia’s Diplomatic Transition during António Guterres’s UN Tenure (2017–2025): From Security Posture to Regional Convening – IFA

Introduction
Since 2018, Ethiopia’s diplomacy has shifted from an inward, regime-security logic to an outward strategy emphasising regional cooperation, economic interdependence and human security. This transition occurred alongside reforms advanced by UN Secretary-General António Guterres—particularly preventive diplomacy, development system reform, and modernisation linked to
Our Common Agenda
(United Nations, 2021). Ethiopia drew on this multilateral moment to reposition itself as a key convener in the Horn of Africa, while also using peacekeeping and climate diplomacy to sustain international standing (Kefale, 2022; United Nations Peacekeeping, 2025).
Major milestones include the 2018 Ethiopia–Eritrea peace initiative and Ethiopia’s expanding engagement in South–South and multipolar groupings, culminating in BRICS accession in 2024 (Fisher and Gebrewold, 2019; BRICS Secretariat, 2024). However, these gains remain vulnerable to renewed regional tensions and domestic political pressure. This brief recommends measures to consolidate Ethiopia’s regional integration agenda, protect peace dividends, and deepen cooperation with UN reform instruments—especially the Resident Coordinator system and anticipatory governance initiatives (United Nations, 2019; UNDESA, 2023).
2. Background and Problem Statement
Before 2018, Ethiopia’s foreign policy largely followed an “outside-in” model: external engagement was shaped mainly by internal security priorities, ethnic fragmentation concerns, and regime stabilisation needs (Clapham, 2018; Tadesse, 2020). This posture constrained Ethiopia’s ability to invest consistently in regional institution-building and often narrowed international engagement to counter-insurgency, border deterrence, and security bargaining.
In parallel, multilateral systems faced persistent limits—fragmented development assistance, storage tower of humanitarian response, and slow conflict-prevention action. Guterres’s agenda sought a more integrated UN presence at country level, linking prevention, development and peace in operational practice (United Nations, 2017; United Nations, 2019). Ethiopia’s policy challenge became how to convert UN reform priorities into deliverable national and regional outcomes while managing continuing pressures in the Horn of Africa.
3. Analysis and Key Findings
3.1 Regional Integration and the “Horn First” Shift
During the Prosperity Party period, Ethiopia advanced a “Horn First” orientation connecting domestic prosperity to the stability of neighbouring states—closer to regionalist liberalism than classical realism (Medhane, 2019). The 2018 rapprochement with Eritrea ended a prolonged “no-war, no-peace” impasse and signalled willingness to incur political costs to pursue reconciliation (Fisher and Gebrewold, 2019). UN emphasis on preventive diplomacy reinforced this direction (United Nations, 2017). Even amid later strains, Ethiopia’s preference for restraint and dialogue reflects a move toward de-escalatory diplomatic tools rather than coercive escalation.
3.2 Alignment with UN Institutional Reform
Ethiopia benefited from UN development reform, particularly the strengthened Resident Coordinator system, which improved coherence across agencies and linked UN support more directly to national priorities (United Nations, 2019). System-wide evaluations report strong host-government perceptions of improved coordination following reform, indicating concrete value for states managing intersecting development and humanitarian pressures (UNDESA, 2023). Ethiopia’s UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (2020–2025) aligned UN programming with the Homegrown Economic Reform agenda and the Ten-Year Development Plan, prioritizing inclusion, resilience and sustainability (UN Ethiopia, 2020).
3.3 Peacekeeping as Diplomatic Capital
Ethiopia remained a leading troop contributor and gained influence through UN deployments, including UNISFA and UNMISS (United Nations Peacekeeping, 2025). The Action for Peacekeeping (A4P) initiative raised expectations for performance and accountability, and UN structural adjustments linking political and operational functions strengthened the relationship between field deployments and political strategy (United Nations Peacekeeping, 2018). Ethiopia used peacekeeping as a durable source of credibility even during periods when domestic politics affected its wider soft power.
3.4 Climate Leadership as a Credibility Multiplier
Ethiopia’s Green Legacy Initiative (2019) positioned the country as a prominent African advocate for nature-based solutions and broadly aligned with Guterres’s emphasis on climate as a central global governance issue (United Nations, 2022). Hosting Africa Climate Summit II in 2025 and advancing the Addis Ababa climate declaration strengthened Ethiopia’s role as a platform for continental climate diplomacy (AUC, 2025). Climate initiatives also supported domestic goals, including jobs, land restoration, and adaptation planning. Ethiopia’s Green Legacy Initiative (2019) positioned the country as a prominent African advocate for nature-based solutions and broadly aligned with Guterres’s emphasis on climate as a central global governance issue (United Nations, 2022). Hosting Africa Climate Summit II in 2025 and advancing the Addis Ababa climate declaration strengthened Ethiopia’s role as a platform for continental climate diplomacy (AUC, 2025). This climate leadership was further reflected in Ethiopia’s participation at the 2025 G20 Summit in Johannesburg, where it reinforced Africa’s collective climate priorities within global economic and governance forums. Climate initiatives also supported domestic goals, including jobs, land restoration, and adaptation planning.
4. Conclusion and recommendations
Ethiopia’s external strategy in the Horn of Africa is most credible when it links regional stability to tangible economic gains, stronger multilateral delivery, and measurable resilience outcomes. A practical way to close the gap between ambition and results is to consolidate “Horn First” through institutionalized interdependence. By scaling cross-border infrastructure, energy connectivity, and trade corridors with Sudan, Djibouti, Kenya, and other neighbors, Ethiopia can help build a predictable “community of gains” in which shared revenues, logistics efficiencies, and power pooling raise the cost of conflict and lower incentives for disruption. In this framing, diplomacy becomes a tool for de-risking investment and normalizing cooperation through projects that make everyday welfare depend on stable relations.
At the same time, Ethiopia can convert multilateral engagement into stronger domestic delivery by using UN reform instruments as coordination levers. The Resident Coordinator system and the UN Cooperation Framework offer channels to align development partners around national priorities, reduce duplication, and strengthen planning for drought and food security via anticipatory action, data, and forecasting tools (United Nations, 2019; UNDESA, 2023). If Ethiopia pairs this coordination role with clear targets—such as early response triggers, pre-positioned supplies, and resilience investments in hotspot areas—UN processes can become visible to citizens as well as donors, strengthening legitimacy and results.
Ethiopia’s long-standing peacekeeping role remains an important asset, but it gains more strategic value when paired with expanded prevention diplomacy. Maintaining troop contributions can continue to signal responsibility and provide leverage in multilateral forums; however, a parallel investment in political mediation capacity, early-warning cooperation, and stabilization diplomacy would show that Ethiopia is contributing to conflict prevention, not only crisis response. The aim is to connect security commitments to prevention outcomes that can be tracked: fewer border incidents, stronger dispute-resolution channels, and faster diplomatic de-escalation when shocks occur.
Finally, Ethiopia can strengthen its international standing by converting climate diplomacy into finance and resilience delivery. The Green Legacy Initiative and climate summit outcomes can be connected to bankable pipelines for adaptation and green growth—especially land restoration, biodiversity protection, water security, and resilient infrastructure. By improving project preparation, strengthening monitoring, and positioning programs for climate funds and blended finance, Ethiopia can shift from narrative leadership to resource mobilization that households and regions can experience through reduced climate vulnerability and more stable livelihoods.
Taken together, these four options form a coherent agenda: Ethiopia can anchor “Horn First” in interdependence, improve development results through UN coordination tools, couple peacekeeping with visible prevention diplomacy, and translate climate leadership into financed resilience (United Nations, 2019; UNDESA, 2023). This integrated approach also aligns with Ethiopia’s wider diplomatic posture as reflected in its policy architecture at the 2025 G20 Summit—signaling a move from primarily inward development planning to more proactive global engagement. Grounded in technological modernization and a commitment to green growth, Ethiopia’s diplomacy presents a template for how African economies can pursue influence in global governance while protecting national priorities. By advancing Just Energy Transition, Digital Sovereignty and global institutional reform, Ethiopia positions itself as an active contributor to the rebalancing of economic power and agenda-setting, rather than a peripheral participant.

TITLE: The United Nations at a Critical Juncture: Africa’s Time to Take Active Role – IFA

It was eighty years ago that the United Nations (UN) was established by the founding member states in 1945 to maintain international peace and security, foster friendly relations among the community of nations, and to attain international cooperation. It was the manifestation of determination to “save the succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to humankind.”
[1]
The establishment of the UN was raising hopes for peace and tranquility after five years of devastation that claimed millions of lives. Since then, the UN has gone through ups and downs to meet the spirit of the founding document,
the Charter that serves as the bedrock of a “more peaceful, prosperous, and just world.”
Different challenges that have emerged from the institutional setup, the paucity of transparency and accountability, the lack of commitment of the member states to reform the organization, geopolitical tensions, and major power competitions have caused the UN system to become “bureaucratic, costly, cumbersome, lacking in oversight, and often incapable of fulfilling the responsibilities placed upon it.”
[2]
In response to persistent challenges confronting the organization, various reform initiatives have been proposed. Among these were An Agenda for Peace (1992) [3] and An Agenda for Development (1994)
[4]
, the UN Millennium Declarations, High-Level Panels, and the 2005 UN Summit Outcome Document.
[5]
The foregoing and subsequent reforms aim to capacitate the organization to deal with the present economic and political realities.
At the time of commemorating its eightieth anniversary, the United Nations has faced formidable challenges that could compromise its responsibilities. Cognizant of the multifaceted crisis the UN is currently facing, the current Secretary General of the organization, Antonio Guterres, remarked that “we cannot solve 21st century problems with 20th century tools. We need a UN 2.0”
[6]
at the opening of the UN 2.0 in April 2024. Again, on 22 September 2024 at the Summit of the Future, global leaders adopted the Pact for the Future and its annexes, including the Global Digital Compact and the Declaration on Future Generations.
[7]
The agreement is the testimony of a commitment demonstrated by the member states to address the global challenges humanity is facing and prepare the generation for future challenges. The Pact for the Future addresses the lingering global issues as to peace and security (the Security Council reform, nuclear disarmament, space governance, and regulating emerging technologies); sustainable development and climate action (sustainable development goals, financial reform, climate finance, and rethinking progress); digital cooperation; youth and future generations; transforming global governance; and human rights and gender equality.
[8]
Banking on previous reforms, the UN80 initiative has been launched since March 2025 by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to make the organization “more agile, integrated, and equipped to respond to today’s complex global challenges amid tightening resources.”
[9]
Since 22 September 2025, leaders have attended the UN General Assembly. This meeting has been held amidst the rising of uncertainty, the erosion of multilateralism and the weakening of the collective security system, the rising of unilateralism, deteriorating relations between major powers, crises in the Middle East and in some parts of Africa, challenges accompanying the future of the peacekeeping operations in Africa, poverty, terrorism, pandemics, environmental challenges, migration and refugees, transnational crimes, human rights violations, and humanitarian crises. Furthermore, artificial intelligence and mounting biological risks are increasingly posing threats.
[10]
The multilateral response to the crises is severely affected by the lingering divisions among the members of the Security Council, “a divided international community and a divided membership.”
[11]
In response to the multifaceted crisis the UN is facing, representing 54 states, the African Group (AG) needs to continue to demonstrate a common position and voice together with like-minded states and groups that could address the divisions and the paralysis afflicting the organization, particularly the Security Council during the 80
th
Session of the UN General Assembly that is held under the theme
“Better together: 80 years and more for peace, development, and human rights” since 9 September 2025.
[12]
African states should further advance the historic agreement of the Pact for the Future and its annexes that call for enhanced international cooperation to address climate change, poverty, and health problems.
[13]
In line with the commitments, African states, including Ethiopia are also keeping on championing the reform of the UNSC by calling for the overturning of the historical underrepresentation of Africa , strengthening the Economic and Social Council, strengthening the United Nations System, more investment on regional security infrastructure, reforming the international financial architecture and sustainable financing, nuclear disarmament, preventing arms race in space, maritime security and safety and secure support for the realization of  sustainable development goals. Indeed, the African Union, in this regard, can play a pivotal role by bringing the continent’s voices to the front stage as recently the chairperson of the AU Commission, Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, engaged in demonstrating a commitment to “join Africa’s heads of states and government to highlight Africa’s leadership and agency in addressing peace and security challenges”
[14]
and reach out to global partners to “promote investment and trade opportunities that can accelerate Africa’s development and advance the AU’s Agenda 2063.”

Thus, African states will continue to demonstrate their commitment to the UN’s multilateral framework as “the most viable path to achieving global peace and sustainable development.”
[16]
This will in turn help the goals of the present initiative to have a global institution that is efficient, effective, people-centered, accountable, and proactive in addressing global challenges amidst the shifting international order.

TITLE: Saudi-Pakistan Defense Pact: A New Security Frontier – IFA

Introduction
The September 9, 2025, Israeli attack targeting exiled Hamas leaders in Qatar shocked not only the Arabs but also the whole Muslim world. Countries from super and sub identities gathered in solidarity in Doha, where they condemned the Israeli attack as barbaric and provocative. Arab and Muslim leaders in the conference and in their side talks discussed the next steps to defend countries in the region from any future regional threats. Participants of the summit proposed many alternative measures to tackle future threats, including the formation of a Muslim/Arab NATO style security alliance, banning Israel from the United Nations General Assembly, and cutting diplomatic and economic ties with Israel.
The reverberation of the Doha conference culminated in the historic Saudi-Pakistan Defense Pact, signed on 17 September 2025, a pact typically signed when two friendly nations reach the zenith of their diplomatic relationship. The agreement was signed between Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are the most powerful nations in the Muslim world, Pakistan being the only nuclear nation in the Muslim world, while Saudi Arabia is the ideological and economic hub.
According to the Pakistani Prime Minister,
This agreement, which reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieving security and peace in the region and the world, aims to develop aspects of defense cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression. The agreement states that any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both.
The Prime Minister’s speech indicated that the scope of the pact extends beyond regional commitment, potentially enabling the two countries to engage in broader global peace and security initiatives. The remarks also alluded to the potential exchange of the latest military technologies, such as nuclear warheads and the latest fighter jets. Most significantly, the Prime Minister unequivocally underscored that any attack on Saudi Arabia is considered an attack on Pakistan, and vice versa.
Saudi officials, meanwhile, dismissed the unfounded narrative linking the pact to regional events or adversaries. This is best captured in the saying of one Saudi official: “
This agreement is a culmination of years of discussions. This is not a response to specific countries or specific events but an institutionalization of longstanding and deep cooperation between our two countries
.” However, scholars and analysts have already begun to debate the scope, limitations, and implications of the Saudi-Iran Defense Pact. As this backdrop, this policy brief will examine the context, commitments, and potential scenarios of the pact vis-à-vis Ethiopia’s strategic interest in Saudi Arabia.
Strategic Context
The Saudi-Pakistani relations began right after the independence of the latter from British colonialism in 1947. The relation is characterized by consistency with a high level of trust from both sides. This is due to the fact that Pakistan believed in Saudi Arabia’s de facto leadership of Islam and portrayed itself as the guardian of Saudi Arabia. The level of trust can be evidenced by the presence of Pakistani soldiers (1500-2000) stationed in Saudi Arabia for decades as protectors of the kingdom, advisor, and trainer of the Saudi Armed forces. So far, Pakistan has reported having trained over 8000 Saudi military personnel. Beyond these, the kingdom frequently summoned additional Pakistani military forces whenever Saudi Arabia was threatened by external threats. The Al-Wadiah War between Saudi Arabia and Yemen in 1969, and the deployment of 20,000 Pakistani Soldiers in Saudi Arabia during the Iraq-Iran War in the 1970s and 1980s were cases in point. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia has also been a major importer of Pakistani arms, purchasing $81 million worth in 2016 alone. Although the relations between the two states at the strategic level have been harmonious, Pakistan’s rejection of contributing troops to the Saudi-led intervention against Houthiss remained exceptional (Rabia, 2025; Anwar et al, 2025).
Theoretical Framework: Understanding the Saudi-Pakistan Defense Pact
The Saudi Pakistani Defense pact seems to be best explained by alliance theory. Two distinct theories are very important to explain this Pact. The first is
balance of threat theory
which was developed by Walt (1987) while the second one was
alliance dependency theory
which was developed by Snyder (1997).
The
balance of threat theory
contends that states primarily form alliance for balancing threat but it is determined by the level of threat perception. Walt identified four sources of threat: aggregate power of a rival state (population, economy and military capability), geographical proximity (neighboring states are more threatening than distant states), offensive capability of a rival state (power projection and advanced weapon) and perceived intentions of a rival state (aggressiveness and hostility). All these determinants changes the behavior of states on why and how to form alliance. Most states form alliance against the strongest threat to protect themselves while others align with a threatening power.  Alliance are flexible depending on the threat perception. This is to mean that credibility of alliance rests on shared threat perception—alliance strengthened if perception converges (Walt, 1987).
The alliance dependency theory, on the other hand, argues that alliance is formed for mutual dependency, but this dependency is often asymmetrical. This determines the bargaining power, influence, and durability of the alliance. The state that is less dependent on the alliance will have more bargaining power. This imbalance creates opportunities for exploitation in which the stronger power urges more concessions, while the weaker power fears abandonment. States manage alliance dependency paradox through assuring credibility, adjusting commitments, and striking a balance between autonomy and alliance cohesion (Snyder, 1997).
The Pact: Cause and Commitments
Causes of the Alliance
Although the triggering factor for the signing of the Defense pact between Saudi and Pakistan is Israeli aggression of Qatar on 9 September 2025, the balance threat theory seems to explain why the alliance is formed. On the side of Saudi Arabia, the geographical proximity of the Houthis, Iran’s growing regional influence, and the United States’ failure to provide a reliable security guarantee were the main driving factors behind the alliance (Rabia, 2025). The Houthis has been the most formidable threat for Saudi Arabia, the geographical proximity of the threat just in its immediate neighborhood seem to have forced Saudi Arabia to form alliance with a nuclear state of Pakistan. The level of the threat can be evidenced by the 2018 Houthis rocket and drone attack on the Saudi cities and oil infrastructures. It should be noted that Saudi Arabia fought bloodiest war with Houthis between the years 2014 and 2023. Although peace agreement was signed in 2023, Houthis and Iran are still the primary security concern in comparison to Israel. The alliance with nuclear-armed Pakistan enhances Saudi Arabia’s deterrence posture. It signals that aggression from the Houthis—or indirectly from Iran—will be met with a strengthened security guarantee. The pact therefore serves both as an immediate hedge against local threats and a broader balancing mechanism against Iran’s regional influence (Al-Madhaji, 2016). The Saudi-Pakistan defense pact reflects a strategic choice to balance threats rather than merely respond to crises. By deepening its alliance with Pakistan, Saudi Arabia seeks to deter hostile actors like Houthis, Iran and Israel hoping an aggregate outcome of greater regional stability.
On the other hand, Pakistan is the closest non-Arab ally to Saudi Arabia. Although Pakistan is the only nuclear state in the Muslim world, it is the most politically unstable and economically impoverished state. Since 1949 Pakistan has been struck by military coups, no civil government completed five year of terms. The military regularly intervened in the civilian politics notably using military coup, judicial rulings and presidential decrees. For example, the military directly took over power three times in 1958, 1977 and 1999.  Economically, Pakistan frequently suffered from chronic inflation, currency depreciation, low productivity and export. In addressing these, the country is highly dependent on foreign loans and financial support especially from Saudi Arabia and IMF. Saudi Arabia is the main economic backer when Pakistan faced macroeconomic instability. The kingdom often supported Pakistan in terms of grants, loans and provision of oil in credits. For instance, it is worth mentioning Saudi’s $ 6 billion financial support to stabilize the Pakistani financial crisis in 2018(Ibid). It is fair to conclude that Pakistan signed the Defense Pact primarily driven by economic aspirations particularly aiming at increasing the cash inflow and steady oil supply from Saudi Arabia.
Commitments of the Pact
When countries signed a defense pact, there are certain
commitments
that need to be observed. However, commitments differ depending on the scope and depth of the agreement. Saudi and Pakistan signed a historical defense pact on 17 September 2025. According to the statement of the agreement, both countries pledged a “joint deterrence against aggression”.  Although the details of commitment is not clear whether it  will follow a NATO style Article-5 framework or not, it is crystal clear that both countries declare that any attack on Saudi is an attack on Pakistan, and the vice versa. Although Pakistan involved in training and advising the Saudi Armed forces for decades, formalizing strategic cooperation in terms of Defense Pact potentially enhance all military assistance including the provision of a “nuclear umbrella” to the kingdom (Rabia, 2025). Beyond these, joint military exercise, sharing of intelligence and defense technology, supply and sales of weaponry are some of the commitments which are expected from both nations, particularly from Pakistan.
Since the two powers have asymmetrical independence in their commitment, their relation will be more of symbiotic. Saudi Arabia is economically the most prosperous nation in the Muslim world while Pakistan is among the poorest. Riyadh is expected to provide financial support in terms of loans, grants, credit facilities. Saudi Arabia is also expected to expand its oil supply on preferential terms. Beyond these, the kingdom is anticipated to invest in Pakistani military industrial complex particularly in “Project Azem”, a research and development program aimed at building a fifth-generation stealth fighter air craft. Saudi Arabia’s strong economic and financial leverage increases Pakistan’s dependence on Saudi Arabia. On the contrary, Pakistan holds the most powerful military, and the only nuclear state in the Muslim world. This provides a more bargaining power for Pakistan to influence the new Defense Pact, while Saudi Arabia remains dependent on Pakistani military capability. Given Ethiopia’s strategic interest (remittance, hundreds thousands of immigrant workers, Red Sea security and energy security) rests more in the stability of Saudi Arabia, the next section will assess scenarios whether the pact will provide effective protection to the latter.
Scenarios: Will the Pact Defend Saudi Arabia?
The Saudi–Pakistan Defense Pact could provide Saudi Arabia with enhanced security, but the extent of its effectiveness depends on how both sides operationalize their commitments. Given the long-standing diplomatic relations between the two states, three possible scenarios can be developed whether the pact will effectively defend Saudi Arabia.
Scenario 1: Partial or Symbolic Defense
The pact will most likely have partial or symbolic defense for the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. There are many reasons for this scenario to happen. Firstly, the ambiguity of terms in the agreement, whether it could provide a NATO-style Article 5 guarantee for Saudi Arabia. Secondly, Saudi Arabia’s dependency syndrome on the US security protection. It is unlikely for the Saudi leaders to break the security alliance with the US. Although there were a few cases of security impasse, the kingdom has not been totally detached from the US security enclave for the last many decades. The signing of the pact with Pakistan seems an act of Saudi Arabia’s tactical move to bring the US back to its traditional service. Thirdly, Saudi Arabia’s complete withdrawal from the US Middle East security architecture might expose the kingdom to strategic vulnerability. In response to the pact, the US might shift its alliance with the traditional enemies of the kingdom, such as Iran, the Houthis, and Israel. Beyond this, the US might undermine the role of Pakistan in Saudi Arabia through economic sanctions and a strategic alliance with its traditional enemy, India. Lastly, Pakistan’s technological incapability to sufficiently deter threats to Saudi Arabia. How far is Pakistan potentially capable of defending against Houthi, Iranian, or Israeli missiles, drones, and aerial attacks? These are some of the puzzles that need to be addressed in relation to the effectiveness of the defense pact. In such a case, the pact would act more as a political signal of solidarity than a binding operational defense arrangement. While Saudi Arabia would gain some reassurance, its hard security would continue to depend on U.S. military systems and Western partnerships.
Scenario 2: Effective Defense of Saudi Arabia
The pact will likely serve as an effective Defense mechanism for Saudi Arabia. There are some reasons for this to happen. Firstly, the pact most importantly might provide a “nuclear umbrella” to Saudi Arabia, which is a powerful deterrence for the threats coming from the region and beyond. Secondly, excessive petro-dollar inflow from the kingdom will keep Pakistan committed and stable. Lastly, Pakistan is anticipated to provide more military manpower and advanced training to the Saudi armed forces. All these provisions could reduce dependency on the US for hard power and boost protection of vital infrastructure such as oil fields, ports, cities, and borders.
Scenario 3: Ineffective Defense of Saudi Arabia
The pact will unlikely provide meaningful defense for Saudi Arabia. Some of the reasons for this scenario to occur are: Firstly, the entrenched political instability between civilian politics and the military might undermine Pakistan’s capability to project power abroad. Secondly, the incompatible threat perception might hamper cooperation between the two signatories. Saudi Arabia might prioritize Iran (a neighbor to Pakistan), Houthis, and Israel, while Pakistan might prioritize India. Thirdly, Pakistan might hesitate to intervene militarily in times of real crisis if Iran/Houthis attack or an Israeli strike occurs. All these factors might have led the kingdom to abandon the pact and be forced to fall back on the US security arrangement.
Conclusion
Saudi Arabia and Pakistan signed the defense pact, aiming at balancing threats. The former joined the pact primarily threatened by Iran, the Houthis, the expansionist policy of Israel, and the US failure to provide a security guarantee.  The latter was primarily motivated to ensure economic and political stability through securing economic assistance from Saudi Arabia. Although many writers portrayed Saudi Arabia’s confrontation with the Houthis and Pakistan’s Indian-centric nuclear doctrine as potential challenges, the two nations are supposed to set balancing mechanisms to align their national interests. The defense pact seems to have shown that there is asymmetrical commitment in which Pakistan, with higher bargaining power, is entrusted to provide military assistance such as advisory, training, arms supply, including the provision of “nuclear umbrella”, while Saudi Arabia with strong economic commitment is anticipated to provide loans, grants, credit facilities and investment for Pakistani military industrial complex. However, the presence of mutual dependency between the two nations strengthens the durability of the defense pact, as it reduces the risk of entrapment and abandonment. Given that Ethiopia’s strategic interest rests more in the stability of Saudi Arabia, the effective protection of the latter either through this defense pact or the US security arrangement will ensure the uninterrupted flow of remittance, communal security of hundreds of thousands of Ethiopian immigrant workers, stability of the Red sea region, and safeguard energy security.

TITLE: The Seventh Africa-EU Summit: Priorities and Divergences? – IFA

Summary
The seventh summit between the two sides of the Mediterranean Sea will set priorities to strengthen future relations, learning from the past.  The possibility of cooperation anchored in mutual benefits, common values, and shared interests could benefit the two continents as long as they move toward actionable solutions. Nevertheless, the drifting away from supporting the African Solutions to African Problems, domestic security uncertainties in the continent, some African states’ turned their back on their European counterparts in the aftermath of military coup, demonstrated piecemeal move to reform the existing international institutions, the war between Moscow and Kyiv, and the emerging alternative economic and security arrangement seem to cloud the coming summit and hence remain the significant sources of divergences between the African Union and the European Union in the future relationship.
The Previous Summits
Africa has built bilateral and trilateral partnerships with major global actors. As part of addressing both continental and global challenges, the African Union, representing its member states, has been forging ties with its counterpart, the European Union, for the last twenty-five years. Since 2000, the AU-EU summit has been held in the selected capital cities of member states of the African Union and the European Union. Since the start of the partnership, the areas of cooperation between the two sides have focused on peace and security, migration, democracy, good governance and human rights, trade, health, development, multilateralism, global and emerging issues. The first meeting between the two sides of the Mediterranean Sea took place in Cairo, Egypt, on 3 and 4 April 2000 under the theme of ‘A New Dimension to Our Global Partnership for the Twenty-First Century’.
[1]
After a seven-year interval, the second summit was held in Lisbon, Portugal, in 2007 that culminated in the adoption of the Africa-EU Joint Strategy and its Action Plan
[2]
and the establishment of an institutional setup and funding mechanisms to support AU’s activities.
The third and fourth summits were held in Tripoli on November 29 and 30, 2010, and Brussels, Belgium, on 2 and 3 April 2014, respectively. During the Tripoli Summit, the Tripoli Declaration and a Joint Declaration on Climate Change were adopted.
[3]
The roadmap for EU-Africa relations (2014-2017) was adopted during the Brussels Summit.
[4]
In Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, the fifth AU-EU Summit was held on 29-30 November 2017. The Abidjan summit gave due recognition to the UN’s 2030 Agenda on sustainable development, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and Africa’s Agenda 2063.
[5]
The sixth EU-AU Summit took place in Brussels on 17 and 18 February 2022. During this summit, the leaders of both institutions agreed on a joint vision for a renewed partnership.
[6]
The Joint AU-EU Vision for 2030, among others, aims to augment AU peace support operations, support for the UN assessed contributions, support for the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security (WPS), Youth, Peace and Security and deepen cooperation on security. Luanda’s summit, scheduled for 24 and 25 November 2025, will be more than a symbolic celebration of the 25th anniversary of their cooperation. It will set the priorities and demonstrate the divergent positions both sides have vis-à-vis regional and global issues.
The Seventh AU-EU Summit: Priorities and Dark Clouds
The seventh summit between the two sides marks a quarter-century partnership between the EU and the AU.
[7]
The coming summit will give due attention to regional economic integration, trade, peace and security, climate financing, AI, the erosion of multilateralism, the Global Gateway Initiative, and the unfolding conflict between Russia and Ukraine. On the side of Africa, Agenda 2063, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), Sustainable Global Development 2030, reforming the global financial and security architectures, particularly the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the United Nations Security Council, and financing the peacekeeping operations (UNSC 2719) will seize the center stage.
Both the AU and the EU share common priorities, albeit with concern about the prevailing misalignment evident in the two-decades-plus partnership. Indeed, both sides are also showing a commitment to shared values and to maintaining multilateral arrangements amid the unfolding challenges. Despite ties between the two sides, challenges remain in fostering deeper cooperation. This concern is indeed reflected during the third AU-EU ministerial meeting.
[8]
Among the challenges the upcoming summit is facing is whether the EU remains a major partner in financing African peace and security infrastructure, as it was witnessed in various peace operations on the continent. The EU’s decreasing interest in backing the continent’s peace and security efforts has been observed in its “shifting from supporting AfSol towards framing EU foreign and security policies with a direct link between African stability and European security (and economic) interests”
[9]
could be mentioned. Leaders in the EU and major member states are paying closer attention to Europe’s peace and security, especially after the 2022 war between Moscow and Kyiv. Furthermore, the emergence of right-wing groups in Europe has led to a decline in interest in African affairs. These instances are among the major factors that cast a shadow on the trajectory of the partnership between the two sides.
Another area of divergence between the two sides is military coups in the Sahel, which have caused diplomatic friction among regional states and with some European states. In an effort to fill the security vacuum left by European powers, extra-regional geopolitical actors and rivals are vying to forge new allies. Sahel states may not participate at a higher level at the upcoming summit due to increasingly precarious diplomatic relations with some European Union member states. Besides, the current geopolitical reality that shows alternative security and economic arrangement like that of BRICS Plus and its members inroads to Africa to build a closer ties with African states in tandem of the admission of Ethiopia and Egypt into the organization tend to compel the EU to refrain from “claiming Africa’s unique partner.”
[10]
Hence, there is a possibility of not giving weight to the coming summit as equal as its predecessors.
Currently, the global south is calling for reform of the international institutions established in the wake of the end of World War II. Even from the global north, particularly the EU, there is interest in backing the AU in its call for the democratization of international institutions to address the embedded unfairness and unrepresentativeness in the changing geopolitical and geo-economic order. Notwithstanding its commitments in joint declarations and summits, the EU is still criticized for failing to translate them into reality. Such a trajectory, according to a recent report by ECDPM, will incentivize “Africa and the wider Global South to continue to develop alternative institutions or gravitate towards non-Western power blocs such as the BRICS.”
[11]
Another challenge that could affect the partnership between the AU and the EU is related to the model of the partnership between the two sides that has changed from what it was twenty-five years ago. Development aid, migration, and financing the peacekeeping operations were previously the major pillars of cooperation. Currently, however, investment, the fight against irregular migration, energy security, and access to strategic minerals has come to the forefront of the discussion table. It seems that a “transactional approach”
[12]
tends to highly affect the relationship between the two sides in the coming years or decades. As a result, the predominant mantra of “solidarity with the global south [Africa]” could be sidelined in future engagements. Rather, interests will dominate the discussion amid rising security uncertainties across different pockets of the continent. Furthermore, the third Russia-Africa summit that is scheduled to convene in one of the capitals of Africa by next year may cloud the condition of the coming summit and its subsequent effort to translate the declaration into reality.
Conclusions
In retrospect, the prior summits between the AU and the EU envisaged to build a deepening partnership anchored on “common values, equality, mutual respect, and cooperation.” Looking after twenty-five years of cooperation, there are still shortcomings in building political, economic and cultural ties that are reciprocated by mutual benefits while looking at the foregoing determinants stand between the two sides. Notwithstanding the challenges and uncertainties the international community has witnessed, the AU and the EU member states need to bolster their shared commitment to address global and continental challenges more than ever. Otherwise, foregoing trends will cast a shadow not just to the coming summit, but also the future partnership.

TITLE: Unleashing Atomic Potential: Why Is Ethiopia Turning to Nuclear Energy Now? – IFA

Executive Summary
Ethiopia is a strategic inflection point in its energy policy. The High-Level Ministerial Roundtable on Ethiopia Nuclear Power Programme held recently in Addis Ababa with the help of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is a step forward in replacing plans with action. The nuclear energy is currently positioned as a fundamental national development tool, geared towards mitigating structural energy deficiencies, industrialization, and energy sovereignty on national level. A nuclear programme, which is well regulated, peaceful, internationally supervised is a strategic need. Ethiopia is experiencing acute climatic vulnerability, increasing energy needs, and geopolitical dangers of over-exploiting scarce resources. Non-diversification at this point threatens to bring economic stagnation in the long, hydrological fragility, and underdeveloped industry. Gradual, safety-first nuclear, coupled with renewable energy, will offer predictable, low-carbon energy, technological innovation, and increase the resilience of Ethiopia and its independence.
Context and Rationale: The Imperative for Energy Diversification
The energy system in Ethiopia exhibits great success but it is extremely susceptible. More than 90 percent of the installed generation capacity is hydropower, which makes Ethiopia a leader in renewable in the region (Trade.gov, 2025; Survey.amu.edu.et, 2025). However, this reliance puts the nation at the risk of drought, seasonal fluctuations, and cross-border political risks (MDPI, 2024; ABJOL.org.et, 2024). Untapped potential energy sources—such as solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass—limit the country’s energy access and adaptability (Trade.gov, 2025). Diversification of energy is not an option anymore, it is a strategy that is needed. Increasing the energy mix improves the resilience of the system, creates a fair access point, attracts investment, and deals with climate risks and geopolitical risks (ClimateChangeNews, 2025). Nuclear energy is used to supplement hydropower and renewables and gives the economy a solid, dense and weather-independent base-load.
Rising Energy Demand and Hydrological Vulnerability
Electricity demand is rapidly growing with population growth, urbanization and industrial expansion. With large-scale investments in hydropower, the rural population is left underrepresented, and frequent outages of power limit the productivity and investment (MDPI, 2024; Academic.oup.com, 2025). Peak demand is usually greater than the supply, so there is a need to resort to expensive and polluting back-up sources. These problems are complicated by climate variability. The extended droughts lower the level of reservoirs, initiate the process of load-shedding throughout the nation, and complicate the energy security and the upstream-downstream geopolitics. Nuclear power is predictable and a constant energy source that does not depend on weather and other external forces.
Ethiopia is pursuing nuclear power to address a critical gap between its rapidly growing electricity demand and its over-reliance on hydropower, which currently accounts for 90% of its energy.
While projects like the GERD have increased capacity, the nation remains highly vulnerable to climate-induced droughts and seasonal rainfall variability. By integrating nuclear energy, Ethiopia aims to create a more stable, low-carbon power grid that can support its expanding industrial economy and 120 million citizens regardless of weather conditions.
Strategic Energy Security and Sovereignty
Ethiopia’s decision to pursue nuclear energy is essentially a strategic one to protect the national energy security and enforce sovereignty. Energy security is not just being able to have access to power, but a diversified portfolio against systemic weaknesses. An excessive dependence on hydropower puts the nation at a climatic and geopolitical risk. Seasonal droughts lower the level of the reservoirs which results in the load shedding in the whole country leading to interruption in the production of industries, commerce, and services delivered to people (MDPI, 2024). Further, the dependency on the Nile basin interconnects national energy security with upstream and downstream politics and it is a potential point of vulnerability to exogenous forces. To overcome these weaknesses, nuclear energy offers the country a constant predictable and weather-free supply of electricity that will enable the nation to supply the base-load power demand irrespective of climatic changes.
In addition to resilience, nuclear energy reinforces Ethiopia’s strategic independence. By generating a considerable amount of electricity domestically, the country can decrease its reliance on energy imports from neighboring nations. This strengthens Ethiopia’s bargaining power in the regional arena and ensures a more autonomous energy policy.  The nuclear programme is also part of the industrialization agenda of Ethiopia and some of the high-tech industries, manufacturing clusters, and the emerging infrastructure projects will have uninterrupted power supply. In this respect, nuclear energy will act as a buffer against exterior shocks and a mechanism of long-term economic and technological independence, which will be the foundation of a stronger, independent country.
Policy Arguments: Why Nuclear Energy Is a Strategic Necessity
Nuclear power is not a luxury, but a strategic investment in Ethiopia’s future development. The economic impacts of failure to diversify the energy source are significant: chronic power outages, limited industrialization and further dependence of imported fossil fuels or local energy systems. As a reliable, large-scale, and low-carbon base-load source, nuclear power helps stabilize the energy system by providing a grid anchor; this allows variable renewable sources, such as solar and wind, to be integrated into the system more effectively (Trade.gov, 2025; ClimateChangeNews, 2025).
Although the initial capital outlay is significant, it should be viewed as a strategic investment that fosters industrial strength, energy security, and long-term development resilient to climate change.
Moreover, nuclear energy is an effective engine for industrialization and the creation of high-skilled jobs. The Ethiopian government’s programme for green steel, fertilizer production, and electric mobility rely on an assured power supply. Thousands of high-tech jobs for engineers, researchers, and technical service providers will be created during the construction, operation, and regulation of nuclear facilities. In addition to direct employment, the program encourages a domestic supply chain for high-level components and promotes technological innovation in fields such as materials science, medicine, and agriculture. (Academic.oup.com, 2025). This forms a virtuous cycle where energy security, industrial development and human capital development strengthen other ones.
The international supervision is equally important in enhancing the safety and credibility. The IAEA cooperation with Ethiopia helps to guarantee the compliance with international standards of nuclear safety, security, and waste disposal to reduce political and operation risks. Quite on the contrary, this kind of supervision boosts public trust and international confidence that offers a good ground to domestic and regional acceptance. Diversifying energy sources by adopting nuclear power does not only ensure stable electricity supply but also a high level of strategic sovereignty, less susceptibility to hydrological and geopolitical shocks and leadership of the region, as a technologically prospective state.
Challenges and Risk Mitigation
Nuclear energy has transformative advantages; however, it is a complex entity that needs financial, technical, regulatory, and social risks to be managed. There are also major problems of financial and technical constraints because nuclear plants demand large initial investments, lengthy construction periods, and technical skills and expertise. In order to avoid these challenges, Ethiopia ought to consider adopting a gradual approach to investment, by initially undertaking small scale projects like Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), which have relatively small scale, are inherently safe and can be used in off-grid or industrial settings. Enhanced financing systems such as the support of the international development banks, public-private associations etc. can also be used to lower the fiscal load as well as help to meet climate and development goals (Trade.gov, 2025).
Another important factor lies in regulatory and institutional capacity. The Ethiopian Nuclear Energy Commission (ENEC) should be an independent body that is strong and technologically competent to control licensing, safety checks, and response to emergencies. Enhancing the ENEC needs to have sufficient legal power, long-term financing and strategic human resource growth. It needs twinned arrangement with other experienced nuclear regulators, intense training programmes, and compliance with the principles of the IAEA safety culture in order to be confident that the operations are performed on the highest standards on the planet and people are still confident.
Lastly, social license and public communication are the key to long-term success. The issue of safety, management of radioactive wastes, and location of the facility will have to be resolved by conducting open, long-term and participatory engagement programs. Public confidence may be strengthened by showing the practical benefits of the nuclear energy such as the creation of local employment, the enhancement of infrastructure, its use in medicine, agriculture and research. Technical rigor with proactive community activity can support Ethiopia in the development of the social license that can guarantee the support of the population and the sustainability of the long-term program (ClimateChangeNews, 2025; MDPI, 2024).
Policy Recommendations
To navigate the technical and financial complexities of nuclear integration while ensuring the highest standards of safety and public trust, the Government of Ethiopia should adopt the following strategic policy measures:
1
. Hasten Regulatory Frameworks: Enact all inclusive safety, liability, licensing and emergency response legislation according to IAEA specifications.
2. Focus on Human Capital Development: Introduce national scholarships, professional training, and cooperation with international nuclear education institutions.
3. Embraced Staged Deployment: The implementation of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) should be used as a small step into industrial sectors and remote locations.
4. Enhance International Cooperation: Maintain IAEA control and diversify technology partners so that there is flexibility and maximum transfer of knowledge.
5. Make Transparency Institutional: Publicize milestones, safety reviews and audits to gain confidence inside and out.
Conclusion
Ethiopia’s entry into the nuclear power sector marks a historic turning point, transitioning the nation from energy vulnerability toward technological sovereignty. With rigorous regulation, strategic alliances, and active stakeholder engagement, nuclear energy has the potential to revolutionize Ethiopia’s energy landscape. More than just a power source, it serves as a catalyst for industrialization, resilience, and sustainable national prosperity. By embracing this path, Ethiopia secures its position in a sustainable, independent, and technologically advanced future.

TITLE: Ethiopia’s Quest for Sea Access: Navigating Peaceful Diplomatic Strategies – IFA

As one of the few civilizational states, Ethiopia has had contacts with ancient civilizations through caravan and long-distance commercial activities using the Red Sea coastal access points. It was one of those states engaging in the Red Sea region for a number of strategic reason such as security, commerce and international relations. Due to various domestic, regional and international ruptures, however, Ethiopia’s sovereign access and control of the Red Sea region faded away over the years. Ethiopia has, at least four times, lost and regained access to the Red Sea region. The rise of Islam in the Middle East in the 7
th
C AD and its subsequent expansion to the Red Sea region, the expansion of the Ottoman Empire and control of the Red Sea in the 17
th
C. AD, the Italian colonial establishment in Northern Ethiopia, present day Eritrea (1896-1942), and independence of Eritrea in 1993 were some of the factors that left Ethiopia landlocked. Time and again, Ethiopia lost and regained control of the Red Sea illustrates Ethiopia’s past and present undying zeal and ambition to get access to the Red Sea.
While being an economic and military power in the Red Sea region, Ethiopia has been affected by being landlocked. It is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. However, most of the economic dividends are paid to the countries providing access for the transit of goods and services to and from the international market. Currently, over 85% of the nation’s import-export trade activities are dependent on the Djibouti port which in turn demands the payment of rents in cash – one of the highest transit costs in the world. This is keeping other factors such as misappropriation, delayance, constant inspections and monitoring, and mishandling constant. Also, due to lack of storage capacity, Ethiopia is often forced to prioritize import-export items of goods and services. Much of the goods to be exported to the external markets are primary products and seasonal – making the prioritization of goods highly inconsistent. This affects economic development.
Aside from economic development perspectives, there are also strategic reasons related to national security vulnerabilities that the country has suffered from by being landlocked. The Red Sea is one of the most dynamic regions in the world characterized by interstate and intrastate conflicts, hot-bed for external powers rivalries, proxy conflicts and cross-border crimes, piracy and armed robberies and international terrorism. Since Ethiopia is few miles away from the Red Sea coasts, these security developments are highly concerning. Gaining access, therefore, helps identify the national security vulnerabilities and define the types of responses to be taken.
The last loss of Ethiopia’s sovereign access to the Red Sea region was following the independence of Eritrea in 1993. However, the quest of getting access to the sea has been securitized for decades that followed. Discussing or raising issues related to Ethiopia’s access to the sea used to cause mortal danger until the 2018 reforms. The question of getting access to the sea that has been simmering in the background and became public, especially following Prime-Minister Abiy Ahmed’s (PhD) parliamentary speech in October 2023 stating that “Ethiopia needs access to the Red Sea coasts.” This was followed by the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding for port development with the
de facto
state of Somaliland in January 2024 in return for considering the recognition of Somaliland – which has irritated the surrounding littoral states.
There are several mechanisms in which landlocked states can secure either direct or diversified access to the open sea. These includes, bilateral agreements signed with transit states, building of ports through concessions or land lease with full management and operation rights for a prescribed period, constructing canals or artificial waterways, and connecting all ports and infrastructures through regional corridor projects involving both littoral and non-littoral states. Situated at the center of the Red Sea and the Horn of African growing economies, Ethiopia can ensure possession of reliable sea access through all possible mechanisms discussed above with the exception of canals which are currently unavailable in the region. Most importantly, the ongoing plan to connect the region through the LAPPSET corridor presents one alternative to meet Ethiopia’s demand for diversified sea access. This is in addition to the port development agreement signed with the
de facto
state of Somaliland through concessions – which serves as an additional access point within the interconnected LAPPSET corridor.
Ethiopia’s recent quest for access to the sea has significant national and geopolitical implications. Nationally, it has reignited long-suppressed public aspirations for maritime access. Gaining access to the sea contributes to alleviating the economic challenges the country has been exposed to including but not limited to high transit costs and other issues stemming from being the largest landlocked country in the world. From a strategic perspective, the pursuit of sea access also aims to address security vulnerabilities arising from the Red Sea region, including piracy, armed robbery, cross-border crimes, and terrorism. Given Ethiopia’s status as a regional economic powerhouse with one of the strongest militaries in Africa, it could play a crucial role in fostering robust regional economic and security cooperation, thereby reducing the interventionist agendas of proliferating global and regional powers in the area. However, this does not come without costs. It has also some adverse geopolitical implications resulting in heightened interstate tensions, formation of unhealthy regional alliances against Ethiopia, and, if not carefully managed, has the risk of proxy conflicts involving global and regional powers. The recent Ethiopia-Somalia tension and the formation of the Asmara-Cairo-Mogadishu axis can be significant manifestation.
Recommendations
The following can be policy alternatives that need to be carefully pursued to balance Ethiopia’s renewed interest in the Red Sea region and the subsequent geopolitical tensions;
Heighten negotiating/bargaining power – Landlocked states have the right to negotiate for a direct or diversified access to access the sea. As a landlocked country, Ethiopia needs to maximize its ability to bargain with the neighboring coastal nations. It offers various consumer goods to littoral states in the region, including foodstuffs, freshwater, and electricity throughout the year. These goods can serve as leverages to secure either direct or diversified access to the sea or, at the very least, to obtain reduced costs for the transit of goods and services.
Focus on diversifying access through corridor projects – Relying solely on one direct or transit access route is insufficient for Ethiopia, considering its rapidly growing economy and population. Currently, corridor projects are emerging as vital tools for overcoming geographic trade barriers. They are transforming traditional interstate trade and commercial ties by connecting various networks and infrastructures. Securing diversified access for Ethiopia is a top priority, as it leads to lower transit costs and enables the exchange of a wider range of goods to and from the international markets. This diversification enhances competitiveness of transit costs among transit providers and reduces customs-related expenses, making Ethiopia more attractive to potential transit or access providers.
Promote regional economic and security cooperation – The Red Sea region has experienced challenges in economic and security cooperation, likely due to the lack of institutional and material capacity among its littoral states to foster regional economic integration and establish robust security partnerships. As a significant economic and military power in the region, Ethiopia possesses the necessary capability to enhance economic cooperation and address regional security vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is vital to align Ethiopia’s pursuit of sea access with broader objectives of regional economic cooperation and security alliance in the Red Sea region.
Avoid unhealthy regional grouping/alliances – Gaining direct or diversified access to the sea for a landlocked state heavily relies on the political will and mutual benefits. Ethiopia’s pursuit of sea access has unsettling effect on littoral neighbors, who perceive it as a “threat”. This situation has led to short term interstate tensions and the formation of unhealthy regional groupings. However, prioritizing peaceful and regional solutions could provide Ethiopia with the strategic advantages in navigating these tensions. This context allows Ethiopia to gauge the reactions of its neighbors and work to prevent unhealthy alliances mushrooming the region.
Reinstitute naval power – As one of the landlocked nations with merchant fleets operating in international trade, Ethiopia needs a strong naval presence in the Red Sea region due to the increasing maritime threats. A plot of land in either the western or eastern half of the Red Sea is essential to serve as docking point to responding to growing maritime threats. Currently, there are over 14 foreign naval bases and military facilities in the western half of the Red Sea and along the Indian Ocean coasts. Responding to maritime threats from inland is costly and naturally challenging. Therefore, a naval presence is crucial for addressing threats to Ethiopia’s merchant fleets operating in international waters and for maintaining a healthy flow of goods to and from the global market.
Careful oversight of Red Sea regional security platforms – In response to regional maritime threats such as piracy and armed robberies, several platforms have been established that involve both littoral and non-littoral states. Some of these platforms include Ethiopia, while others do not. As a nearby non-littoral state in the Red Sea seeking direct or diversified access, it is essential to examine the intentions and objectives of these platforms particularly that exclude Ethiopia from membership. By closely monitoring these platforms, the country can better understand ongoing developments in the region and ensure that its national interests are safeguarded.

TITLE: 𝐃𝐞-𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐳𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐍𝐢𝐥𝐞: 𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐄𝐠𝐲𝐩𝐭 𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐚 𝐋𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐨𝐧 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐓𝐮𝐫𝐤𝐢𝐲𝐞-𝐈𝐫𝐚𝐪 𝐖𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐂𝐨𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐞𝐚𝐥 – IFA

Last year, in late April 2024, Iraq and Türkiye signed
several agreements
and memoranda of understanding, where a framework agreement on water policy cooperation was particularly worth to be mentioned. This original framework marked a new phase of better relations between the two neighboring countries after years of strained ties. More recently, in line with the framework, a few days ago, the two countries signed a landmark deal based on the principle of “give and take”, putting oil and water on the transaction table.  In this perspective, Baghdad and Ankara agreed on the “
oil-for-water
” deal, containing several details and specific mechanisms on the
implementation o
f water cooperation framework between the two countries. Among others, these mechanisms include channeling oil-based petro-dollars from Iraq to Turkiye, which in turn, serves as a means to execute water related projects in Iraq. The agreement also gives opportunity for Turkish companies to build Iraq’s water infrastructure.
During the signing ceremony, representing the downstream country, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussen
praised the deal
, describing it as the “first-of-its-kind cooperation on water management” between neighboring countries. This reflects the potential of the deal to be served as a bench-mark for other countries, seeking the same suit. Similarly, his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan said: “After long years, Turkiye and Iraq are cooperating on water.” Beyond the signatory countries, several countries including the
United States of America
congratulated Baghdad and Ankara on their success – reaching an agreement.
In light of the prevailing context, we firmly believe that no recent agreement has contributed more to effective water management than the cooperation framework introduced by Iraq and Türkiye. Undoubtedly, it stands as a timely and pragmatic model of regional water cooperation, allowing the flow of Trans-boundary water resources, Euphrates and Tigris, in a manner that benefits both the upper and downstream countries. In this connection, the Nile River presents no obstacle to the implementation of the same path the Iraqi-Türkiye Model—except for Egypt’s excessive self-interest, which is heavily dependent on outdated colonial agreements. It is, therefore, vitally important for Egypt to draw constructive lessons from the Model, thereby prioritizing cooperative framework to the GERD dispute. As Ethiopia repeatedly reiterated, Egypt’s long-term water security will be best achieved through a win-win approach rooted in genuine water diplomacy, not through conspiracy or meddling in the internal affairs of riparian states, especially Ethiopia. Egypt’s traditional reliance on intimidations and subversive tactics has proved nothing more than the reality that such attempts have no habitat in today’s geopolitical landscape. Otherwise, Egypt will remain a downstream country forever and cannot have more rights than Ethiopia with respect to the Nile River – strikingly, this is a divine fate, not decided by Ethiopia or other upper riparian countries.
Possible Scenarios for Egypt
Despite the realities outlined above, it remains challenging to predict whether Egypt will take a lesson from the Turkey–Iraq water cooperation deal. The outcome, however, hinges on whether Egypt de-securitizes the Nile, its long-serving position. The following are probable scenarios that can be discerned from the existing dynamics.
De-securitization of the Nile – the Most Highly-unlikely Scenario
Egypt has long “securitized” negotiations regarding the Nile waters, embedding this issue in the
Constitution
of the Arab Republic of Egypt as part of its national security priorities. The preamble, for instance, states,
Egypt is the gift of the Nile and the gift of Egyptians to humanity
.
Article 44
which is devoted entirely to the Nile, guarantees every citizen’s right to
enjoy the River Nile
and prohibits encroachment on the riverbank reserve or harm to the riverine environment, implicitly recognizing the Nile as Egypt’s primary water source
. The
article further
asserts that the Nile is
a historic right of Egypt
. Given these constitutional principles, it is highly unlikely that Egypt would engage in negotiable deals with any of the riparian states, particularly Ethiopia, regarding Nile waters. De-securitizing the Nile would require removing certain principles embedded in the Constitution, a prospect that seems improbable due to Egypt’s recent internal political instability and fears of public backlash. Consequently, it appears impossible for Egypt to pursue negotiable agreements concerning the Nile in the foreseeable future, which explains its frequent withdrawal from successive dialogues and formal discussions centered on the equitable share and reasonable utilization of the Nile waters.
Enhanced Security Cooperation in the Red Sea region – the Best Scenario
If Egypt were to de-securitize the Nile and open negotiations, though this is highly unlikely due to constitutional and legal constraints, it could facilitate security cooperation between Egypt and Ethiopia in the Red Sea region. Such cooperation would serve the interests of both Ethiopia and Egypt in relation to the Nile and the Red Sea. Egypt has repeatedly made unfounded claims that Ethiopia has violated international watercourse regulations and jeopardized Egypt’s historical rights by constructing development projects on the Nile, such as the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). Meanwhile, Ethiopia has asserted that Egypt incessantly employed diplomatic maneuvers to isolate it from accessing the Red Sea and has excluded it from any Red Sea related security cooperation, notably the “Red Sea Council,” by skillfully establishing exclusionary criteria. Therefore, Egypt’s de-securitization could have benefited both nations and the entire region offering enhanced security cooperation.
Continue with the Status quo – the Most-likely Scenario
De-securitizing the Nile in Egypt’s national security and foreign policy could increase public pressure against the faltering regime. Therefore, it seems likely that Egypt will maintain the status quo, continuing to frame the Nile as a critical national security priority. In this context, Egypt will portray its traditional diplomatic stance, arguing that any negotiations regarding the Nile waters will benefit neither the staggering regime nor the Egyptian public. This is the most plausible scenario for Egypt, which is unlikely to accept any deal regarding the Nile waters. Securitizing transnational resources, however, lacks international legal grounds and fails to produce constructive outcomes. Consequently, if no agreement is reached, Egypt will remain a downstream country indefinitely, unable to claim more rights than Ethiopia regarding the Nile – an outcome determined not by Ethiopia or other upstream nations, but by an inherent reality.
Concluding Remarks
The bilateral agreement initiated by Turkiye and Iraq based on the principle of “
oil for water
” could have served as a pivotal example for managing similar transnational water resources, such as the Nile. This could potentially ease the intransigent position that Egypt has historically maintained regarding Nile waters and foster greater security cooperation in both the Nile and Red Sea regions. However, since issues concerning the Nile waters have long been “securitized” by Egypt and backed by national normative grounds, it is highly unlikely that Egypt will adopt a similar approach regarding Nile-related issues in the foreseeable future.

Ethiopia’s quest for sovereign access to the sea is not merely a geographical ambition; it is a profound struggle for identity and belonging in a world that has often relegated it to the margins. As Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed revitalizes this long-held aspiration through the recent Memorandum of Understanding with Somaliland, the stakes rise beyond trade routes and economic growth—this journey symbolizes Ethiopia’s fight against historical isolation and its desire to reclaim its rightful place within the global community.
Following the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Ethiopia and Somaliland in January 2024, which will grant Ethiopia access to the sea, the federal government of Somalia responded in a different manner. While Mogadishu has chosen to securitize the MoU, portraying it as a threat to its sovereignty, Ethiopia has long regarded access to a permanent seaport as an existential necessity. As a result of Somalia’s securitization, the issue has been escalated, with Somalia linking it to other issues such as the Post-ATMIS transition and inviting other actors, including Egypt and Eritrea, who have an adversarial mentality and perception towards Ethiopia. This has led to the entanglement of bilateral issues, including the MoU, Post-ATMIS transition, and the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), resulting in a sort of trilateral alliance. This piece examines Ethiopia’s journey towards accessing a permanent sea port, its policy choices, and the responses of Somalia and other regional actors.
For centuries, Ethiopia’s quest for access to the sea has been a tumultuous journey marked by periods of progress and setbacks, as well as unwavering perseverance and resilience. While the physical geography of the sea and the country’s physical security are undoubtedly crucial aspects of this journey, the story of Ethiopia’s pursuit of the sea is ultimately rooted in a deeper need: the need to maintain a sense of biographical continuity that includes the narratives that have shaped the country’s identity and its relationship with the world.
For Ethiopia, except during the EPRDF era, accessing the sea was considered an existential matter. However, the Red Sea-centered foreign policy orientation was tactically silenced following Eritrea’s independence in 1991, de facto, and in 1993, de jure. This marked a significant departure from the pre-existing narrative, as the government (EPRDF period 1991-2018) voluntarily abandoned Ethiopia’s claim to the sea and politicized the issue, characterizing those who raised it as expansionists and
war-monger
.
Although Ethiopia’s loss of sea access was caused by a combination of historical, geopolitical, and international factors including the 16th-century Portugal-Ottoman Empires rivalry and the 19
th
and late 20 century British-Italian-French rivalry it was primarily the policy orientation of the EPRDF that transformed Ethiopia into a landlocked country and
ended the struggle for permanent sea access
. This EPRDF’s siloed worldview curtailed the generations-long quest for a permanent seaport, aligning with the intended policy objectives pursued by Ottoman Empire, European colonial powers, and post-independent Egypt. It was not the aspirations of the people that were realized, but rather those of
Egypt
, a country that supported insurgents and secessionists, including the EPLF and TPLF, from the beginning. Under the EPRDF’s siloed worldview, the narratives that regarded access to the sea as an existential matter were reduced to viewing ports as mere tradable
commodities
.
The regime also delinked access to the sea from its existential necessity for development and national security, believing that it had no strong causal link. This was further legitimized by the double-digit economic growth of the time. As the late PM Meles Zenawi stated: “If we don’t use the two ports [Misewa and Aseba],
we lose nothing
…. Being landlocked does not make us poor…. We cannot and should not suffer from being a landlocked nation…In terms of development and growth, Ethiopia experienced its quickest results ever”. However, this view overlooks the reality that the country’s economic growth and strategic interests have been constrained by its lack of direct access to the sea, creating a dependency on a single sea outlet.
Ramification of being landlocked
Landlocked developing countries like Ethiopia engage in 30% less trade, on average, compared to their coastal counterparts, leading to slower economic growth—about 1.5%
lower
due to their landlocked status.This situation has resulted in higher import prices and decreased export revenues, with transportation costs being a major challenge. Ethiopia heavily depends on Djibouti for nearly 80-90% of its imports and exports, which has driven up transport expenses. In 2023, the country faces an enormous annual cost of
$1.6 billion
in port fees due to its lack of direct sea access.Additionally, the port of Djibouti struggles to keep up with Ethiopia’s rising trade demands and its rapidly expanding economy. Issues such as lengthy transit times (averaging around 50 days), high logistics costs for imports, inconsistent customs practices, and delays at the port all contribute to Ethiopia’s
elevated logistics expenses
for bulk imports.
In addition to the economic ramifications of being landlocked, Ethiopia’s geographical status positions it as a passive observer in the geopolitical dynamics of the Red Sea Theater, where major and regional powers actively engage. This landlocked condition exacerbates Ethiopia’s security vulnerabilities, as it becomes increasingly reliant on the maritime strategies and decisions of its neighboring coastal states, thereby diminishing its own strategic autonomy.
Furthermore, the country’s lack of direct access to the sea significantly constrains its military capabilities, limiting it to land and air power. This geographical limitation hampers its ability to project power and influence maritime security in the region. As a result, Ethiopia is compelled to rely on land and air power, which may not adequately address evolving security challenges from non-state actors like terrorists and pirates.
Hence, Ethiopia’s quest for sovereign, permanent access to a seaport emerges as a panacea for the strategic and economic challenges that constrain its physical and ontological security. This pursuit is not merely about enhancing trade routes or gaining a physical advantage; it represents a fundamental effort to reclaim a sense of belonging in the global community that has been eroded by geographical isolation. Ethiopia’s lack of coastline has historically fostered feelings of disconnection from the strategic dynamics of the Red Sea region, intensifying the country’s sense of vulnerability.
In the wake of the post-2018 reforms, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has rejuvenated these longstanding aspirations, framing access to the sea as not only a national priority but also a
matter of survival
. This strategic rebranding has shifted the discourse from questioning the importance of maritime access for development to a widely accepted understanding that it is an existential imperative for Ethiopia.
This sovereign access to the sea has been driven by a complex interplay of domestic, regional, and international factors, including economic, demographic, and strategic considerations. The country sought a more diversified sea access, taking into account the country’s rapidly expanding economy, growing population, and desire for regional integration. Regionally, while the physical distance between Ethiopia and the Red Sea coast is relatively short, in reality, Ethiopia has become a distant observer of the Red Sea Theater, as the region has hosted several military bases of major and middle powers from distant regions. Furthermore, neither relying on Djibouti nor port diversification, which comes as a policy choice for Ethiopia’s dependency on Djibouti, has met Ethiopia’s import-export demands. Furthermore, the lack of a permanent seaport has impacted the country’s strategic and political interests.
One outcome of this policy choice is the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between Ethiopia and Somaliland on January 2024. The MoU follows Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s statement on Ethiopia’s peaceful access to the sea, which marks a significant shift after 27 years of voluntary abandonment of Ethiopia’s claim to a permanent seaport. The agreement, according to the statement made by the Foreign Minister of Somaliland, grants landlocked Ethiopia
access to the sea
, and in return, Ethiopia reciprocates by recognizing Somaliland as an independent state. Under the terms of the agreement, Ethiopia will secure less expensive and more reliable access to the sea, leasing a 20-kilometer stretch of coastline for 50 years. The agreement also allows Ethiopia to build a naval base and develop a commercial port on the strategic Gulf of Aden.
However, the MoU paradoxically has become entangled with the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), reconfiguring the interstate relations in the region. Mogadishu has interpreted the MoU as an existential threat to its territorial integrity and sovereignty. In response, it has opted for the securitization of the MoU and alliance formation as deterrence. Egypt and Eritrea have also joined the securitization of the MoU aimed at countering Ethiopia’s sovereign access to the sea. The Cairo-led alliance escalated its subversive activities in the region following the recent entry into force of the Nile River Cooperative Framework Agreement.
The new geopolitical developments in the region seem to have offered Cairo a new geopolitical opportunity to initiate a tripartite coalition of Cairo, Asmara, and Mogadishu. The formation of a tripartite alliance to counter Ethiopia is a continuation of Cairo’s long-term strategy to undermine the position of Ethiopia in the region. While Cairo-Asmara-Mogadishu’s path has been one of securitization, Addis Ababa has taken a de-escalatory approach, employing tactical de-escalation and strategic de-securitization. Ethiopia has emphasized that its sovereign access to the sea is achieved through peaceful and diplomatic means based on give and take. Ethiopia’s strategy focuses on regional cooperation and economic integration, aiming to establish stability and mutual benefit in the Horn of Africa. Ethiopia’s emphasis on peaceful and diplomatic means contrasts with Cairo-Asmara-Mogadishu’s tripartite coalition’s more aggressive tactics, highlighting a fundamental difference in approach to regional issues. By prioritizing cooperation and integration, Ethiopia seeks to foster long-term stability and prosperity in the Horn of Africa.
In this connection, Ethiopia has offered its sovereign projects, including the GERD, Ethiopian Airlines, and Ethio-telecom as a concessions. Speaking to the parliament on October 31, 2024, PM Abiy Ahmed also outlined Ethiopia’s strategy, which is a win-win approach with the states of the Horn of Africa.
..Peaceful neighborliness is Ethiopia’s sole realistic approach to its neighbors, whether they are Somalia, Kenya, Eritrea, or others. Together, we must develop the give-and-take mentality. We are committed to helping any country establish a friendly and cooperative foundation. Peace with Eritrea is necessary. For Somalia to remain a state, thousands of Ethiopians have been sacrificed. Ethiopia will make greater efforts than before to promote peace, development, and the common good in the
Horn of Africa…”
Ethiopia’s de-securitization approach aimed to deescalate tensions, but the government in Mogadishu has linked the MoU to several unrelated issues, including the GERD, the post-ATMIS transition, and broader regional peace and security concerns. This has not only complicated the situation but has also drawn external actors with malign intentions into the region, potentially jeopardizing peace in inter-state relations in the Horn.
The Mogadishu government is facing a constitutional crisis. The Hassen Shieke administration has been leaning towards a more centralizing and unitary approach in relations between the federal government and regional states in Somalia, taking lessons from Eritrea while ignoring the importance of de-centralization and federalism as the best options for stability in Somalia. It’s unlikely that Egypt will take a leading role in the fight against Al-Shabab; rather, Egypt has an interest in encircling Ethiopia rather than in helping to alleviate the security burden of fighting the Al-Shabab and bringing stability and peace to the Somali people.
Furthermore, the Mogadishu governments’ securitization methods failed to achieve their stated purpose of terminating the MOU. Mogadishu’s efforts to tie the MOU and complicate Ethiopia’s desire for a sea outlet appear to have failed, as it has failed to rally regional governments and significant donors to oppose Ethiopia. Despite Mogadishu’s attempts to garner support against Ethiopia, many regional governments and donors have chosen to remain neutral or support Ethiopia’s position.
Ethiopia’s access to the sea has the potential to boost regional connectivity and trade. Ethiopia’s diplomatic de-escalation and strategy to de-securitize should be analyzed in the context of state behavior and the motivations, strengths, and interests of regional actors. It is essential to adapt to shifting dynamics while pursuing diplomatic avenues to realize Ethiopia’s dream of open access to the sea.

TITLE: Walking the Talk: Green Modelling Ethiopia in Africa and Beyond – IFA

By: Solomon Tekalign(PhD)
Ethiopia accounts for less than 0.1 percent of emissions, yet it is already experiencing the adverse effects of climate change. Particularly, in the last five years, it experienced severe drought as well as flooding together with landslides that resulted in loss and damage to large communities.
Despite this fact, Ethiopia has made landmark climate action from planning through resource mobilization to transformative climate actions in agriculture, Green Legacy, E-mobility, Corridor Development in cities, Eco-tourism, etc. which undoubtedly have great potential to attract partners for support.
Some of the major climate actions include but are not limited to wheat production initiative, climate-smart practices, the Bouncy of the Basket (Yelemat Tirufat), the Great Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, and a range of projects suitable for Green Bond financing, including Renewable energy generation (solar, wind, and hydropower), sustainable agriculture initiatives, Climate-resilient infrastructure development, etc.
Regarding the GLI, which was initiated by PM Abiy Ahmed in 2019, Ethiopia was able to plant 40 billion tree seedlings that enhance its forest coverage to 23.6 percent with a potential carbon sink of over 10 billion tons. The government earmarked about 1 percent of its annual budget for the GLI and Land Restoration Fund.
Similarly, the heat-resistant wheat production project came up with an output of 107 million quintals of wheat in the last three years. This contributed much towards a sustainable food system by having carbon-negative and climate-resilient crops.
In addition, Ethiopia has now become among the few countries in the world to pass a law banning fuel automobiles as part of reducing the impact of greenhouse gas emissions. Ethiopia, through its corridor development program, prioritizes a people-centered and climate-smart approach to reverse this alarming trend. In this context, Addis Ababa is a testament to this success while the exemplary practices are being replicated in regional and provincial cities to enhance the greening effects. Likewise, there are rural green initiatives and rural electrification effects that is designed not only to enhance carbon-free energy to the largest community but also to secure food security at the household level too via its Yelemat Tirufat (the Bouncy of the Basket) Project.
Moreover, Ethiopia has adopted its subsequent Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), long-term low-emission government, and national adaptation plan that guide the collective commitment to significantly lessen the impacts of climate change.
This can be scaled up further by having global support for such endeavors. So, Ethiopia aspires and hopes to translate its Paris Agreement Commitment into tangible actions. This will contribute to the collective reverse of humanity’s trajectory of destruction and do justice to the victims of climate change impacts, particularly for developing countries like Ethiopia and beyond.
Together with this, the message of PM Abiy Ahmed (PhD) upon COP 29 disclosed that Ethiopia will fulfill the Paris Conference Agreement and COP 28 responsibilities. The main aspects of the agreement include increasingly ambitious climate actions towards zero carbon solutions. While of COP 28 was to speed up the transition away from fossil fuels to renewables such as wind and solar power in their next round of climate commitments. Similarly, Ethiopia is ambitiously determined to meet the Paris Conference Agreement and of the COP 28 commitments.
Conversely, the debate on climate finance has become overly complex and painstakingly slow-paced. It underscores the imperative to simplify the process and come up with practical and pragmatic solutions. In this regard, Ethiopia hence pragmatically focused and emphasized the need to finalize the new collective quantified goal on climate finance and make it operational. Ethiopia wants to share its experiences with Africa and beyond which can be enhanced through the green finance that is expected to be agreed at COP 29. It is finally calling the global community to come together to create an enabling zero-carbon sustainable environment for the coming future.

Ethiopia’s Strategic Positioning Amidst Possible Rise in US-China Rivalry Following Trump’s Second Term.
ADDIS ABABA’S WORLD WITHOUT HUNGER CONFERENCE: EXPECTATIONS AND OUTCOMES

### 103

TITLE: Ethiopia’s IMF Program: The Crucial Insights from the Fourth Review – IFA

Ethiopia has reached a notable milestone in its ongoing economic reform agenda following a staff-level agreement between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Ethiopian authorities on the fourth review of the country’s Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement. Subject to approval by IMF management and the Executive Board in the coming weeks, the agreement is expected to unlock approximately USD 261 million in new financing. This would bring total IMF disbursements under the program to about USD 2.13 billion, out of the USD 3.4 billion facility approved in July 2024 to support Ethiopia’s Homegrown Economic Reform (HGER) agenda. While the immediate financial injection offers short-term relief, the broader significance of the review lies in Ethiopia’s ability to sustain one of Africa’s most determined economic reform programs amid debt restructuring pressures, post-conflict recovery, and far-reaching monetary and fiscal adjustments.
According to the IMF staff team, led by Alvaro Piris, implementation of the ECF-supported program has delivered favorable macroeconomic outcomes. Economic growth has accelerated, inflation has declined, and the value of goods exports has more than doubled within a year. These outcomes reflect a relatively strong reform momentum, with the program’s disbursement rate now standing at roughly 62.5 percent. A central driver has been the liberalization of the foreign exchange regime in July 2024, which effectively eliminated the parallel market premium and improved price discovery and transparency. This shift, combined with tighter monetary policy, has helped stabilize expectations despite an initial depreciation of the birr.
Export performance has been further strengthened by increased gold production, partly due to the formalization of previously informal supply channels, as well as a rebound in agricultural exports. These gains have improved external balances and enhanced Ethiopia’s capacity to finance essential imports and meet external obligations. At the same time, the export base remains concentrated in a limited range of commodities, leaving the economy exposed to price volatility and external shocks. Inflation dynamics nonetheless suggest growing policy credibility, as price pressures have moderated in spite of currency adjustment, reflecting improved supply conditions and disciplined macroeconomic management. The IMF has underscored the importance of continuing efforts to deepen foreign exchange market liquidity and develop risk-hedging instruments to support private sector activity and investor confidence.
Debt restructuring remains a pivotal, yet unresolved, component of Ethiopia’s stabilization strategy. The program is anchored in the G20 Common Framework, under which Ethiopia reached a memorandum of understanding with its Official Creditor Committee in July 2025. This step represents meaningful procedural progress, but the process is incomplete, as bilateral agreements—particularly with major creditors such as China—have yet to be finalized. Until these negotiations are concluded, a portion of IMF financing will continue to be absorbed by debt servicing rather than redirected toward growth-enhancing public investment. Restoring full debt sustainability is therefore essential, not only to regain fiscal space but also to rebuild market confidence and attract private capital.
Economic growth has gathered pace since mid-2024, driven by sector-specific developments. Gold exports have emerged as a major contributor to foreign exchange earnings, although part of this increase may reflect statistical reclassification rather than purely organic expansion. Energy generation from the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) has strengthened domestic power supply and enhanced Ethiopia’s potential as a regional electricity exporter, even as the project remains entangled in sensitive geopolitical dynamics with downstream riparian states, notably Egypt. Agriculture has also shown signs of recovery, supported by favorable weather conditions and targeted policy incentives, though productivity gains remain vulnerable to climate variability and logistical constraints.
These positive trends should be interpreted with caution. Much of the observed acceleration reflects recovery from a low base following years of conflict, pandemic disruptions, and macroeconomic imbalances. Sustaining growth at higher levels will require deeper structural transformation, including diversification away from primary commodities, expanded infrastructure investment, and sustained improvements in human capital. Without these shifts, current gains may prove difficult to maintain over the medium term.
The reform agenda also carries significant political and institutional implications. Currency depreciation, subsidy rationalization, and fiscal tightening have imposed tangible costs on urban households and the middle class, raising concerns about social tolerance for continued adjustment. Ethiopia’s federal structure, combined with regional disparities and post-conflict sensitivities, complicates the consistent implementation of reforms across the country. While the IMF has emphasized inclusive consultations with financial institutions, the private sector, and development partners, maintaining a broad domestic consensus remains a delicate task.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s administration has thus far managed to balance reform ambition with political realities, but more demanding phases lie ahead. Planned measures such as civil service reform, state-owned enterprise restructuring, and deeper financial sector reforms could test institutional capacity and political cohesion. Experience from other reform episodes suggests that reform fatigue can emerge once distributional effects become more pronounced, making sustained political commitment a critical variable in the program’s success.
Looking ahead, Ethiopia has already implemented several high-impact reforms, including exchange rate liberalization and initial fiscal consolidation. Future reviews will focus on more entrenched and politically sensitive measures, such as subsidy phase-outs and banking sector recapitalization, which may expose underlying vulnerabilities and provoke resistance from vested interests. External risks—including global commodity price swings, regional instability, and tighter international financial conditions—could further complicate the adjustment path. Domestically, deepening foreign exchange markets and completing debt restructuring will be essential benchmarks for long-term macroeconomic viability.
Beyond its national implications, Ethiopia’s experience under the ECF carries broader relevance for the African continent. As Africa’s second-most populous country and host of the African Union, Ethiopia’s reform trajectory serves as a test case for the effectiveness of the G20 Common Framework in delivering timely and meaningful debt relief. Its approach to exchange rate liberalization offers lessons on managing currency transitions without triggering runaway inflation, while its gradual shift from a state-led to a more market-oriented development model may inform similar efforts elsewhere, provided political contexts allow for adaptation.
In conclusion, the fourth review of Ethiopia’s IMF program affirms tangible progress in stabilizing the economy, with notable gains in exports, inflation control, and growth. Yet the durability of these achievements will depend on resolving outstanding debt negotiations, deepening structural reforms, and cushioning the economy against external shocks. The outcome of this program will not only shape Ethiopia’s economic destiny but also influence debt-distressed peers across the continent, highlighting the interplay of policy resolve and global cooperation in fostering sustainable development.

Asmara’s Isolation Doctrine: Why Eritrea Rejects Prosperity in a Changing Horn

TITLE: Asmara’s Isolation Doctrine: Why Eritrea Rejects Prosperity in a Changing Horn – IFA

The relationship between Ethiopia and Eritrea extends far beyond formal diplomacy. The two nations share intertwined histories, cultures, languages, and social foundations that long predate their modern political separation. Since Eritrea’s 1993 independence, they have remained linked by more than 1,000 kilometers of border and deeply interdependent political and socioeconomic trajectories.
In the decades that followed, relations oscillated between moments of cooperation and phases of tension—from early optimism to devastating war, proxy hostilities, cold peace, and eventual normalization in 2018 after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (PhD) came to power. Yet even after peace resumed, Eritrea’s internal political crisis continued to drive hundreds of thousands of Eritreans into Ethiopia, particularly Addis Abeba, seeking safety and dignity. Their migration reflects both the social closeness of the two peoples and the harsh conditions under Eritrea’s authoritarian rule. Few show any desire to return under current circumstances.
Drawing from years of study and close observation, I argue in this article that the blessings and burdens shared by Ethiopia and Eritrea are rooted in a common past, shaped by the present, and decisive for the region’s future. This article examines how Eritrea’s one-man dictatorship has undermined its own national prospects and obstructed peace and stability across the Horn of Africa.
Eritrea After Independence: Promises kept or sacrifices let down?
Thirty and a half years after independence, Eritrea should have been one of Africa’s rising states—blessed with prime geography and a coastline along one of the world’s most strategic waterways. Instead, it remains among the continent’s most closed, militarized, and impoverished nations.
This stagnation is no historical accident. It is a deliberate political choice. President Isaias Afwerki has engineered a system in which prosperity is treated as a threat, regional cooperation as vulnerability, and isolation as a strategy for regime survival. Eritrea’s tragedy is not simply underdevelopment—it is the purposeful construction of poverty, weaponized to preserve undeserved political power.
This brings to my mind a point made by Gedion Thimotewos (PhD), Ethiopia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, during the Foreign Policy Forum held last month about the Eritrean regime’s miscalculations. He described what he called “Isaias’ doctrine”—the idea that President Isaias takes pride in achieving Eritrea’s political independence while simultaneously believing that Eritrea can rely on Ethiopia for everything it needs for its socioeconomic well-being, even after Eritrea’s secession.
Peace without freedom, stability without growth
Most nations seek peace as a platform for institution-building and economic progress. Isaias’Eritrea seeks peace to immobilize society.
For nearly thirty and a half years, the Eritrean leadership has viewed peace not as a tool for transformation but as a minimal condition: no open conflict and no meaningful socioeconomic change. After three decades, Eritrea still has no implemented constitution, no democratic elections, no independent media, no dynamic private sector capable of innovation, and no open borders that allow the flow of commerce, ideas, or information.
Instead of creating positive peace—peace that expands opportunity and nurtures social well-being—the government offers only the absence of open conflict. It uses this absence of war as justification for the absence of progress.
Poverty as policy, conflict as governance
Where most authoritarian states use economic benefits to secure loyalty, Isaias’Eritrea relies on scarcity to enforce obedience.
The indefinite national service program has immobilized an entire generation, ensuring that poverty remains engineered rather than accidental. Hunger becomes a political tool, and exhaustion becomes a form of control.
The indefinite national service program has immobilized an entire generation, ensuring that poverty remains engineered rather than accidental.”
Externally, the regime sustains and inflates tensions with neighboring states to legitimize permanent militarization. For Asmara, conflict is not a diplomatic failure; it is a governing strategy.
The ruling elite believes that a society trapped in daily survival is easier to dominate than a society empowered by economic opportunity. In Eritrea, this calculation has allowed one-man rule to endure for decades.
While Isaias’Eritrea exports instability across the Horn of Africa, it shows little interest in improving the lives of farmers, workers, or urban residents inside the country.
In effect, the regime competes not with neighboring states but with the well-being and future of its own people, using public policy to deepen poverty so that political control remains unchallenged.
The coastline that was never allowed to prosper
Eritrea possesses one of Africa’s most valuable coastlines. The ports of Massawa and Assab could have evolved into thriving logistics hubs along the Red Sea, integrated with booming Gulf economies and positioned along one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.
However, the regime views openness as a threat and isolation as a form of security. Prosperity would empower citizens; poverty keeps them dependent and controllable.
While Eritrea closes itself off, landlocked Ethiopia—ambitious and outward-looking—is rapidly expanding its maritime partnerships through Djibouti, Somalia, and Kenya. Ethiopia’s economic growth could have been Eritrea’s greatest opportunity, yet Asmara regards Ethiopia’s dynamism as a threat to its internal political structure.
Five rationales behind Ethiopia’s quest for sea access
Ethiopia’s determination to secure diversified and reliable sea access is often misunderstood. The country’s approach is shaped by historical realities, geographic necessity, international law, developmental logic, and diplomatic principles.
First, Ethiopia’s position is supported by historical precedent: from the Aksumite era until the 1990s, the country maintained access to the Red Sea, and its loss was the outcome of decisions made by unelected guerrilla leaders rather than democratic processes.
Second, Ethiopia’s geography—as the world’s most populous landlocked country with more than 120 million people—makes permanent reliance on a single port corridor unsustainable.
Third, international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, affirms the rights of landlocked states to secure access to the sea through negotiated agreements, which aligns with Ethiopia’s current approach.
Fourth, Ethiopia argues that maritime cooperation benefits the entire region. Countries such as Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia, Somaliland, and Kenya can all gain from Ethiopia’s massive market, growing trade volume, and advanced infrastructure. Prime Minister Abiy has repeatedly expressed Ethiopia’s readiness to share the advantages of its major national institutions—such as Ethiopian Airlines, the expanding telecom sector, and even the benefits of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD)—as part of mutually beneficial agreements.
Fifth, Ethiopia’s strategy emphasizes peaceful, negotiated solutions. The government insists that any arrangement must be rooted in dialogue, consensus, and broader regional security considerations, recognizing that maritime stability is inseparable from peace in the Horn of Africa.
Together, these five principles form what Ethiopian officials call “the golden pathways to the sea.”
A future bigger than one man’s fear
Eritrea stands at a historic crossroads. It can continue functioning as a hyper-securitized, inward-looking state whose most tragic export is its youth—or it can unlock the prosperity that its geography and people naturally promise.
The world must acknowledge that Eritrea’s stagnation is not an accident. It is a system of institutionalized poverty designed to preserve authoritarian rule.
But no government can permanently suppress the aspirations of its people. Nor can Eritrea isolate itself from the transformations reshaping the Horn of Africa. Ultimately, the country’s future will be determined not by the fears of a single ruler but by the resilience of a population that has endured immense hardship—and still preserved hope.

Flowing Uphill: How Ethiopia is Reversing the Power Dynamics of the Nile
Ethiopia’s IMF Program: The Crucial Insights from the Fourth Review

TITLE: Flowing Uphill: How Ethiopia is Reversing the Power Dynamics of the Nile – IFA

GERD is more than a hydropower project; it’s a geopolitical pivot. This analysis explores how the dam is shattering a century-old status quo and redefining power in Northeast Africa.
In the unforgiving arena of geopolitics, nations are driven by one primal instinct: survival. For too long, the narrative surrounding the Nile has been dictated by downstream powers, framing the river as their historical right and Ethiopia’s development as a threat. This era is over.
The completion of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is more than an infrastructure project; it is a profound geopolitical pivot. It is the moment Ethiopia moved from a nation pleading its case to a nation projecting its power, transforming its geography from a constraint into a commanding strategic asset.
As noted in a previous analysis on
Abren
,
“From the River to the Sea: Ethiopia’s Geopolitical Destiny”
, Ethiopia’s historical sovereignty over the source of the Blue Nile has rarely translated into leverage. For centuries, the nation was caught between its own needs and the demands of downstream capitals. The GERD has shattered that paradigm.
The dam is not merely a source of electricity; it is a source of national pride and unassailable negotiating strength. It is Ethiopia’s ultimate bargaining chip in a world governed not by morality, but by the ruthless law of the fittest. To remain relevant and secure, a nation must command respect, and the GERD does exactly that.
The corridors of power in Cairo now echo with alarmist rhetoric, a testament to this shifted balance. They claim simultaneously that the GERD causes both water shortages and flooding—an impossible contradiction that reveals their true anxiety. It is not about the Nile’s flow, which technical assessments consistently confirm remains unaffected for downstream nations. The real contest is for leverage and regional dominance. Egypt’s growing unease stems from Ethiopia’s undeniable emergence as an economic and geopolitical force in the Horn of Africa.
Egypt’s persistent demand for a “binding agreement” is, in essence, a coded attempt to control GERD from within Ethiopia’s borders. But let us pose an honest question: if the roles were reversed, would Cairo ever allow Addis Ababa to dictate terms over the Aswan High Dam? The answer is self-evident. In fact, Egypt explicitly excluded Ethiopia’s involvement in the construction of its own Aswan high dam. Emperor Haile Selassie’s request on information was rebuffed in the 1950s. Ethiopia was systematically excluded from any meaningful dialogue or data-sharing regarding the Nile throughout the 1950s.
This demand for veto power is a historical anomaly. When Türkiye built 22 dams on the Euphrates and Tigris, no downstream nation was granted control. When China erected massive dams on the Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra) or when the U.S. built the Hoover Dam, neither India nor Mexico sought binding oversight. Why, then, should Ethiopia be held to a different standard? The language of “historic rights” is a language of the weak; the language of sovereign development is the language of the strong.
This dynamic is not unique to the Nile. Across the globe, the same pattern endures: power respects power, while weakness invites interference. In the Gulf, Saudi Arabia and the UAE cooperate when interests align but compete fiercely for dominance. In Asia, the rivalry between China and India mirrors their relentless pursuit of global stature.
Ethiopia, with the GERD, has entered this arena not as a supplicant, but as a peer. It has demonstrated the strategic wisdom to build a project that commands respect, forcing the world to acknowledge its right to utilize its own resources for the prosperity of its people.
Yet, true survival in geopolitics requires more than raw might. It demands the strategic wisdom to negotiate, to cooperate, and to build partnerships without surrendering sovereignty. The future will not belong merely to the strong, but to the wise.
Ethiopia’s path is clear. It must continue to champion equitable and reasonable utilization, as enshrined in international water law. It must engage with Sudan and Egypt, not from a position of weakness, but from the solid foundation of its operational dam and its unwavering national resolve. The goal is not to beggar thy neighbor, but to turn a zero-sum rivalry into a collective opportunity for progress, stability, and shared energy security in the region.
The GERD is the embodiment of a new Ethiopian destiny—one where it is no longer defined by the river, but defines the river’s future. The arena is unforgiving, but for the first time in a long time, Ethiopia is not just a participant; it is a power.

IFA, FLJI Hold Workshop on Hague Apostle Convention and Ethiopia’s Ratification

TITLE: IFA, FLJI Hold Workshop on Hague Apostle Convention and Ethiopia’s Ratification – IFA

High-level officials and legal experts gathered at the Pyramid Hotel in Bishoftu today, December 20, 2025, for a national consultative workshop co-organized by the Institute of Foreign Affairs (IFA) and the Federal Justice and Law Institute (FLJI).
The forum examined the legal framework and strategic implications of Ethiopia’s potential ratification of the Hague Apostle Convention, signaling a significant move toward modernizing the nation’s document authentication system and streamlining international trade and legal cooperation.
The workshop focused on a comprehensive research report titled
“The Legal Framework and Implementation System of the Hague Apostle Convention: Significance and Implications of its Ratification in Ethiopia.”
Joining the convention would eliminate the often-cumbersome, multi-layered “legalization” process for public documents, replacing it with a single “Apostle” certificate recognized by all member states.
H.E. Jafar Bedru, Executive Director of the IFA, emphasized that the convention is a “primary international legal instrument” central to Ethiopia’s diplomatic and economic interests.
“It has become essential to examine its benefits and implications for our country in depth,” H.E. Jafar noted. “It is believed that ratifying this Convention will play a significant role in streamlining the document authentication system in a way that supports Ethiopia’s development and growth.”
The Director General of the Institute of Law and Justice, Honorable Ambassador Degfe Bula, underscored that the move toward ratification is not merely administrative but a pillar of the nation’s broader economic diplomacy. He highlighted the necessity of ensuring that such transitions are “grounded in knowledge and evidence.”
“These platforms allow for research-based policy options to be developed,” Ambassador Degfe stated. “They provide an opportunity to weigh the pros and cons of complex policy alternatives in a clear, scientific, and evidence-based manner… rather than deciding in isolation.”
While the opportunities for increased efficiency are clear, the Q&A sessions revealed a cautious approach. Officials acknowledged that while Ethiopia’s existing digital and physical infrastructure is “in good shape,” challenges and potential threats to national interests remain.
The consensus among leadership was that the ratification process must be handled with precision. H.E. Mitiku Mada, Deputy Director of the FLJI, emphasized that the current study is still being refined to address identified gaps before a final policy is launched.
“The Apostle Convention is crucial for Ethiopia but should be joined with due caution,” H.E. Mitiku remarked during the closing session. “We should focus on the national interest of Ethiopia before we delve into adopting the convention.”
The findings of this workshop are expected to serve as a “vital baseline input” for Ethiopia’s high-level leadership. The final policy recommendation will aim to balance the ease of international business with the protection of national legal standards.
The event saw attendance from senior leadership, including Honorable Ambassador Fitsum Arega, Director General of the Ethiopian Diaspora Service, alongside a wide array of diplomats, legal researchers, and stakeholders from across the justice and foreign relations sectors.

TITLE: Addis Ababa Launches Landmark Space Diplomacy Forum, Positioning Africa for a Unified Future in Space – IFA

The Addis Space Diplomacy Forum Inauguration 2025 took place today, 11 December 2025, at the Elilly Hotel in Addis Ababa under the theme
“Strengthening Continental Partnership for Space, Development and Shared Prosperity.”
Organized by the Space Science and Geospatial Institute (SSGI) in collaboration with the Institute of Foreign Affairs (IFA) and the Africa Space Leadership Institute (ASLI), the forum marks a major milestone in Africa’s pursuit of a coordinated and forward-looking space agenda.
The event convened African space experts, policymakers, and international partners to craft a shared vision for the continent’s future in space.
Opening the forum, ASLI Co-founder Etim Offiong called for a single African passport and visa-free mobility to accelerate integration, noting ASLI’s work to align future strategies with Agenda 2063 and position Addis Ababa as Africa’s emerging space diplomacy hub.
Dr. Gizachew Asrat, Chief of Staff and Senior Researcher at IFA, highlighted Africa’s growing space ambitions and the need for stronger continental cooperation to leverage space science for peace, development, and shared prosperity. “Addis Ababa is poised to become Africa’s hub for space diplomacy,” he said, aligning national and continental agendas with IFA’s mission to elevate African agency in global governance.
Dr. Abdi Zenebe, Deputy Executive Director of IFA, emphasized Ethiopia’s recent milestones—including the PTRS-1 satellite launch and the establishment of SSGI—describing partnerships as vital pathways for development, peace, and collaboration.
UNECA’s H.E. André Nonguierma praised Ethiopia’s advancements and stressed the urgency of forging a unified African voice in global space governance.
SSGI Deputy Director-General Dr. Yeshurun Alemayehu called the forum a historic step toward Africa’s strategic autonomy in space, underscoring the need to strengthen the continent’s data and space infrastructure.
Melaku Mulualem, IFA’s Director General for Training, outlined Africa’s three strategic priorities—Human Capital, Institutional Frameworks, and Infrastructure—reminding participants that “space is not merely technology; it is diplomacy.”
Speakers urged unified policies, greater investment, and sustained capacity-building to accelerate Africa’s global role in space diplomacy.
Participants concluded with a shared commitment to deepen collaboration among governments, institutions, and development partners to advance space diplomacy, unlock socio-economic gains, and secure a permanent and influential African presence in the global space arena.

The attendance of neighboring heads of state during the inauguration of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) demonstrates a moment of Horn of Africa solidarity, countering narratives that GERD is solely Ethiopia’s concern.
Since its inception in 2011, Ethiopia has consistently called on the lower riparian countries, Sudan and Egypt, for fair and equitable utilization of the Abbay River [Nile]. However, Egypt has persistently cast doubt on Ethiopia’s legitimate call, clinging to colonial-era treaties that completely excluded Ethiopia, the source of more than 85% of the Nile’s waters.
Egypt has attempted to frame the GERD as a source of tension, instigating Sudan and using proxy measures against Ethiopia through neighboring countries. The presence of the heads of state of Somalia, Djibouti, and Kenya—all from the Horn of Africa—during the GERD inauguration marks a landmark diplomatic shift in favor of Ethiopia and the wider Horn, projecting GERD not only as a national project but also as a regional one benefiting the entire region.
Despite Somalia’s growing alignment with Egypt (particularly regarding Red Sea and Nile politics), President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud’s presence at the inauguration is significant. During his remarks, he acknowledged the GERD’s importance as an anchor symbolizing the common wealth of the Horn of Africa. He emphasized Somalia’s commitment to unwavering regional peace and integration, recognizing that GERD benefits not only Ethiopia but also Somalia and the region at large. His presence signals a diplomatic gesture that could bolster the Ankara Declaration with Ethiopia—an agreement granting Ethiopia sea access via Somalia. It may also represent a balancing act: supporting Somalia’s historically, socially, and economically tied neighbor Ethiopia, while maintaining strategic ties with Egypt.
Djibouti, another strategic Horn of Africa state, also endorsed the GERD through its president, Ismaïl Omar Guelleh, who called the inauguration a historic day and described the GERD as an African project. Djibouti, host to multiple foreign military bases—including those of the U.S., China, France, and Gulf States—sent a message of neutrality and interest in regional stability by attending the event. President Guelleh’s framing of the GERD as an African project, rather than merely an Ethiopian one, reinforces this stance. Ethiopia has already begun exporting electricity to Djibouti, and President Guelleh’s speech suggests Djibouti’s interest in strengthening electricity interconnections and economic cooperation.
President William Ruto’s presence further reflects Kenya’s support for Ethiopia’s development sovereignty and its role in promoting cooperative regional infrastructure. In his keynote speech, he described the day as a moment of monumental historical significance—both a feat of engineering and a bold affirmation of Africa’s capacity to shape its own destiny. Kenya, which has positioned itself as a diplomatic hub in the Horn through efforts such as the Nairobi Process, Somalia peace talks, and regional mediation, views the GERD as a building block of trust and regional integration. Since Kenya has already begun accessing GERD electricity, the dam serves as a foundation for cooperation and shared destiny in the Horn.
The GERD’s inauguration is also a diplomatic asset showcasing African leadership. The attendance of regional leaders strengthens Ethiopia’s stance against Egypt’s claims of “historical rights” based on colonial-era treaties that excluded Ethiopia. While Egypt has consistently countered Ethiopia’s position by aligning with Sudan, Gulf States, and occasionally Horn states, Ethiopia has stood firm, asserting its legitimate right to use the Nile while calling for cooperation guided by the principle of Limited Territorial Sovereignty—ensuring equitable utilization of trans-boundary rivers. The GERD inauguration can be read as Ethiopia consolidating neighborly support to counter Egyptian influence.
Moreover, the GERD inauguration marks a cornerstone in energy diplomacy and regional integration. The presence of Horn leaders reflects the project’s practical benefits. Kenya, Djibouti, and Somalia all face energy shortages—Ethiopia already exports electricity to Djibouti and Kenya, and Somalia could also benefit. This positions the GERD as an economic driver of regional integration, reducing dependence on external powers.
Ultimately, the attendance of Horn leaders underscores that the GERD is an African matter. Ethiopia has consistently adhered to the principle of “African solutions to African problems,” framing the dam as a matter of African cooperation rather than external intervention. The event highlights Ethiopia’s unwavering commitment to regional integration and demonstrates that Egypt must reconsider its refusal to embrace Ethiopia’s call for shared development.

TITLE: The Golden Jubilee of Diplomatic Relationships: 50 Years of Ethio-Cuba Friendship – IFA

This year marks the Golden Jubilee of the formal diplomatic relationship between Ethiopia and Cuba, a bond established in 1975. This half-century milestone is not merely a diplomatic anniversary; it is a commemoration of a profound, blood-sealed solidarity that helped preserve a nation’s sovereignty.
The foundation of this unique relationship was laid during the brutal Ogaden War. On 13 July 1977, Somalia, under President Ziad Barre, invaded eastern Ethiopia to fulfill its irredentist ambition of creating a “Greater Somalia.” The Somali soldiers advanced rapidly, seizing control of significant territory in the Ogaden region. Ethiopia, simultaneously grappling with internal conflicts against groups like the EPLF (Shabia) the TPLF and EPRP, that led to an existential threat to its territorial integrity.
It was at this critical juncture that Cuba, under the steadfast leadership of President Fidel Castro, answered the call. In a stunning act of international solidarity, Cuba dispatched 15,000 soldiers to fight alongside the Ethiopian forces. At one time Fiedel Castro was asked by a Western journalists how many military advisors and soldiers of Cuba are working in Ethiopia. He responded saying “Why you ask details, I cannot work for CIA”.
The support of Ethiopia was not an isolated act but part of Cuba’s broader commitment to African liberation, having supported freedom fighters in Algeria, Angola, Mozambique, against apartheid in South Africa and the like. As the late President Nelson Mandela once stated, “Cubans are in the hearts of Africa.”
The war was bloody, resulting in massive casualties and displacement. About 163 Cuban soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice, with others taken as prisoners of war in Somalia. Their contribution was decisive. The turning point came at the Battle of Karamara, where the joint Ethio-Cuban forces secured a victory that ultimately chased out the invaders and guaranteed Ethiopia’s sovereignty. By the support of Cuba and other allies, Ethiopia won the war, while Somalia’s ambition lay in ruins. After the death of Ziad Bare Somalia faced state collapse and remained so for decades.
This shared history of struggle created an unbreakable bond. As the saying goes, “A friend in need is a friend indeed.” For Ethiopia and Africa at large, Cuba paid a selfless sacrifice—a policy of “give” rather than “give and take.” The relationship was, as many veterans from both nations who still remember each other’s friendship would attest, cemented by blood.
The diplomatic and personal exchanges further solidified ties. Fidel Castro visited Ethiopia in 1978, attending a military parade in Meskel Square sitting on the Tribune where the former office of the Institute of Foreign Affairs located. President Castro had also travelled to Jigjiga to celebrate the victory. Similarly, President Mengistu Hailemariam visited Cuba in March 1978. During this time it was Castro himself who was driving the car to show his solidarity. These gestures underscored a partnership based on shared values and mutual respect.
In the heart of Addis Ababa stands the Ethiopia-Cuba Friendship Memorial Park. The Park was inaugurated in 1984 during the Mengistu regime’s ten years national celebration. Its 50-meter-high monument, decorated with sculptures of intertwined Ethiopian-Cuban soldiers, is a solemn tribute to the Cuban soldiers and military advisors who fell on Ethiopian soil. In this Park, there are photos of Cubans who lost their life in the Ogaden War. This park has become a living symbol of gratitude, where Ethiopians gathered in 2016 to mourn the passing of Fidel Castro, a man the African Union praised as “a freedom fighter who supported Africa’s struggles.” The then President Mulatu Teshome of Ethiopia attended the funeral service on December 3, 2016 in Santiago de Cuba.
Beyond the battlefield, Cuba’s support extended to nurturing Ethiopia’s future. In a compassionate post-war gesture, about 5,000 Ethiopian children who had lost parents in the conflict received scholarships to study in Cuba. This generation returned as doctors, engineers, and professionals. Today, many Ethiopian graduates from Cuban universities work in vital sectors, while cultural intermingling continues. These opportunities created continuing people-to-people links, including intermarriages and Cuban expatriate communities in Ethiopia. The cooperation also touched on social campaigns. Cuba supported Ethiopia’s national literacy drive, helping adults learn to read and write. And in a lighter, yet enduring cultural exchange, the Cuban love song “Guantanamera” became, and remains, a popular melody in Ethiopia—a tune that symbolizes the warm, people-centered nature of the bond.
As Ethiopia and Cuba celebrate this Golden Jubilee, the relationship rests on a solid historical foundation but is dynamically oriented toward the future. Both nations maintain embassies in each other’s capitals and are actively working to mark a new chapter within the framework of South-South Cooperation.
The current partnership is being expanded through various Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs), exploring renewed collaboration in economics, health, education, and technology. The need to explore more areas of cooperation is clear, building on the unparalleled political goodwill that exists.
This relationship is historically unique, rooted in a shared struggle for sovereignty and justice. It is deepened by the African ancestry of many Cubans—a connection forged through the tragic history of the Atlantic Slave Trade and the role of Afro-descendants in Cuba’s own liberation from Spanish colonialism. This creates a historical and blood relationship between Africa and Cuba that transcends diplomacy.
The durable lesson of the past fifty years is that true partnership is built on principles, not just interests. Cuba’s decisive intervention was a testament to its commitment to African independence and justice. Ethiopia’s enduring gratitude is evident in its remembrance and continued friendship.
As both nations look ahead, the deep-rooted ties—nurtured by veterans, alumni, artists, and diplomats—provide a resilient framework. The Golden Jubilee is not just a milestone to reflect on a heroic past, but a launching pad for a future where the spirit of Karamara evolves into shared victories in development, innovation, and mutual prosperity. The friend in need has proven to be a friend indeed.

Ethiopia and BRICS: from membership to strategic economic partnership

TITLE: The 2025 U.S. National Security Strategy: Implications for U.S.-Ethiopia Strategic Cooperation – IFA

The newly released National Security Strategy signals a
marked reorientation
in U.S. engagement in Africa — moving away from an “aid-first, liberal-democracy promotion” model toward a more selective, partnership-based approach built around trade, investment, and conflict prevention.
Under this framework, Ethiopia — with its strategic location in the Horn of Africa, its history as a U.S. partner in counterterrorism, and its current legitimate calls for sea-access— emerges as a natural candidate for deeper U.S. cooperation. Several key factors explain why.
Firstly, Ethiopia has long contributed to regional efforts to counter militant Islamist movements such as Al-Shabaab. In the most recent
high-level visit
by the U.S., U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) Commander Dagvin R. M. Anderson met with Ethiopia’s leadership to emphasize shared threats from Islamic extremist groups. During the discussion, where Field Marshal Berhanu Jula was the top representative of Ethiopia, it was disclosed that General Anderson
praised
Ethiopia’s ongoing contribution to regional peace and security and confirmed U.S. support for Ethiopia’s efforts to counter terrorism.
The General’s visit to Ethiopia and the subsequent high-level discussion could be a primitive that Washington had taken the importance of strengthen counter-terrorism in the horn of Africa where Ethiopia is a potential long-standing partner. The new Strategy explicitly highlights the resurgence of Islamist terrorism in parts of Africa as a core concern — and underscores the need to cooperate with “capable, reliable states” rather than rely on prolonged large-scale deployments.
Secondly, Ethiopia sits at the crossroads of the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea / Bab el-Mandeb corridor, and the complex web of states and conflicts that stretch from the Horn to the Sahel and central Africa. The November 2025 Strategy names the Horn as a priority region for preventive diplomacy, given persistent tensions involving Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia.
Importantly, Ethiopia’s legitimate trajectory to regain access to the sea — either through Djibouti, a leased port, or maritime access via neighboring coastal zones — now resonates more directly with U.S. strategic goals.
Recent reporting
notes that U.S. backing could lend diplomatic legitimacy to Addis Ababa’s maritime ambitions, as maritime access for Ethiopia “is inseparable from national growth and sovereignty.”
Moreover, U.S. support for Ethiopia’s peaceful pursuit of sea access
was explicitly affirmed
by General Anderson during his 2025 visit. During this visit, he publicly expressed U.S. support for Ethiopia’s peaceful maritime ambitions and indicated he would brief Washington on Ethiopia’s priorities. While holding discussions with H.E. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, he said the U.S. would work with Ethiopia to explore cooperation that helps stabilize the Horn and open new economic and security opportunities.
The new U.S. strategy of shifting from an aid-centric relationship with African states to one oriented toward trade, investment, and mutual economic benefit is the third pillar where Ethiopia could position itself to benefit from it.
For Ethiopia, this could reopen a window of opportunity. The new strategy could potentially reform frameworks like the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).
Ethiopia, with its large population, youthful workforce and promising industrialization efforts, could become a key beneficiary of renewed U.S. trade and investment flows — especially in sectors such as energy, critical minerals, infrastructure, and manufacturing. This dovetails with long-standing Ethiopian ambitions to industrialize, expand export capacity, and reduce reliance on aid by diversifying its economy.
By combining its internal reforms and economic ambitions with U.S. investment, Ethiopia could anchor a new “investment and growth paradigm” — one that aligns with both American strategic objectives and Ethiopia’s development goals.
Moreover, the new Strategy foregrounds preventive diplomacy: the U.S. signals readiness to support negotiated settlements in existing conflicts (e.g., DRC–Rwanda, Sudan) and to prevent emergent ones — including potential flashpoints in the Horn (Ethiopia–Eritrea, Ethiopia–Somalia).
In this context, Ethiopia could play a pivotal role. As a relatively large, regionally influential state in the Horn, Addis Ababa could help broker or lend legitimacy to peace processes, especially if paired with U.S. diplomatic backing. Its renewed outreach to Eritrea over sea-access negotiations as Ethiopian high-level leaders including H.E. PM Abiy Ahmed have indicated, could be a test case — and an opportunity for Washington to deploy preventive diplomacy rather than reactive conflict management. During his November 2025 visit, General Anderson was
briefed
on a constructive exchange on regional security and opportunities for enhanced cooperation
That said, the alignment between U.S. strategic interests and Ethiopia’s ambitions is not without tension or risk. The main challenges involve resolving internal instability, which the government is working on; addressing neighboring states’ misconceptions (particularly Eritrea’s) regarding Ethiopia’s sea access move, which requires careful navigation; and, following its success with the Food Independency Initiative, ensuring the government sticks to the new investment and growth paradigm by avoiding reversion to an aid-dependent mindset.
Overall, the November 2025 U.S. National Security Strategy for Africa marks a turning point. By prioritizing conflict prevention, counterterrorism, investment, and trade — and by signaling selectivity rather than blanket engagement — Washington is opening a window for deeper, more strategic cooperation with states that can deliver. Ethiopia, because of its history, geography, ambitions, and potential, is among the strongest candidates to be such a partner.
The recent visit of General Dagvin Anderson underscores Washington’s serious intent: Ethiopia is no longer just part of a regional portfolio, but a focal point. By coupling diplomatic initiatives (such as sea access), internal stabilization, and economic reforms with its long-standing historical engagement, Addis Ababa could anchor a new model—one where the U.S.-Ethiopia relationship shifts from aid dependency toward shared security, mutual economic growth, and strategic cooperation.
Despite its rhetorical shift from aid to investment, the 2025 U.S. National Security Strategy reveals a narrow and instrumental reading of Africa’s strategic importance—one that risks reproducing extractive and quasi-colonial patterns of engagement. The Strategy explicitly prioritizes Africa’s “abundant natural resources and latent economic potential” and identifies “the energy sector and critical mineral development” as areas offering “a good return on investment” for the United States, including nuclear energy, liquefied natural gas, and mineral extraction (U.S. National Security Strategy, 2025). While framed as mutually beneficial, this emphasis sidelines Africa’s structural governance, industrial, and institutional needs in favor of resource access and market opening for U.S. goods and services. By favoring “capable, reliable states committed to opening their markets,” the Strategy risks reducing African partnerships to transactional arrangements that privilege external demand over endogenous development priorities, thereby reinforcing asymmetries long associated with colonial and post-colonial economic relations (U.S. National Security Strategy, 2025).
Moreover, although Washington has demonstrated constructive diplomatic engagement—most notably by supporting negotiated de-escalation efforts between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo—the Strategy treats peace building largely as a means of stabilizing environments for investment rather than as an end rooted in African political agency. Conflict mediation is framed alongside preventing threats to U.S. interests and avoiding “any long-term American presence or commitments,” signaling a preference for low-cost stabilization over sustained institution-building (U.S. National Security Strategy, 2025). This selective engagement risks leaving the underlying drivers of conflict—competition over resources, weak regional integration, and uneven development—unaddressed. By foregrounding counterterrorism, conflict containment, and mineral security while downplaying Africa’s role as a geopolitical, demographic, and normative actor in its own right, the Strategy may inadvertently perpetuate cycles of exploitation, instability, and external dependency, even as it claims to move beyond the aid paradigm (U.S. National Security Strategy, 2025).

Regime Survival over Regional Cooperation: Eritrea’s Disengagement from Multilateralism

TITLE: Regime Survival over Regional Cooperation: Eritrea’s Disengagement from Multilateralism – IFA

Since achieving de facto independence in 1991, Eritrea has maintained a highly centralised, one‑party political system dominated by President Isaias Afwerki and the People’s Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ). The regime operates without meaningful elections, a functioning legislature, or independent civil society oversight, and continues policies of indefinite national service and internal repression documented by the United Nations and human rights organisations. A UN Special Rapporteur has repeatedly reported grave human rights abuses, including arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, and forced conscription, with no sign of democratic reform over decades of internal and external reporting. As of 2024 an estimated 17 percent of Eritrea’s population had sought asylum abroad, a reflection of persistent repression and limited political freedoms at home that also undermine the country’s standing in international forums. Most of them lived in East Africa. In 2023 2 percent of the country population flees the state.
The Map adopted from UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 2024, cited in Migration Policy Institute, 2025.
Economically, Eritrea remains one of Africa’s most fragile states. Less than six percent of Eritrean land is arable, recurrent droughts and militarised labour policies suppress productivity, and remittances from the diaspora constitute a significant share of GDP amid limited domestic economic diversification. State control extends over roughly 80 percent of GDP, and most Eritreans live in poverty on less than USD 2 per day, with remittances and resource extraction (e.g., the Bisha gold mine) chiefly sustaining the regime and its security apparatus rather than public welfare. These structural economic constraints leave Eritrea with limited financial and administrative capacity for sustained multilateral engagement, encouraging reliance on selective bilateral arrangements that demand less accountability and public transparency.
Eritrea’s pattern of disengagement with multilateral organisations spans decades. After playing a role in early efforts to revitalise the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) in the early 1990s, Eritrea abruptly withdrew from IGAD in 2003, citing dissatisfaction with the organisation’s processes and perceived bias, and remained outside the bloc for nearly two decades. Although Asmara rejoined IGAD in June 2023, it never participated meaningfully in its activities and formally withdrew again in December 2025, asserting that membership offered “no discernible strategic benefit” and reflecting deep skepticism toward regional institutional frameworks. In response, IGAD expressed regret and noted Eritrea’s non‑participation even while it attempted conflict mediation and regional cooperation initiatives. This cyclical engagement illustrates that Eritrea’s relationship with regional multilateralism is characterised by absence and withdrawal rather than sustained cooperation.
Eritrea’s interaction with continental and global institutions has been similarly constrained. In 2025, Eritrea sought to end the mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on its internal human rights situation, submitting a proposal to the UN Human Rights Council to terminate the independent monitoring mechanism. This move marked an unprecedented attempt to weaken accountability mechanisms at the UN level and defensive resistance to scrutiny of its human rights record. Such behaviour underscores Eritrea’s broader reticence to engage in multilateral processes that could expose internal policies to critique or demand compliance with international norms.
Eritrea as a Spoiler in Regional Conflicts: Sudan and Ethiopia
Despite its withdrawal from multilateral frameworks, Eritrea has pursued bilateral and proxy strategies in regional conflicts, notably in Sudan and Ethiopia, where it wields influence through military support and militia engagements rather than institutional cooperation.
In the Sudan conflict, Eritrea has politically and militarily aligned with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), providing training, logistical support, and, according to various reports, even covert deployment of troops to strengthen SAF positions. Eritrean authorities have reportedly facilitated the creation and training of local militias from eastern Sudan including those drawing on eastern tribal networks using camps on Eritrean territory to shape local dynamics in ways favourable to SAF and Eritrean security interests. Observers also point to Eritrea’s role in arms trafﬁcking networks that undermine arms embargoes, and to its strategic diplomacy focused on bilateral ties with Khartoum rather than inclusive, multilateral political solutions. This approach emphasises Asmara’s comfort with bilateral security cooperation over multilateral peace processes in Sudan, as it seeks to manage cross‑border risks and extract strategic advantage in a fragmented regional environment.
Eritrea’s role in the Ethiopian conflict further illustrates its preference for direct military involvement over institutional engagement. Eritrean Defence Forces (EDF) participated alongside Ethiopian federal forces during the law enforcement operation (2020–2022), providing essential manpower that allowed the Ethiopian army to sustain operations and exert control in contested areas. Eritrean troops committed systematic human rights violations, including documented incidences of sexual violence and war crimes actions that continued beyond formal hostilities and contributed to ongoing humanitarian crises in northern Ethiopia. Eritrean forces also reportedly exploited natural and cultural resources in Tigray region, extracting substantial commodities into unregulated markets, in a pattern interpreted as part of a strategic effort to degrade local economic and administrative capacity. These actions reflect Eritrea’s utilitarian engagement in conflict zones, prioritising regime interests and security calculations without accountability to multilateral standards or human rights norms.
Eritrea’s bilateral approach has had enduring consequences for regional stability. In both Sudan and Ethiopia, Eritrea’s military and diplomatic conduct has deepened fragmentation and complicated international efforts aimed at conflict resolution. Its bilateral agreements with Sudanese leadership in 2025, which include security and economic cooperation on projects such as fisheries, mineral refineries, and infrastructure, further solidify ties with SAF while eschewing broader multilateral engagement that could integrate Sudan into regional frameworks. These agreements are pursued outside institutional platforms such as IGAD or African Union (AU) initiatives and signal Eritrea’s strategy of leveraging direct state‑to‑state cooperation to advance its interests.
Economic and Institutional Constraints on Effective Cooperation
Eritrea’s disengagement from multilateralism is reinforced by profound economic and institutional limitations that curtail its capacity to participate effectively in shared governance or collective peacebuilding. The Eritrean economy, constrained by a command structure dominated by state and military interests, struggles with low productivity and widespread poverty; most citizens subsist on limited incomes with minimal social services or economic opportunity. The IMF and other assessments identify remittances as a critical component of the economy, and reports suggest that natural resource ventures such as gold mining are directed more toward regime preservation than public welfare. These economic fragilities reduce the state’s ability to contribute financially or administratively to regional organisations like IGAD or AU programs that require sustained investment and policy alignment.
Such economic constraints intersect with Eritrea’s political culture: an absence of domestic accountability mechanisms, lack of democratic elections, and entrenched authoritarian governance discourage transparency and impede policy reform necessary for constructive participation in multilateral institutions. Without domestic pressure for reform or accountability, the regime has little incentive to align with international norms, instead doubling down on policies that emphasise internal control and bilateral manoeuvring in regional conflicts. This dynamic has contributed to the perception documented by external analysts that Eritrea is an outlier in regional cooperation forums, often acting defensively or disengagedly in contexts where neighbouring states seek collective action on security, economic integration, and political stability.
Eritrea’s disengagement from multilateralism is rooted in a confluence of authoritarian governance, economic fragility, and strategic prioritisation of regime survival through bilateral security and conflict involvement. Its withdrawal from IGAD, resistance to UN human rights mechanisms, and preference for direct engagements in conflicts such as those in Sudan and Ethiopia all exemplify a foreign policy that eschews sustained institutional cooperation in favour of contingent, regime‑centred tactics. This pattern has weakened regional collective responses to shared crises, reduced the efficacy of continental frameworks like the African Union, and complicated international efforts to mitigate human suffering and foster peace. Meaningful change both to Eritrea’s domestic governance and its international engagement would require fundamental reforms that increase transparency, accountability, and integration into cooperative regional mechanisms.
IGAD’s Role Beyond the Criticism
The Horn of Africa states, through the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), wielded significant influence over regional affairs. As a key regional organization, IGAD consistently shaped the policy positions of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and later the African Union (AU) on Somalia, with its frameworks frequently informing United Nations approaches and strategies in the country. In practice, few stakeholders engaged on political or security matters in the Horn without consulting IGAD and the AU, reflecting IGAD’s status as a central voice in regional diplomacy and conflict management.
IGAD’s leadership extended beyond Somalia to encompass broader peace and security concerns in the region. Notably, the peaceful attainment of South Sudanese independence was largely underpinned by IGAD-led mediation efforts, supported by key member states such as Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, and Djibouti. These efforts ultimately contributed to the negotiation and implementation of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which laid the groundwork for South Sudan’s secession. Following South Sudan’s independence, renewed tensions emerged between Khartoum and Juba, particularly over the contested Abyei area. IGAD played a pivotal role in defusing this crisis, facilitating diplomatic engagement between the parties and contributing to discussions on the deployment of peacekeepers. In this context, both Sudan and South Sudan initially advocated for peacekeeping forces drawn from IGAD member states, with Ethiopia identified as a preferred contributor reflecting confidence in the regional organization’s capacity to manage sensitive security arrangements.
Across these engagements from mediating peace processes to shaping continental and international policy IGAD demonstrated its capacity to serve as both a regional convener and peacebroker in the Horn of Africa. Its contributions have been integral to constructing regional consensus, supporting formal peace agreements, and facilitating coordination between African and global actors on issues of peace and security.
IGAD ultimately reflects the commitment of its member states. Unless member states demonstrate genuine political will and undertake meaningful reforms both domestically and at the regional level, IGAD will continue to face significant challenges. After all, it is an institution created, owned, and sustained by the states of the region themselves.

Ethiopia’s Enduring Commitment to Peacekeeping in Somalia: From Intervention to Cooperation

TITLE: Ethiopia’s Enduring Commitment to Peacekeeping in Somalia: From Intervention to Cooperation – IFA

Introduction
The modern era of international peacekeeping began with the creation of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) in May 1948. This first mission, which oversaw the ceasefire between Israel and neighboring Arab states, set the stage for multinational efforts to manage conflicts. In the years that followed, the need for these operations grew significantly, with Africa becoming the main focus for United Nations peacekeeping activities. Currently, half of all global UN peacekeeping missions are deployed across the continent, showing its ongoing challenges with instability and a complicated history.
In this context, Ethiopia has become a key pillar of both international and African peacekeeping. It ranks among the largest contributors of personnel to both the UN and the African Union. Ethiopia routinely sends over 12,000 military and police peacekeepers to crisis zones around the world, with a history of service ranging from Korea to Sudan. However, it is in its immediate region, the Horn of Africa, that Ethiopia’s commitment has been most apparent and sustained. This is especially true in Somalia, a country marked by government failure and ongoing warfare.
This analysis looks at the varied and changing role Ethiopia has taken in peacekeeping operations in Somalia since 1991. It charts the development of this involvement from initial humanitarian actions to ongoing stabilization efforts under the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and its successor, the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) and now AUSSOM missions. Through this examination, the article shows how a regional player uses peacekeeping not just as a diplomatic tool but as an important strategy for enhancing collective security, protecting its own national interests, and fulfilling a sense of regional responsibility.
To understand Ethiopia’s role, we first need to look at the unstable environment that created it: the Horn of Africa. This region is strategically important but suffers from ongoing instability, facing security threats like terrorism and piracy due to competition for resources. At the heart of this crisis is Somalia, where the government collapsed in 1991, leading to a long civil war, clan conflicts, and lawlessness. This breakdown caused severe humanitarian suffering and allowed militant groups, particularly Al-Shabaab, to grow. The resulting chaos crossed borders, leading to refugee movements, illegal arms trafficking, and increased regional insecurity—threats felt acutely by neighboring Ethiopia. The international response initially focused on humanitarian aid during the 1992-1993 famine when militia blockades prompted the U.S.-led Operation Restore Hope. However, the mission’s failure after the deadly 1993 ambush in Mogadishu led Western powers to withdraw, creating a security void. This withdrawal discouraged further large-scale international military intervention, leaving regional actors, especially Ethiopia, to take on more responsibility for stabilizing Somalia.
Ethiopia’s military involvement in Somalia has evolved through three definitive stages, transitioning from unilateral interventionist actions to a cornerstone role in multilateral peacekeeping, and now into a phase of complex geopolitical realignment. Initially, from 1996-2006, Ethiopia acted independently to neutralize direct security threats, culminating in its 2006 campaign against the Islamic Courts Union (ICU). While militarily successful, this intervention fueled local backlash and inadvertently strengthened Al-Shabaab, prompting a strategic recalibration. This led to the second stage, where Ethiopia formally integrated into the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) in 2014, becoming its most pivotal troop contributor—bearing the primary combat burden, securing key sectors, and training Somali forces.
The current third stage, beginning in 2024, is defined by the post-ATMIS transition towards new frameworks like AUSSOM where Ethiopia’s primary role is as a
major troop-contributing country
involved in regional security and counter-insurgency efforts against the Al-Shabaab militant group, and helping strengthen Somalia’s governance and regional peace. The agreement for Ethiopia’s formal deployment within AUSSOM was a result of recent diplomatic efforts (specifically the Ankara Declaration and subsequent high-level talks in early 2025) which resolved previous political tensions and disagreements with the Federal Government of Somalia regarding Ethiopia’s involvement in the mission. Consequently, Ethiopia remains the indispensable security anchor against Al-Shabaab, a leading troop contributor within evolving AU missions, and the central geopolitical catalyst in a regional dispute navigating a fragile, externally-mediated resolution—all in service of its enduring objectives of border security, regional influence, economic access, and enhanced global partnerships.
Ethiopia’s critical role in Somali security is defined by a fundamental tension: it operates as the region’s most potent counterforce against Al-Shabaab, yet its effectiveness is hampered by a hybrid mandate that blurs peacekeeping with combat, eroding its perceived neutrality and escalating risks. This operational dilemma is compounded by Somalia’s internal divisions, which conscript Ethiopian forces into political mediation, and by the enduring legacy of the 2006 intervention, which militants weaponize to discredit the mission as an occupation. Underpinning these immediate obstacles are chronic systemic weaknesses—shortages in manpower and materiel, erratic financing, and the precariousness of short-term mandates—that stifle long-term strategy. To break this costly cycle and convert Somalia from a persistent security liability into a collaborative partner, Ethiopia must champion a comprehensive strategic pivot. This begins with diligently fulfilling the Ankara Agreement, leveraging port access as a mutual economic opportunity to restore diplomatic trust. Concurrently, Ethiopia should recalibrate its security approach by leading within the AUSSOM framework toward a mission focused on Somali capacity-building and precision strikes, while fortifying its own border as a defensive shield against spillover. Diplomatically, it must proactively shape consensus within the AU and IGAD and navigate relations with global powers without firm allegiance. Through this integrated strategy—balancing verified diplomacy, sustainable security, and inclusive economic statecraft—Ethiopia can evolve from a reluctant intervener into the principal architect of regional stability, thereby securing its own frontiers and unleashing its national economic potential.
Conclusion: From Cornerstone to Catalyst—A Role in Flux
Ethiopia’s role in peacekeeping in Somalia since 1991 is not a straightforward tale of humanitarian goodwill; it is a complex mix of national interests, regional duty, and adaptive strategies. From the unilateral actions of the 2000s to its central position within the AU’s mission, Ethiopia has been a crucial player in preventing Somalia’s total collapse and gradually reducing the threat of Al-Shabaab. Its contributions have come at a significant cost in lives and resources, reflecting a deep understanding that its own security is closely tied to Somalia’s stability. As AMISOM transitions to the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) and later to AUSSOM, with a clearer focus on transferring security responsibilities to Somali forces, Ethiopia’s role has changed. It has shifted more towards training, mentoring, and providing strategic oversight while maintaining strong capabilities for counter-terrorism operations. The Somali case shows that in a region of ongoing conflict, lasting peace often relies not only on distant international organizations but also on committed regional stakeholders who have the most to lose from continued instability. Through its peacekeeping commitment, Ethiopia has positioned itself as such a stakeholder. The path to lasting peace in Somalia remains long and difficult, but it would be far more dangerous without its neighbor’s ongoing engagement. Understanding this role is crucial for analyzing not just Somalia’s future but also the changing nature of peacekeeping in an era where regional solutions are increasingly important.
Ethiopia, in collaboration with regional organizations such as IGAD and the AU, should strengthen capacity-building for Somali security forces, enhance regional diplomacy, and increase its focus on community-level stabilization by supporting local governance structures and reconciliation initiatives so that lasting stability can prevail.

TITLE: Beyond Desalination: Can Ethiopia be a Sustainable Water Partner for the Arab Region? – IFA

Introduction
Water scarcity is an escalating global problem, projected to intensify in the coming decades as the number of countries facing absolute scarcity has been witnessing a significant surge. The level of scarcity is also rising at an alarming rate owing to
multiple factors
across different geographical regions. The Arab region, in particular, faces the most acute water insecurity, with average per capita renewable water availability of 1,000 cubic meters annually. This is well below the internationally recognized minimum amount required per annum. In various Arab countries, this figure drops below 100 cubic meters per capita, placing the Arab region among the top water-stressed part of the planet. What makes the situation of this region more concerning is that water
consumption continues
alarmingly from time to time due to rapid economic growth, demographic expansion and accelerated urbanization.
Triggered by the aforementioned complexities, the Arab countries have taken different measures to ensure their water security. A case in point, in this regard, is the proliferation of desalination projects in the region since the 1970s. Recently, Qatar built the world’s
largest desalination
plant, delivering an extraordinary 600 million liters of drinking water per day. In one of the driest parts on earth – the Arab region, the project is more than infrastructure – it is a lifeline. However, the desalination industry by itself is problematic and may not solve the issue of water scarcity in a sustainable manner, demanding a long-term solution. Notably, desalination
by-products
can further exacerbate the already high salinity levels of water in the region – Gulf and Red Sea. This alarms the need for establishing a cooperation framework between the Arab World and the nearby neighboring countries – such as Ethiopia.
Ethiopia’s Pathways to Foster Cooperation with Arab Countries
The idea of strengthening bond between countries is neither new nor uncommon to maintain water security. Ethiopia is an exemplary country, as the Ethio-Djibouti potable water project echoed this reality, albeit from a distance. It is hoped that Ethiopia can play similar roles with neighboring Arab countries, especially whose water insecurity forced them to import water from other countries. For instance, Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia can work together on water (in) security as the later extremely rely on imported water. Evidently, Saudi Arabia
imports water
from Switzerland ($12,967.37K), Austria ($5,043.61K), United Arab Emirates ($3,829.40K) and other countries. Except Egypt, the reality of most countries in the Arab region is not fundamentally different from Saudi Arabia – dependent on imported water. In this connection, despite I have no current updates,
Addis fortune news
reported that efforts of exporting water to Saudi Arabia underwent five years ago. According to the report one of the newest water bottler, Abebe Dinku Water & Non-Alcoholic Beverages, closed a 20-year deal with a Saudi Arabian company to export water.
Obviously, Ethiopia possesses abundant freshwater resources, especially from the Blue Nile Basin, Lake Tana, and highland rainfall. Being known as the ‘Water Tower of Africa’, it can be a potential candidate to contribute to the Arab world, leveraging its geographical proximity. The idea of supplying water to Arab countries via transnational pipelines has been under consideration for several decades. For instance, despite it was not realized, a similar project was drafted between Israel and Turkiye in 1998 to launch an undersea fresh-water pipeline from Turkey via northern Cyprus to Israel. Should Arab states fulfill their freshwater needs through Ethiopia, it would substantially elevate Ethiopia’s regional influence in the Horn of Africa, thereby strengthening its capacity to assert strategic autonomy.
Potential Challenges Facing Ethiopia
Despite Ethiopia is committed to work together with the Arab world in the area of water resources, challenges may arise from some of the Arab countries. Particularly, Egypt may try every avenue to create hassle as usual, very well demonstrated, during the construction of the GERD Project. Egyptians authorities often echo outdated colonial era agreements to silence Ethiopia’s just call for equitable utilization of trans-boundary water resources. Thus, Ethiopia and the Arab countries should jointly champion regional water-sharing mechanisms that meet the genuine interest of upstream and downstream countries. Above all, some esteemed readers may question the feasibility of the project – supplying water to Arab countries – citing Ethiopia’s landlocked status. Indeed, landlocked status cannot prevent the realization of such scheme. Several landlocked countries export water directly or indirectly to other countries. For instance, despite being a landlocked country, Switzerland
exported $1.75
Million dollars of water, making it the 65th largest exporter of water across the world.
Conclusion and Policy Recommendations
Ethiopia possesses abundant freshwater resources, while the Arab world has faced chronic water scarcity and relied heavily on desalination, making external freshwater sources an attractive long-term option. Consequently, Ethiopia can be a sustainable water partner for the Arab Worldthrough various mechanisms. Among others, these include increasing bottled water export, building joint trans-national pipeline project and enhancing virtual water trade. Ethiopia starts to export bottled-water to some Arab countries in small commercial volumes. The country needs to increase its export level and destinations in order to reach more countries. Supplying fresh water through pipelines is another alternative for Ethiopia, as its
experience with Djibouti
permits to do so. Expanding those lessons obtained from the ambitious trans-national water project, spanning 258 kilometers from underground wells in Ethiopia’s Somali region to Djibouti city is vitally important. Last but not least, Ethiopia has the potential to expand its virtual water trade with Arab countries. By increasing the export of water-intensive goods, such as fruits, vegetables, and livestock, Ethiopia can indirectly supply freshwater to Arab countries. The realization of these strategies hinges on fostering a constructive spirit. This sprit should encounter divisive narratives including the partisan notion that
erroneously asserts
the water security of the Republic of Sudan and Egypt is an integral part of Arab national security.

Addis Ababa, October 6, 2025 — The Government of Ethiopia has
registered significant achievements through comprehensive macroeconomic reforms aimed at addressing structural imbalances and fostering sustainable economic growth, President Taye Atske Selassie highlighted during the joint session of the House of Peoples’ Representatives and the House of Federation.
In his address, President Taye underscored the government’s strategic priorities for the current Ethiopian fiscal year, covering economic, political, and diplomatic initiatives. Reflecting on the concluded 2017 fiscal year, he noted positive outcomes across multiple sectors, emphasizing that the ongoing macroeconomic reforms have produced tangible results.
The President cited the inauguration of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and the launch of the Ogaden Liquefied Natural Gas Project as landmark achievements demonstrating Ethiopia’s development progress.
He further noted that Ethiopia’s export sector has expanded, contributing to over 8 billion USD in revenue last fiscal year — the highest in the nation’s economic history — and highlighting the country’s shift from a single-sector to a diversified development strategy.
President Taye concluded that the country’s economy is now showing strong signs of recovery and resilience following the implementation of wide-ranging economic reforms, setting a foundation for sustainable growth and inclusive prosperity.

Background History
Background & History of EPA
Background & History of EEPA
Ethiopia has issued various strategic and institutional frameworks to be applied in the effort to manage the environment. The regulatory framework ranges from the supreme law of the country, the constitution, to various specific environmental standards. Whereas the institutional arrangements extended from the federal to the local levels.
Ethiopia’s Constitution
Ethiopia’s Constitution incorporates a number of provisions relevant to the protection, sustainable use, and improvement of the country’s environment. Article 44 guarantees “the right to a clean and healthy environment,” while Article 43 pledges “the right . . . to sustainable development.” Additionally, Articles 89 and 92 require national policy and government activities to be compatible with environmental health. Article 89 further obliges the government to ensure sustainable development, work for the common benefit of the community, and promote the participation of the people, including women, in the creation of national development policies and programs. Moreover, according to Article 91, the government is duty-bound to protect and support cultures, traditions, natural endowments, and historical sites and objects. The incorporation of these important provisions into the supreme law of the land has raised environmental issues to the level of fundamental human rights.
The Ethiopian Environmental Protection Authority
The Ethiopian Environmental Protecion Authorty (EEPA) is the Federal institution for managing the Environment of Ethiopia. EEPA is responsible to ensure the realization of the environmental rights, goals, objectives and basic principles enshrined in the Constitution.

Message from His Excellency Dr. Belete Molla, Minister of Innovation and Technology
Dear followers of our website
The role of innovative technology capacity building is significant for the development and universal prosperity of a country. Therefore, it requires relentless efforts to adapt technology and innovation policies and plans to the current situation. In our country, since 1987, efforts have been made to bring about structural change by devising and implementing policies, strategies and plans to bring results in the field of science and technology.
It has been believed that it is important to empower the actors in order to reduce poverty by bringing social and economic development to the sector. As a result, efforts have been made to build a workforce that is capable of finding, providing,  adapting the technology that will be used for the proposed change based on the needs of the industry.
Our ministry has been reorganized in accordance with Decree No. 1097/11 to support the indigenous economic direction designed following the national change. The new organization has given it a new capacity to play its role in the national development by making a coherent policy and strategy in the field of technology.

Innovation Development
Coordinate, promote and lead the national Business, tech and Research based Innovation and Startup Ecosystem development.
In particular, the unit operates to meet ministry’s goal to enable the Ethiopia’s startup ecosystem reaching the fourth stage of its life cycle, which would enable Ethiopia’s startup ecosystem to finally integrate with the global fabrics of knowledge, produce a global business model, and achieve high global market reach in the long run. In the near future, the unit places its priority on the first cycle, which is the activation ecosystem life cycle, which is stifled by challenges such as limited ecosystem experience, challenges of resource leakages to later-stage ecosystems that inhibit growth, and also activation cycle success indicators such as triggering the globalization ecosystem life cycle through multiple startups with 100 million+ USD exits and through national resource attraction in some of our regions, such as Kenya’s and Nigeria’s startup ecosystems Among many other activities, the unit technically coordinates Startup Designation Provision Services based on legal and regulatory frameworks.
The government merged the former Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to form the Ministry of Innovation and Technology in 2019.

17th BRICS Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Prime Minister Dr. Abiy Ahmed
Attending the 17th BRICS Summit in Rio de Janeiro and during the opening session on peace and security and global governance, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed focused his remarks on the urgent need for international institutions that can foster mutual trust and enable effective cooperation. He also reiterated the call for comprehensive reforms in the decision-making structures of international financial institutions and global norms towards promoting collective security and shared prosperity.
Ethiopia officially joined the BRICS bloc in 2023, standing shoulder to shoulder with nations committed not only to building an economic alliance but also to advancing a just, equitable, and multipolar world order. As a BRICS member, Ethiopia aims to actively contribute to these efforts, particularly by supporting the expanded representation of emerging markets and developing countries in global decision-making forums.
In his remarks, Prime Minister Abiy highlighted the bloc’s growing influence, stating: “BRICS has grown from a bold idea into a dynamic force for global transformation. With the addition of new members, our collective voice grows stronger, our shared purpose becomes clearer, and our potential expands.”

President Shavkat Mirziyoyev: 2026 to become fundamental in developing all spheres
26.12.2025
On December 26, President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev gave an Address to the Oliy Majlis and the people of Uzbekistan.
-
Over the past nine years, together with you and our people, we have gone through a significant path of development. Our economy has acquired the new quality, we have expanded market relations and social protection, and strengthened the rule of law. Most importantly, the results of our reforms are felt in every mahalla, every family, and by every individual in their daily lives
, - said the Head of State in the beginning of his speech.
Regardless of how difficult the circumstances were, democratic reforms have been consistently continued. Thanks to the support of the people and enthusiasm of our youth, changes in people’s mindset and worldview, a more cohesive society, the initiative and dedicated work of entrepreneurs, workers, and farmers, as well as a friendly foreign policy based on mutually beneficial cooperation, significant achievements have been made in all spheres in 2025.
For the first time in the country’s history, gross domestic product exceeded $145 billion. It was noted that exports increased by 23 percent, reaching $33.4 billion. It was especially emphasized that the gold reserves exceeded $60 billion for the first time.
The volume of foreign investment attracted into the economy reached $43.1 billion, with the share of total investment in GDP at 31.9 percent. Leading international rating agencies raised the country’s sovereign rating from BB– to BB.
Due to fundamental changes in the energy sector, the electricity production was raised to 85 billion kilowatt-hours.
This year, clean drinking water reached the homes of 715,000 residents in 188 mahallas for the first time, and water supply was improved for another 2.3 million people.
This year, 5 million people have started to receive sustainable income, and the unemployment rate has decreased from 5.5% to 4.9%. About 1,5 million people in need have been lifted out of poverty, and for the first time, 1,435 mahallas became poverty-free areas.
168 thousand children from low-income families were admitted to state kindergartens on a preferential basis. Starting this year, an inclusive education system was implemented in 208 kindergartens for the first time.
The poverty rate in the country has decreased from 8.9% at the beginning of the year to 5.8%.
-
When we started this work, one-third of our population lived below the poverty line. Thanks to the implementation of a completely new social protection system, providing over 100 types of services – such as loans, subsidies, and compensations – delivered through the “seven” in mahallas, more than 8,5 million people have risen out of poverty, and unemployment has been reduced by half.
As a result, this year we achieved the target set three years ago to halve poverty by the end of 2026
, - stated the President.
It was noted that the talented youth contributes greatly to the development of New Uzbekistan through major successes in education, science, culture, arts, sport and other spheres.
In the past years, the country has increasingly become an international dialogue platform for discussing global issues. In particular, this year Uzbekistan hosted the 150th anniversary Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, session of the UNESCO General Conference, the Central Asia – European Union Summit and the International Climate Forum.
It was also noted, that at the meeting of the leaders of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan held in March in Khujand, a historic agreement on the junction point of the three countries’ borders was signed for the first time in history, and a “Declaration of Eternal Friendship” was adopted.
At the recently held Consultative meeting of the Heads of State in Tashkent, an idea on the creation of a strategic format for the Central Asian Community to elevate integration processes to a new qualitative level, was proposed. The decision to admit Azerbaijan as a full member of the Central Asian format is of historic significance.
According to the President, this step will undoubtedly strengthen strategic connectivity and stability between Central Asia and the South Caucasus.
In October, an Agreement on Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation between Uzbekistan and the European Union was signed in Brussels. The Central Asia – U.S. Summit held in November contributed to elevating multilateral and long-term partnerships to a fundamentally new level. Last week, at the meeting of the leaders “Central Asia – Japan” in Tokyo, important agreements were reached in the fields of education, healthcare, digital technologies, infrastructure, and industry.
Earlier this week, in Saint Petersburg, a meeting was held with the heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States, which also outlined new directions for our cooperation.
-
All of this is taking our international relations to a fundamentally new level. We will continue to build bridges of cooperation with countries near and far – East and West, North and South,
- noted the President.
It was noted that the values of mahalla and good neighborliness are harmonious, making an invaluable contribution to the further enrichment of social capital.
This is evidenced by the fact that 90 percent of participants in social surveys consider themselves part of the mahalla community, and confirms the high sense of belonging to the fate of our homeland, shows that this institution is primarily a source of social cohesion.
-
No matter how difficult the challenges we faced throughout history, we drew strength from unity. In hard times, our people, the mahalla, stood shoulder to shoulder and overcame difficulties. Families lived by helping one another; neighbors supported neighbors. We must always remain faithful to these unique values and raise our young generation in this spirit.
Of course, the presence of diverse opinions and viewpoints is natural. This is a primary requirement of democracy.
However, regardless of nationality, language, or faith, there is a great idea that unites our 38-million-strong nation. And that is the interests of the Motherland, the interests of our people.
The role and influence of the mahalla system in achieving this great goal are invaluable. Because when there is peace and harmony in the mahalla, our society will be peaceful and united. If the mahalla develops, the entire country will grow
, - said the President.
Taking all this into consideration, the Head of State proposed to declare 2026 as the “Year of Mahalla Development and Social Prosperity” in our country.
The people gathered in the hall warmly supported this initiative.
The program of the new year will address such pressing issues as transforming more than 9 thousand mahallas in our country into centers of kindness, solidarity, justice, and education.
-
We are entering a decisive stage in building the New Uzbekistan. Our work in this direction requires deep transformation in every sphere and sector.
Our goal is clear: in the coming years, to join the ranks of upper-middle-income countries.
From the Ferghana Valley to the Aral Sea region, from the Zarafshan Valley to Kashkadarya and Surkhandarya, from Tashkent to Jizzakh and Sirdarya – no matter which region of our country a citizen lives in, starting today, they should feel the results of reforms more tangibly in their daily lives.
Therefore, the upcoming 2026 will be a year of fundamental transformations in the development of public administration, the judicial and legal system, economic sectors, education, science, healthcare, culture, sports, and ecology – in all spheres
, - mentioned the President.
The Head of State separately elaborated on the key priority areas for 2026.
The first priority – further improvement of mahalla infrastructure, giving them the appearance of the New Uzbekistan.
The work on comprehensive development of territories and their improvement will continue.
Starting next year, a comprehensive approach to mahalla development will be implemented. New reforms in urbanization and sustainable development of the cities will begin.
The policy of supporting entrepreneurship will continue: in 2026  the main tax rates will remain unchanged, over 10 trillion soums will be allocated to projects for the development of entrepreneurial infrastructure. To develop small and medium-sized businesses 140 trillion soum in resources will be provided, of this amount, 43 trillion soum will be directed to support women’s and youth entrepreneurship.
The second priority is to transition the economy to a technological and innovative development model.
It was noted that from now on, every dollar of investment must primarily serve to transferring advanced technologies, producing high value-added products with specific foreign markets, increasing the efficiency of energy, water, land, and other natural resources, training local specialists to work with new technologies and boosting labor productivity.
An industrial development program aimed at transitioning to a new technological level and expanding the value-added chain will be launched. In 2026, 782 new industrial and infrastructure projects will be launched with a total value of $52 billion. Next year alone, 228 new large-scale production facilities will be launched, amounting to $14 billion.
Economic growth is projected at 6.6%, with GDP reaching $167 billion.
Enterprises that produce high-tech, innovation-based products will be encouraged. Income earned by the enterprise’s specialists from research and development activities will be exempt from taxation.
Next year, in Tashkent, Bukhara, Fergana, and Tashkent regions, four data centers, two supercomputers, and artificial intelligence laboratories in 15 universities will be established. This will enable the implementation of more than 100 AI projects in key areas such as healthcare, transport, agriculture, geology, banking and finance, and public safety.
-
Today, I want to share another important piece of news. For the first time in the history of independent Uzbekistan, we have begun work to launch a satellite into space and send the first Uzbek astronaut who is a citizen of our country
, - stated the President.
The third priority area — stimulating demand in the domestic market.
Over the past nine years, a favorable business environment was created and the volume and assortment of goods and services was increased. Due to provision of no less than 1 billion dollars in affordable loans annually to low-income families, the inflation has been reduced to a “single-digit” level, the purchasing power of the population has doubled.
Based on the population’s needs, in 2026, 23 trillion soums will be allocated for housing mortgages, which generate the highest demand in the economy. To partially compensate for the down payment and interest payments when purchasing housing, a subsidy of 2,7 trillion soums will be provided. In addition, the amount of concessional mortgage credit per apartment will be increased by 15 percent.
To stimulate demand for services in 2026, 85 trillion soums in loans and 9 trillion soums in subsidies will be allocated to the sector. In particular, 7 trillion soums will be allocated from the budget for educational services.
An ambitious goal was set: to double the number of foreign tourists and increase the volume of tourism services to $20 billion over the next five years. In pursuing this goal, a special emphasis is placed on the development of tourism infrastructure.
The increased inflow of tourists requires a doubling of passenger transportation in aviation and on railways. Therefore, in 2026, the number of aircraft in the fleet will be increased to 120.
A five-year program for the development of domestic railway infrastructure will be adopted. To connect cities with high-speed trains, starting in 2026, construction of an additional 500 kilometers of railway will begin. A five-year program will be implemented on the improvement of highways’ quality and further enhancement of transit potential.
Fourth priority area – development of professions and the creation of a new labor market architecture.
Currently, under the influence of new technologies, digitalization, and artificial intelligence, the quantity, structure, and content of jobs are changing radically worldwide. Over the next five years, 30 percent of existing professions will be fully automated, and 50 percent will require the acquisition of new skills.
-
Now, the labor market in our country must operate on a completely new architecture — as a unified mechanism integrating profession, qualifications, technology, and education
, - said the President.
Starting in 2026, at least 100 technical colleges will be fully renovated and equipped to meet technological requirements and the needs of in-demand professions. The number of technical colleges implementing advanced educational programs from countries such as Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, China, Korea and other countries will reach 100.
In 2026, Innovative Vocational Skills Colleges and “City of Professions” programs will be launched in 7 regions, and in 2027, in the remaining regions.
To develop vocational education in the medical system, training of nurses according to international standards of the British company Pearson has begun in one technical college in each region. Now, these technical colleges will implement educational programs from Germany, Switzerland, the USA, Japan and other countries.
On this basis, a nursing workforce will be formed that meets international standards and is proficient in foreign languages.
Fifth priority area – ensuring ecological balance, developing green energy, and the rational use of water resources.
A credit line of $100 million will be opened for large enterprises to install filters, treatment facilities, and emission monitoring stations for harmful substances in the atmosphere.
It was noted that traffic congestion in the cities not only complicates daily life but also causes serious environmental damage. Therefore, based on global experience, an environmental sticker system will be introduced according to the level of harmful emissions of vehicles.
Cars with high emission levels will have restricted access to the capital, regional centers, and major cities. To replace such vehicles with new ones or to install filters, the government will provide support measures.
Those who replace an old vehicle will receive partial compensation for auto loan interest. Drivers willing to install filters and reduce harmful emissions will be provided with a subsidy to cover part of the costs.
The development of public transport in Tashkent and major cities will be a priority task.
A five-year program will be carried out to increase the number of environmentally friendly vehicles. Auto loans will be provided at 12% for domestic electric vehicles and 16% for foreign electric vehicles.
To organize electric vehicle charging stations, entrepreneurs will receive concessional loans at 10%, and an opportunity to purchase land plots at auctions at half the market price. The difference in the cost of 1 kWh above 300 soums will be compensated from the state budget at the electric stations. Citizens providing taxi services using electric vehicles will also receive a number of benefits.
To prevent dust and sandstorms, in Surkhandarya, a green zone of 10 thousand hectares will be created, in Syrdarya – an 84-kilometer green wall will be built.
In Karakalpakstan, Khorezm, Bukhara, and Navoi, a total of 250 thousand hectares of trees and shrubs will be planted, including 115 thousand hectares on the dried Aral Sea bed. Each region will have botanical and dendrological gardens, as well as 20 shaded walking alleys.
In total, 1,9 trillion soums will be allocated to the environmental sector in 2026.
Additionally, 3,3 trillion soums will be allocated in 2026 for the activities related to the implementation of water-saving technologies.
Moreover, 1,300 km of major main canals will be concreted, allowing the saving of 500 million cubic meters of water per year. In addition, a separate program will be adopted to convert open drains and collectors into a closed system. Large-scale projects will also be launched to convert canals into closed systems.
Within the framework of a major program worth $160 million in Tashkent, a 150-kilometer closed drainage system will be constructed, and 197 kilometers of canals and collectors will be repaired, 63 kilometers of new canals will be built, creating a cool microclimate in the city.
Sixth priority area – continuing reforms in modern public administration and a fair judicial system.
First of all, starting in 2026, the “Electronic Government” platform will be completely updated.
Over one thousand of government services, more than 5 thousand functions and responsibilities, 240 databases and information systems, over 100 thousand responsibilities of civil servants in mahallas, districts, regions and republic will be integrated into a single digital platform.
-
Most importantly: we will create an ecosystem for providing government services without human intervention, eliminating corruption and excessive bureaucracy. We will develop a system for delivering government services in a proactive and integrated manner
, - said the President.
From now on, cases of direct government procurement of goods, works, and services will be determined only by law.
Within the framework of constitutional reforms, the positions of regional hokims and chairpersons of local kengash were separated. Now, this system will be implemented from 2026, in 208 districts and cities.
The President emphasized the role of civil society institutions in ensuring the effectiveness of reforms. Therefore, the policy of supporting them will be consistently continued in the future. Specifically, a five-year strategy for the development of civil society will be developed.
-
I repeat: during the period of large-scale reforms in our country, we will never abandon the policy of openness. Ensuring freedom of speech and the press remains our priority
, - announced the President.
The efforts to bring the judicial and legal system closer to the people will be continued.
It was emphasized that the role and participation of the society in the administration of justice will be expanded. The “jury of representatives” institution will be gradually implemented – a mechanism, which has shown positive results in countries with the English legal system.
The fight against drug-related crimes will be transformed into a national movement, a zero-tolerance environment will be created for this evil in society.
The task has been set to create an effective system for preventing violence against women and children, mobilizing all state bodies and the general public to put an end to such negative phenomena.
-
Corruption is a grave threat that impedes state development, undermines the rule of law and justice, and weakens public trust. Allowing corruption is tantamount to betraying our reforms!
In the fight against this scourge, we declare a “state of emergency” on corruption in 2026
, - stated the President.
In all government bodies, a deputy responsible for compliance and internal anti-corruption control will be appointed. Additionally, the role of a representative from the Accounts Chamber will be established.
Personal accountability for every soum of state funds and resources will be strengthened.
In the context of increased geopolitical and economic challenge, the work on strengthening equal and constructive relations with all countries and pursuing a balanced and open foreign policy, will be continued. Cooperation with prestigious international and regional organizations, economic institutions will be elevated to a new level.
-
The significant results achieved and the new priorities require a revision of the “Uzbekistan – 2030” Strategy. This document, concerning the development of our country over the next five years, will be refined based on broad public discussion and the opinions of our citizens
, - mentioned the President.
It was noted that next year the significant dates in the social and cultural life will be widely celebrated. In particular, the 35th anniversary of our Motherland’s independence will be celebrated as a major holiday. The necessity was noted to begin preparing for the momentous anniversaries of Amir Temur and Alisher Navoi.
-
Today, history itself, life itself places a great responsibility upon us.
Our beloved Homeland is becoming a country where people live and work on new political, legal, social, and spiritual foundations, where people think independently, are free, and liberated.
If we remain united, acting as one people, one nation, we will undoubtedly achieve our grand goals! I believe in the incomparable strength and potential of Uzbekistan, in the will and determination of our dear youth!
– said the President concluding his address.

President of Uzbekistan proposes new initiatives for developing cooperation between Central Asia and Japan
20.12.2025
On 20 December, President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev took part in the first summit of the “Central Asia + Japan” Dialogue in Tokyo.
The event, chaired by Prime Minister of Japan Sanae Takaichi, was also attended by President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, President of the Kyrgyz Republic Sadyr Japarov, President of the Republic of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon, and President of Turkmenistan Serdar Berdimuhamedov.
In line with the agenda, prospects for expanding mutually beneficial cooperation between the Central Asian states and Japan in key priority areas were reviewed, including the green economy and sustainable development, strengthening connectivity and regional interaction, and human resource development.
In his speech, the Head of our state noted that more than 20 years ago it was Japan that initiated the first dialogue in the “Central Asia Plus” format. A solid foundation for the development of multifaceted cooperation between Central Asia and Japan is formed by deep historical ties dating back to the times of the Great Silk Road, as well as the similarity of traditions and customs, spiritual, cultural, and family values.
–
We highly appreciate that throughout the entire period since the countries of Central Asia gained independence, Japan has acted as our reliable partner and has made a significant contribution to the socio-economic development of the region, the modernization of infrastructure, the industrial and energy base, and the strengthening of scientific, educational, and human resource potential. Therefore, the Central Asian states are interested in expanding and more active presence of Japan in the region
, – stated Shavkat Mirziyoyev.
The region’s rich natural resources, its location at the crossroads of global transport, trade, and energy routes, the dynamic economic growth of the Central Asian countries, and the active processes of rapprochement and integration taking place here create favorable conditions for cooperation with Japan.
–
I am confident that through joint efforts we will reach new heights. As a Japanese proverb says, “if the forces are united, the mountains can be moved,”
- noted the leader of Uzbekistan.
Turning to the items on the summit agenda, the President of our country presented his vision for the development of cooperation in the “Central Asia + Japan” format.
First of all, it was proposed to hold summits at the level of heads of state once every two years, which would give an additional strong impetus to cooperation. Readiness was expressed to host one of these future meetings in Uzbekistan.
Japan’s initiative to establish a new permanent mechanism in the field of justice and law, as well as to organize the first meeting of ministers of justice in Tokyo next year, was supported.
The Head of State advocated the development of a “Central Asia – Japan 2040” Cooperation Strategy, including specific programs and projects to promote the sustainable development of the countries of the region and their deeper integration into global economic processes.
The relevance of establishing an Expert Forum with the participation of leading analytical institutions to develop new ideas and proposals and to form a comprehensive cooperation agenda was noted. It was proposed to hold the first meeting of the Forum next year in Tashkent.
The Leader of Uzbekistan welcomed the expansion of support by Japanese financial institutions for trade, economic, and investment projects in Central Asia.
-
I am confident that by combining the rich natural and human resources of Central Asia with Japan’s industrial and technological potential, we will be able to achieve an effect of synergy,
- stated Shavkat Mirziyoyev.
In this regard, it was proposed to establish an Investment Fund for the Development of Infrastructure and Industry of Central Asia, launching on its basis a “Quality Infrastructure” Program, as well as to create a Central Asian network of Japanese technoparks – a regional platform for industrial cooperation, localization, and technology transfer.
Taking into account the growing importance of digital transformation in ensuring economic growth and sustainability, the President of Uzbekistan advocated the establishment of a “Central Asia – Japan” Digital Hub – a multilateral cooperation platform in the fields of digital solutions, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, cybersecurity, and innovation economy.
Interest was expressed in attracting Japanese investment, technologies, and expert support for projects to develop high-speed railways and highways, digitalize transport corridors, and construct airports and logistics centers.
Within the framework of cooperation in the field of green energy, the importance of implementing joint projects to introduce cogeneration technologies, reduce losses, and capture and utilize carbon dioxide was emphasized. It was proposed to establish a Regional Training Center for Renewable Energy Specialists in Tashkent.
In the ecological sphere, the Head of State advocated the launch of a joint Program to improve air quality in Central Asia, the adoption of a joint Action Plan on combating climate change, as well as the establishment, within the framework of the Dialogue, of a new format of meetings of heads of environmental authorities.
Taking into account Japan’s extensive experience in the field of seismic safety, it was proposed to implement a joint Program for assessing and enhancing seismic resilience in the region and to open a Regional Advanced Training Center in Tashkent to train engineers, architects, and emergency response services in accordance with Japanese standards and protocols.
In order to further expand cooperation in the cultural and humanitarian sphere, it was proposed to hold next year in Uzbekistan the first Meeting of Ministers of Education in the “Central Asia + Japan” format and a Forum of Rectors of leading universities, as well as to adopt a Regional Network Youth Development Program aimed at building long-term ties among youth communities.
Touching upon issues of international politics and ensuring regional security, the leader of our country noted that the countries of the region and Japan are united in their aspiration to see Afghanistan peaceful, stable, and oriented toward constructive development.
High appreciation was given to Japan’s consistent position, which for many years has remained among the leading donors and partners in supporting the Afghan people.
Concluding his speech, the President of Uzbekistan expressed support for the decisions on all items of the agenda.
Other leaders also addressed the summit. Following the event, the Tokyo Declaration was adopted.

President of Uzbekistan advocates for expanding practical cooperation with Japanese businesses
19.12.2025
As part of the business program of his official visit to Japan, President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev held a meeting with the heads of leading companies, financial institutions, and business associations of the country.
The event was attended by Japan’s Minister of economy, trade and industry Ryosei Akazawa, as well as top managers of major corporations and companies, financial institutions, and banks including Sojitz, Sumitomo, Toyota, ITOCHU, Mitsubishi, Marubeni, Daito Trust Construction, NEC, SBI Holdings, Ajinomoto, Japan Tobacco, Hitachi, Mitsui, Balcom, NEC, Eurus Energy, Chubu Electric Power, Shikoku Electric, Shimizu, Hankyu Travel International, Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC), Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI), Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), Japan Association for Trade with Russia and NIS (ROTOBO), Norinchukin Bank, SBI Shinsei, the Japan Association of Travel Agents, and others.
Addressing the meeting participants, the Head of our state noted that such representative participation from Japanese businesses is a clear testament to the high level of mutual trust and the parties' sustained interest in further development of the economic partnership.
It should be highlighted that in recent years, cooperation between Uzbekistan and Japan has reached a new level.
Whereas previously Japanese companies were primarily involved in contracting projects, today they are actively investing in the country's economy, establishing joint ventures, participating in management, transferring technologies, and contributing to the training of national personnel.
As a result of these qualitative changes, Japan has become one of Uzbekistan's key economic and technological partners.
The positive dynamic is also reflected in trade and economic indicators. Over the past 8 years, trade turnover has doubled, while the number of Japanese enterprises operating in Uzbekistan has increased tenfold.
Strong cooperation has been established in energy, healthcare, geology, information technology, infrastructure, and other priority areas.
During the meeting, the President focused on the key goals of the country's socioeconomic development.
It was noted that Uzbekistan's gross domestic product has doubled over the past 8 years. By 2030, the goal has been set to elevate the country to the category of upper-middle-income countries.
The Head of State invited Japanese businesses to actively participate in the modernization of Uzbekistan's economy, aimed at accelerating industrialization, introducing advanced technologies, increasing productivity, and expanding export opportunities.
In this context, priority areas for further cooperation with Japanese business circles were identified.
These include ensuring energy stability and the "green" transition, including the development of renewable energy sources and storage systems, as well as reducing the carbon intensity of the economy.
Particular attention was paid to the deep processing of critical minerals to form a complete value-added chain.
Promising areas also include the development of mechanical engineering and industrial equipment, and the formation of a modern, high-tech industrial economy.
A special emphasis was placed on the development of information technologies, including implementing programs in artificial intelligence and digitalization.
Another important area is the creation of modern special economic zones, designed to become centers for high-tech and export-oriented production, as well as industrial cooperation through the automation of production processes and the implementation of digital management systems.
With the assistance of JICA, a project is being prepared to create a special economic zone based on the Japanese model and standards.
In conclusion, the Head of our state emphasized that Uzbekistan views Japan not only as an investor but also as a strategic partner in building the industry of the future.
In turn, representatives of Japanese business circles expressed their commitment to expanding their presence in Uzbekistan and announced plans to participate in the implementation of joint projects in priority areas.
Following the meeting, a ceremony for the exchange of bilateral agreements was held in the presence of President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev and Minister Ryosei Akazawa.

12.12.2025
On December 12, President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev participated in an International Forum in Ashgabat dedicated to the 30th anniversary of the proclamation of Turkmenistan's permanent neutrality, the International Day of Neutrality, and the declaration of 2025 as the "International Year of Peace and Trust".
The event, chaired by President of Turkmenistan Serdar Berdimuhamedov, was attended by President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, President of the Republic of Türkiye Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President of the Islamic Republic of Iran Masoud Pezeshkian, President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, President of the Kyrgyz Republic Sadyr Japarov, President of the Republic of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon, as well as leaders of other states, heads of governments, international and regional organizations.
In his address, the President of Uzbekistan sincerely congratulated the Turkmen side on the 30th anniversary of its permanent Neutrality, emphasizing that this significant date embodies Turkmenistan's unwavering commitment to developing peaceful, trusting, friendly, as well as mutually beneficial relations with all countries of the world.
-
Turkmenistan's neutrality, which has become part of the modern identity of the Turkmen people, is based on its deep historical traditions, cultural and spiritual values, and such noble qualities inherent to it as generosity, tolerance, and good-neighborliness
, -  stated Shavkat Mirziyoyev.
In this regard, the initiative of Turkmenistan to establish a University of Peace and Neutrality jointly with the United Nations, was supported.
The Head of our state noted that for the New Uzbekistan, openness to the world, mutual respect, and a commitment to dialogue are fundamental values. One of such testaments to this is the Samarkand Solidarity Initiative for Common Security and Prosperity, put forward by Uzbekistan, which aims to engage in dialogue all those who strive for peace, harmony, and sustainable development.
Moreover, Uzbekistan intends to define the main priorities of its upcoming chairmanship of the Non-Aligned Movement as promoting a global movement in support of a culture of peace and non-violence, strengthening trust in relations between states through political dialogue, and fostering a global atmosphere of tolerance, mutual understanding, and solidarity.

The President of our country noted the growing relevance of maintaining a universal commitment to the principles of peacefulness and mediation in the current conditions of global tension and declining trust between states. Therefore Uzbekistan supported Turkmenistan's proposal to declare 2025 the International Year of Peace and Trust, acting as co-sponsor the relevant resolution of the UN General Assembly.
He also highlighted that the principles of mutual trust, respect, and solidarity form the basis of the policy to transform Central Asia into a region of peace, cooperation, and good-neighborliness.
-
The seventh Consultative Meeting of the Heads of state of the region that took place last month in Tashkent, once again demonstrated our readiness to strengthen solidarity, take joint action to ensure peace and stability in the region, and expand multifaceted economic cooperation

In this context, the Head of our state underscored the special role of Turkmenistan's constructive and peaceful policy in ensuring stability and development in Central Asia.
He expressed confidence that Turkmenistan's international initiatives and proposals, based on the noble ideas of peace and trust, will be reflected in the agenda of Ashgabat's chairmanship of the Consultative Meetings of the Heads of State of the region.
Highlighting the importance of humanitarian cooperation in strengthening collaboration based on mutual respect, trust, and solidarity, the Leader of Uzbekistan proposed organizing the "Dialogue of Cultures" international humanitarian forum in Tashkent next year and launching the "Youth for Peace and Trust" regional program.

The President reviews the presentation of ongoing projects in New Tashkent
30.12.2025
The Head of State visited the Directorate for the Construction of New Tashkent and reviewed a presentation on ongoing and prospective construction projects in the city.
The first stone in the foundation of this city was laid in 2023. A total of 19,700 hectares of land in the Yukorichirchik and Urtachirchik districts were allocated for the project. The concept was developed by the British company Cross Works. Currently, more than 100 projects of various scales are being actively implemented here. Each initiative is based on international standards and modern trends in urban planning.
The outlines of large-scale structures are gradually beginning to emerge. By the end of 2025, the area of work in the new city reached 3 million square meters.
The construction of several residential complexes has entered its final stage. Work on infrastructure facilities is progressing dynamically.
In the first stage, construction work will cover 6,000 hectares of land. As a result, it is planned to create a modern infrastructure for 600,000 people to live and work. Upon completion of the project, New Tashkent will become a huge metropolis designed for 2 million people.
Construction on this scale requires long-term and sustainable infrastructure. Currently, large underground utilities are being built on the site.
Single- and double-section collectors are being laid to ensure that all engineering networks – heat supply, water supply, electricity supply, and telecommunications – are located underground.
Particular attention is being paid to the organization of modern transport links. It has been noted that the construction of tunnels and underground parking lots is of great importance for the city's transport system in the future.
A ten-kilometer coastal park is being created on the territory. One million shrubs and tree seedlings have been planted.
The Head of our state noted that “green” principles should play an important role in urban planning. Responsible officials have been given additional instructions to coordinate the movement of the metro and electric buses, as well as to create safe and barrier-free routes for pedestrians and cyclists.
Modern administrative buildings will be constructed on the territory of the new city for more than 60 government agencies. A number of ministries and agencies have already begun working in temporary complexes.
Investor activity is high. Investment agreements worth $2 billion have been signed for 24 commercial lots sold at auction. These funds will be used to build hotels, restaurants, service complexes, and buildings with unique architecture.
At the current stage of construction, 10,000 people are employed. Once the project is fully implemented, hundreds of thousands of high-paying permanent jobs based on innovative technologies are expected to be created.
The President of our country was presented with information about tourist facilities, service and entertainment complexes under construction in New Tashkent, as well as major investment and infrastructure projects planned in other regions of the country.
The Head of State emphasized that every initiative should be based on scientific achievements, reflect local color, and, most importantly, serve the interests of the people.

Progress on road and transport infrastructure construction reported
30.12.2025
Continuing his visit to New Tashkent, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev inspected the construction of a new bridge across the Chirchik river and a parking lot combined with a metro station.
These projects, aimed at strengthening transport links between the capital and New Tashkent, effectively managing traffic flow, and creating a convenient environment for the movement of the population, are of great importance for the development of urban infrastructure.
The new bridge will connect Tashkent and New Tashkent. Its capacity will be 40-50 thousand cars per day. Construction work on the first phase of the project began at the end of this year.
Particular attention is being paid to environmental protection as part of the project. It is planned to landscape the coastal areas, install energy-efficient lighting systems, and build pedestrian and bicycle paths. There are also plans to lay a two-lane tram line across the bridge.
The project for the future 21-kilometer metro line, which will connect New Tashkent with the city of Tashkent, includes nine modern stations. It will be able to serve 230 thousand passengers daily. The line will be fully integrated with the existing metro network of the capital, forming a single and continuous transport system.
The Head of our state reviewed the progress of construction of one of the stations of the future line, which will be integrated with a 20 thousand square meter parking lot. The project clearly distinguishes between car, pedestrian, and public transport flows, with safety and functionality as priorities.
Currently, groundwork and concrete pouring are underway on the site. The complex is scheduled to be commissioned in 2027.
Emphasizing the strategic importance of the projects for New Tashkent, the President gave his recommendations on the high-quality and timely completion of construction work.

The President reviews the construction of educational and enlightenment institutions
30.12.2025
President Shavkat Mirziyoyev reviewed the construction progress of “New Uzbekistan” University and the National Library of Uzbekistan in New Tashkent.
Among the priority tasks in our country are the development of strategic sectors of the economy on a scientific basis, the expansion of innovation, and the production of high value-added products. This process is closely linked to the training of qualified personnel with modern knowledge and practical skills.
To this end, the “New Uzbekistan” University was established in accordance with the decree of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan dated June 23, 2021.
The new university complex in New Tashkent, with an initial cost of $200 million, will occupy an area of 50 hectares.
The project was developed in collaboration with Turkish specialists at the request of the New Tashkent Construction Directorate. The construction work is being carried out by the "Özgüven" company. The university complex is scheduled to be commissioned in 2027.
The complex will include five faculties for 10 thousand students, a rector's office, a library with more than a thousand seats, a museum, an exhibition hall, and multimedia rooms. A sports complex with one thousand seats, residential buildings with a capacity of 2 thousand people, a swimming pool, and dining halls will also be built for students and teachers.
Construction work is currently being carried out in three stages. The Head of our state paid special attention to the main parameters of the project, the infrastructure, and the conditions being created for the educational process. The importance of such modern educational institutions for the realization of the scientific and intellectual potential of young people was emphasized separately.
-
The creative work carried out at this university, as well as the educational programs implemented here, should serve as a model for other higher education institutions
, - emphasized the Head of our state.
Responsible persons have been instructed to gradually renovate and equip other universities, as well as to widely introduce advanced technologies into the educational process.
Work is also underway on the construction of a new building for the National Library of Uzbekistan on a site covering approximately 4 hectares. The building has been designed to combine traditional national architecture with modern architectural solutions.
The total area of the four-story building is over 30 thousand square meters and will be able to serve 1,420 readers at the same time. Special high-tech rooms will be created for storage, accounting, security, and sterilization of library collections.
The complex will be multifunctional and will provide online access to the electronic databases of major international and national libraries. A special environment for reading and research will be created for citizens with visual impairments. A 300-seat café, a gallery, sports grounds, and recreation areas will also be built for visitors.
The President emphasized that this library will occupy an important place among the educational and enlightenment centers being created in New Tashkent and will become a solid foundation for the intellectual development of the younger generation. It was noted that a state that invests in science and education will have high economic potential.
The importance of in-depth mastery of information technology and international standards by employees for the effective use of the capabilities of a modern library was emphasized.

The first energy capacities of New Tashkent are developing
30.12.2025
President Shavkat Mirziyoyev got acquainted with the energy facilities constructed on the territory of New Tashkent.
The modern trigeneration technology allows to simultaneously ensure the city with the heating and cooling, spending twice less energy than traditional sources. Production processes in traditional heating plants or cooling systems are carried out separately. During trigeneration all of them are integrated into one single technological chain.
Currently construction of main buildings and station facilities based on such technologies is being carried out in New Tashkent. The necessary equipment within the project fully complies with international energy efficiency requirements.
The project’s first phase envisions creation of capacities of 75 megawatt of heating, 100 megawatt of cooling. Generation of 17 megawatt of electricity will also be organized.
The first substation of New Tashkent has the capacity of 100 megawatt, which is enough for ensuring the initial needs of the cities. The project is being implemented based on private-public partnership with the participation of Chinese company “Haocheng Industry Group Limited”.
It is noteworthy that this is the first enclosed substation in Uzbekistan.
Such facilities have a number of advantages over traditional open substations. First of all, they are designed to fit into the urban environment and are located where they do not disrupt the architectural appearance. In addition, the noise level at such substations is half that of traditional ones. Moreover, they take up three times less space than open-type facilities. This is a huge advantage for a city with a complex engineering concept, such as New Tashkent, which is currently under construction.
During his tour of these facilities, the President particularly emphasized their technical capabilities, economic efficiency, and strategic importance for New Tashkent, and gave recommendations on organizing work even more efficiently and implementing the next stages quickly and with high quality.

The construction progress of the new residential complex reviewed
30.12.2025
President Shavkat Mirziyoyev visited the construction site of the “Sharq bahori” residential complex in New Tashkent.
As was mentioned by the Head of our state in his Address to the Oliy Majlis and the people, this year 8,1 million square meters of multi-apartment buildings were constructed and are being launched. Overall, over the past nine years 210 million square meters of residential and non-residential facilities have been commissioned.
The major residential construction is also ongoing in New Tashkent. At the first stage it’s planned to develop a modern infrastructure for 600 thousand residents. By the final completion of the project, New Tashkent will be transformed into a major metropolis capable of accommodating 2 million people.
The first step in ensuring the housing needs will become “Sharq bahori” complex. This is one of the largest projects of residential construction in our region – the territory covering 95 hectares will house multi-story buildings for almost 15 thousand apartments.
Currently over 1 million 800 thousand square meters of construction works have been completed. Modern materials of “A+” energy efficiency category are being used.
It’s also planned to develop a green zone for planting over 15 thousand trees and shrubs on the territory. Independent heating and cooling systems will be installed, the roofs will be fully covered with solar panels.
Underground parking will be organized for parking personal vehicles of residents. A park, metro station, administrative buildings and public facilities will be organized within 5-10 minute distance from the complex.
While visiting one of the completed apartments and getting acquainted with the conditions, the President underlined that New Tashkent should become a standard and a workshop for the whole country in the construction of convenient housing for the population.

Shavkat Mirziyoyev was born on July 24, 1957, in Zaamin District of Jizzakh Region to a family of doctors. He is Uzbek by nationality and has higher education. In 1981, he graduated from the Tashkent Institute of Engineers of Irrigation and Mechanization of Agriculture with a degree in mechanical engineering. He holds a Ph.D. in Technical Sciences and is an Associate Professor.
Shavkat Mirziyoyev started his career in 1981 at the Tashkent Institute of Engineers of Irrigation and Mechanization of Agriculture, where he served as a junior research fellow, senior lecturer, associate professor, and the vice rector for academic affairs.
In 1990, he was elected as a deputy of the Supreme Council of the Republic. He served as the Chairman of the Credentials Committee. In 1992, Shavkat Mirziyoyev was appointed as the khokim (governor) of Mirzo Ulugbek District in the city of Tashkent. From 1996 to 2001, he served as the khokim of Jizzakh Region and from 2001 to 2003, he was the khokim of Samarkand Region. He made a significant contribution to the socio-economic development of the aforementioned district and regions.
While working in the executive branch and concurrently serving as the deputy of the Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan from 1995 to 2003, he actively and fruitfully participated in the elaboration and adoption of important legislative acts concerning the political and socio-economic development of the country and implementation of democratic reforms.
Shavkat Mirziyoyev was appointed as the Prime Minister of the Republic of Uzbekistan in 2003 and subsequently re-approved three times (in 2005, 2010, and 2015) in his post by both Chambers of the Oliy Majlis.
From the early years of Uzbekistan’s independence, Shavkat Mirziyoyev earned high trust from the first President of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov by selflessly working as his colleague and close associate.
As the head of the government, he has shown tremendous abilities and outstanding leadership in the implementation of wide-ranging socio-economic reforms, modernization, and improvement of the country, realization of major and unique projects, development and protection of private property, radical increase in the share of small businesses and private enterprise in the economy, and consolidation of their legal security.
In his activities, Shavkat Mirziyoyev attached special significance to economic development on an industrial basis, improving the country's exporting potential, fundamentally transforming the agricultural sector, especially through the extensive advancement of farming enterprises, deep processing of agricultural products, providing food security for the nation, and guaranteeing the supply of goods to the population at reasonable prices.
In order to drastically uplift the living and working conditions of people, Shavkat Mirziyoyev had taken effective measures for large-scale construction and improvement works in all regions of the country. This includes improving the quality of public services, integrated development of cities and districts, and even remote rural areas.
In addition to the socio-economic dimension, Mirziyoyev placed a significant emphasis on education, science, and healthcare as priority areas in line with the modern requirements, the need for creating necessary conditions for forming a healthy and comprehensively advanced younger generation, and protecting motherhood and childhood.
He has paid much attention to further enhancing the credibility of the unique institution of self-government – makhalla and other social organizations, consistent consolidation of their role in the community through broad involvement in the process of democratic reforms, as well as the preservation and enrichment of national spiritual values.
Along with this, in addressing economic and social issues, Shavkat Mirziyoyev directly supervised the efforts to build up comprehensive, mutually beneficial cooperation with other countries, international organizations, and financial institutions. He also prioritized important agreements that serve the national interests and economic development of the country.
On September 8, 2016, based on a joint resolution of the Legislative Chamber (Lower House) and Senate of the Oliy Majlis (parliament) of Uzbekistan adopted at a joint session, Prime Minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev was temporarily assigned the duties and powers of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan.
On October 19, 2016, the Movement of Entrepreneurs and Businessmen - Liberal-Democratic Party of Uzbekistan (UzLiDeP) nominated Shavkat Mirziyoyev as their candidate for the presidential elections during its Eighth Convention in Tashkent.
Shavkat Mirziyoyev was elected President of the Republic of Uzbekistan with 88.61 percent of the vote based on the results of the presidential elections that took place on December 4, 2016. He officially assumed the post of President of the Republic of Uzbekistan on December 14, 2016.
On October 24, 2021 President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has been re-elected for a second five-year term, winning 80.1% votes.

In recognition of his many years of productive work in government and management, enormous contribution to the development of the country, and improvement of the people’s welfare, Shavkat Mirziyoyev was awarded the Order “Mekhnat Shukhrati” (‘Glory of Labor’) and “Fidokorona Khizmatlari Uchun” (‘For Selfless Service’).

«Бир макон, бир йўл» халқаро форуми бошланди
26.04.2019
Пекин шаҳрида «Бир макон, бир йўл» иккинчи халқаро форуми расман очилди.
Маросимда Ўзбекистон Республикаси Президенти Шавкат Мирзиёев иштирок этди.
Анжуманни Хитой Халқ Республикаси Раиси Си Цзиньпин очиб, унда иштирок этаётган барча делегациялар раҳбарлари, кўп сонли эксперт ва таҳлилий доиралар вакилларига миннатдорлик билдирди.
Хитой Раиси БМТ, ШҲТ, Европа Иттифоқи, Евроосиё иқтисодий иттифоқи каби халқаро ва минтақавий тузилмалар ҳамкорлигида амалга оширилаётган «Бир макон, бир йўл» лойиҳаси турли мамлакатларнинг миллий тараққиёт стратегиясига мос келишини, шу жиҳатдан бутун дунёда иқтисодий ривожланишга кенг йўл очишини таъкидлади.
Форумнинг очилишида халқаро савдо ва инвестиция алоқаларини мустаҳкамлаш, янги транспорт ва логистика йўлаклари яратилишини рағбатлантириш бўйича амалга ошириладиган лойиҳалар хусусида сўз юритилди. Ушбу лойиҳада иштирок этаётган мамлакатлар сафи кенгайиб бораётгани, бу дунёда барқарор ривожланишга интилиш кучаяётганини ифода этиши таъкидланди.
Маълумки, «Бир макон, бир йўл» халқаро форуми илк бор 2017 йилда ўтказилган. Хитой илгари сурган мазкур ташаббус икки йўналиш - қуруқлик ва денгиз йўлларини ривожлантириш ва ўзаро боғлаш орқали давлатлараро ҳамкорлик механизмларини мустаҳкамлашга қаратилган. Ҳозирда у Осиё, Европа ва Африкадаги 65 мамлакатни қамраб олган. Келгусида унга бошқа давлатлар ҳам қўшилиши натижасида глобал иқтисодий маконга айланади.
Бу галги форумда минтақавий иқтисодий ҳамкорликни янада мустаҳкамлаш, узоқ муддатли тараққиётнинг янги манбаларини излаб топиш борасидаги шерикликни фаоллаштириш, “яшил” иқтисодиёт ва инновацияларни илгари суриш, устувор инфратузилмавий лойиҳаларни амалга ошириш масалаларига алоҳида эътибор қаратилади.
Форум икки кун давом этади. Унда Ўзбекистон Президентининг нутқ сўзлаши ҳам режалаштирилган.

«Bir makon, bir yo‘l» xalqaro forumi boshlandi
26.04.2019
Pekin shahrida «Bir makon, bir yo‘l» ikkinchi xalqaro forumi rasman ochildi.
Marosimda O‘zbekiston Respublikasi Prezidenti Shavkat Mirziyoyev ishtirok etdi.
Anjumanni Xitoy Xalq Respublikasi Raisi Si Szinpin ochib, unda ishtirok etayotgan barcha delegatsiyalar rahbarlari, ko‘p sonli ekspert va tahliliy doiralar vakillariga minnatdorlik bildirdi.
Xitoy Raisi BMT, ShHT, Yevropa Ittifoqi, Yevroosiyo iqtisodiy ittifoqi kabi xalqaro va mintaqaviy tuzilmalar hamkorligida amalga oshirilayotgan «Bir makon, bir yo‘l» loyihasi turli mamlakatlarning milliy taraqqiyot strategiyasiga mos kelishini, shu jihatdan butun dunyoda iqtisodiy rivojlanishga keng yo‘l ochishini ta’kidladi.
Forumning ochilishida xalqaro savdo va investitsiya aloqalarini mustahkamlash, yangi transport va logistika yo‘laklari yaratilishini rag‘batlantirish bo‘yicha amalga oshiriladigan loyihalar xususida so‘z yuritildi. Ushbu loyihada ishtirok etayotgan mamlakatlar safi kengayib borayotgani, bu dunyoda barqaror rivojlanishga intilish kuchayayotganini ifoda etishi ta’kidlandi.
Ma’lumki, «Bir makon, bir yo‘l» xalqaro forumi ilk bor 2017-yilda o‘tkazilgan. Xitoy ilgari surgan mazkur tashabbus ikki yo‘nalish - quruqlik va dengiz yo‘llarini rivojlantirish va o‘zaro bog‘lash orqali davlatlararo hamkorlik mexanizmlarini mustahkamlashga qaratilgan. Hozirda u Osiyo, Yevropa va Afrikadagi 65 mamlakatni qamrab olgan. Kelgusida unga boshqa davlatlar ham qo‘shilishi natijasida global iqtisodiy makonga aylanadi.
Bu galgi forumda mintaqaviy iqtisodiy hamkorlikni yanada mustahkamlash, uzoq muddatli taraqqiyotning yangi manbalarini izlab topish borasidagi sheriklikni faollashtirish, “yashil” iqtisodiyot va innovatsiyalarni ilgari surish, ustuvor infratuzilmaviy loyihalarni amalga oshirish masalalariga alohida e’tibor qaratiladi.
Forum ikki kun davom etadi. Unda O‘zbekiston Prezidentining nutq so‘zlashi ham rejalashtirilgan.

Председатель Китайской Народной Республики Си Цзиньпин, открывая форум, выразил благодарность главам всех участвующих в нем делегаций, многочисленным представителям экспертных и аналитических кругов.
Председатель Китая отметил, что проект "Один пояс, один путь", реализуемый совместно с такими международными и региональными структурами, как ООН, ШОС, Евросоюз, Евразийский экономических союз, соответствует стратегиям развития различных стран и потому открывает широкую дорогу для экономического прогресса во всем мире.
На открытии говорилось о проектах, которые будут реализованы для укрепления международной торговли и инвестиционных связей, стимулировать создание новых транспортных и логистических коридоров. Отмечалось, что число стран-участниц проекта растет, это свидетельствует об усиливающемся в мире стремлении к устойчивому развитию.
Как известно, международный форум "Один пояс, один путь" впервые состоялся в 2017 году.

В настоящее время проект охватывает 65 стран в Азии, Европе и Африке. В дальнейшем, в результате присоединения других стран, он превратится в глобальную экономическую платформу.
На нынешнем форуме основное внимание будет уделено вопросам дальнейшего углубления экономического сотрудничества, активизации взаимодействия в поиске новых источников долгосрочного роста, продвижения «зеленой» экономики и инноваций, реализации приоритетных инфраструктурных проектов.

Ўзбекистон Президенти Хитой билан кўп қиррали ҳамкорликни кенгайтириш бўйича ташаббусларни илгари сурди
17.06.2025
Ўзбекистон Республикаси Президенти Шавкат Мирзиёев 17 июнь куни Остона шаҳрида "Марказий Осиё - Хитой" иккинчи саммитида иштирок этди.
Қозоғистон Республикаси Президенти Қасим-Жомарт Тоқаев раислигида ўтган тадбирда Хитой Халқ Республикаси Раиси Си Цзиньпин, Қирғиз Республикаси Президенти Садир Жапаров, Тожикистон Республикаси Президенти Эмомали Раҳмон ва Туркманистон Президенти Сердар Бердимуҳамедов ҳам қатнашди.
Кун тартибига мувофиқ, Марказий Осиё мамлакатлари ва Хитой ўртасидаги ўзаро манфаатли ҳамкорликни устувор йўналишларда кенгайтириш истиқболлари, долзарб халқаро ва минтақавий масалалар кўриб чиқилди.
Ўзбекистон Президенти нутқининг аввалида ХХР Раиси Си Цзиньпиннинг Марказий Осиё давлатлари билан дўстлик ва ҳамкорликни мустаҳкамлаш, аниқ лойиҳа ва дастурларни амалга ошириш орқали минтақанинг барқарор тараққиётини қўллаб-қувватлашдаги ўрнини алоҳида таъкидлади.
2023 йилда Сиань шаҳрида ўтган биринчи саммитдан сўнг "Марказий Осиё - Хитой" форматидаги ҳамкорликда катта муваффақиятларга эришилгани мамнуният билан қайд этилди.
Хусусан, котибият ташкил этилди, вазирлар, экспертлар учрашувлари ва йиғилишларини ўтказиш механизмлари ишга туширилди, кенг кўламли ҳамкорликнинг шартномавий-ҳуқуқий базаси шакллантирилмоқда.
Марказий Осиё мамлакатларининг Хитой билан товар айирбошлаш ҳажми ортиб бормоқда, жорий йилда бу кўрсаткич 100 миллиард долларга етиши кутилмоқда.
– Бизнингча, бир томондан, ишонч, яхши қўшничилик ва шериклик маконига айланган Марказий Осиёнинг ўзидаги чуқур трансформация жараёнлари, бошқа томондан, Хитой раҳбариятининг қўшни давлатлар билан дўстона муносабатларни ривожлантириш ва “Белбоғ ва йўл” глобал концепциясини илгари суришга қатъий содиқлиги ушбу форматдаги ҳамкорликнинг ривожланишига имкон бермоқда,
- деди давлатимиз раҳбари.
Сўнг Ўзбекистон етакчиси минтақавий ҳамкорликни янада ривожлантириш бўйича ўз нуқтаи назарини баён қилди.
Аввало, бу галги учрашув халқаро вазият сезиларли даражада ёмонлашган бир шароитда ўтаётгани таъкидланди.
Рақобатнинг ортиши кескинликнинг зўрайишига, хавфсизлик ва барқарор тараққиётга янги хавф ва таҳдидлар пайдо бўлишига олиб келмоқда.
– Низоли халқаро масалалар ва зиддиятли муаммоларни ҳал қилиш учун куч ишлатиш воситаларидан фойдаланиш ўзини оқламайди ва бунга йўл қўйиб бўлмайди, деб ҳисоблаймиз,
- деди Президент.
- Барча низо ва зиддиятлар суверенитетни ҳурмат қилиш, халқаро ҳуқуқ меъёрлари ва Бирлашган Миллатлар Ташкилоти низоми асосида фақат дипломатик саъй-ҳаракатлар йўли билан – музокаралар столида ҳал этилиши шарт.
Шу муносабат билан саммит давомида минтақавий барқарорликни таъминлашга умумий ҳисса қўшадиган Абадий яхши қўшничилик, дўстлик ва ҳамкорлик тўғрисидаги шартнома қабул қилиниши тарихий аҳамиятга эга экани таъкидланди. Ушбу шартномани ривожлантириш мақсадида аниқ механизм ва лойиҳаларни киритган ҳолда Узоқ муддатли шериклик концепциясини ишлаб чиқиш таклиф этилди.
Ўзбекистон етакчиси таъкидлаганидек, Хитой билан савдо, инвестициявий ва технологик ҳамкорлик Марказий Осиёнинг барча мамлакатларини ижтимоий-иқтисодий ривожлантириш стратегияларини амалга оширишда кучли локомотив бўлиб хизмат қилмоқда.
Минтақа мамлакатларининг ўсиб бораётган салоҳияти ва Хитойнинг саноат соҳасидаги етакчилигини бирлаштириш билимлар билан алмашиш ва технологиялар трансферининг самарали механизмларига эга бўлган умумий кенг имкониятлар макони пайдо бўлишига олиб келиши мумкинлиги таъкидланди.
Янги иқтисодий шериклик дастурини тез фурсатда қабул қилиш ҳамда Бош вазир ўринбосарлари даражасида Савдо ва инвестициялар бўйича ҳудудлараро кенгашни таъсис этиш бу борадаги амалий қадам бўлади. Ўзбекистон томони кенгашнинг биринчи йиғилишини жорий йил охиригача ўтказишга тайёрлиги билдирилди.
Савдо алоқаларини рағбатлантириш мақсадида Ўзбекистон Президенти "Рақамли макон ва йўл" доирасида "Рақамли Ипак йўли" кўп томонлама савдо платформасини ташкил этиш ташаббусини илгари сурди.
Шунингдек, регламент ва стандартларни яқинлаштириш, экспорт маҳсулотларини Хитой талаблари асосида сертификатлаш учун Тошкент шаҳрида Саноатда стандартлаштириш ва сертификатлаштириш минтақавий марказини ташкил этиш зарурлиги таъкидланди.
Бизнес, етакчи илмий-тадқиқот институтлари ва муҳандислик марказларини жалб қилган ҳолда, технологиялар трансфери бўйича алоҳида "йўл харитаси"ни қабул қилиш таклифи билдирилди.
Ўзбекистон етакчиси иқтисодий салоҳиятни самарали рўёбга чиқариш учун саноат ва инфратузилмавий ўзаро боғлиқликни кучайтириш зарурлигига алоҳида тўхталди. Шу мақсадда "Марказий Осиё - Хитой" саноат ва инфратузилма макони" узоқ муддатли стратегиясини ишлаб чиқиш таклиф этилди.
Хитой инвестициялари, технологик ва илмий ечимларини жалб қилган ҳолда, ўзаро боғланган саноат кластерлари, технопарклар ва логистика хаблари тизимини яратиш шулар жумласидан.
Марказий Осиё мамлакатлари ва Хитой энергетика тизимларини ўзаро боғлаш, жумладан, юқори кучланишли электр узатиш линиясини барпо этиш мегалойиҳасини амалга ошириш масалалари ҳам диққат билан ўрганилиши лозим.
Минтақавий аҳамиятга молик йирик лойиҳаларни қўллаб-қувватлашга қодир бўлган самарали молиявий воситаларни жорий этиш масаласи алоҳида долзарблик касб этмоқда.
– Бугунги кунда амалда бўлган халқаро механизмлар, ҳеч шубҳасиз, муҳим роль ўйнамоқда, аммо минтақанинг инвестицияга бўлган талабини тўлиқ қоплай олмаяпти. Экспертларнинг хулосасига кўра, Марказий Осиёни инфратузилмавий ривожлантиришда капитал қўйилмалар тақчиллиги бир неча юз миллиард доллар деб баҳоланмоқда",
- деди Ўзбекистон етакчиси.
Шу муносабат билан инфратузилмавий ташаббусларни илгари суриш учун самарали платформа бўла оладиган "Марказий Осиё - Хитой" тараққиёт фондини таъсис этиш имкониятини кўриб чиқиш таклиф қилинди.
Марказий Осиё ва Хитойнинг транспорт жиҳатидан ўзаро боғлиқлигини ривожлантириш яна бир устувор йўналиш сифатида қайд этилди.
"Хитой - Қирғизистон - Ўзбекистон" темир йўли қурилиши бошлангани Евроосиё маконидаги янги транспорт ва транзит коммуникациялари тизимининг муҳим элементи экани таъкидланди. Шу билан бирга, Трансафғон темир йўл магистрали лойиҳасини амалга ошириш янада кенг имкониятлар эшигини очади.
– Ушбу стратегик соҳа истиқболига оид умумий ёндашувларни ишлаб чиқиш учун транспорт идораларимизга дала тадқиқотларини олиб бориш, логистика инфратузилмасини модернизация қилиш имкониятларини ўрганиш, муқобил йўлаклар бўйича юкларни ташиш борасида синов тариқасидаги лойиҳаларини амалга ошириш учун экспертлар гуруҳларини шакллантириш юзасидан топшириқ беришимиз зарур, деб ҳисоблайман,
- деди Ўзбекистон етакчиси.
Ушбу гуруҳлар ишининг натижалари асосида келгуси саммитга қадар транспорт йўлаклари ва замонавий транзит инфратузилмасининг ягона харитасини шакллантириш бўйича аниқ ва асосланган таклифлар ишлаб чиқилиши керак.
Давлатимиз раҳбари иқлим ўзгаришининг барқарор ривожланиш учун жиддий таҳдидларига эътибор қаратиб, 2030 йилгача мўлжалланган "Яшил" ривожланиш дастурини қабул қилишни жадаллаштириш, шунингдек, чўлланишга қарши курашиш, деградацияга учраган ерларни тиклаш, қурғоқчил ва чўл ҳудудларида биоэкологик барқарорликни ошириш бўйича мулоқот ва шериклик учун Экологик альянсни тузишга чақирди.
– Сунъий интеллект ва рақамли технологиялар соҳасидаги ҳамкорлик имкониятларига алоҳида тўхталишни истар эдим. Айнан ушбу йўналишлар бугунги кунда миллий иқтисодиётларнинг рақобатбардошлигини белгилаб, узоқ муддатли ўсишнинг драйвери бўлмоқда,
- деди Президентимиз.
Иқтисодий ҳамкорликнинг барқарор рақамли инфратузилмасини шакллантириш мақсадида катта маълумотлар базалари ва процессинг марказларининг Ўзаро интеграциялашган банклар тармоғини яратиш, шунингдек, асосий энергетика ва транспорт йўналишлари бўйлаб "Марказий Осиё - Хитой" оптик толали алоқа линиясининг рақамли трассасини барпо этиш таклиф қилинди.
– Халқларимизнинг бир-бирининг маданиятини ўзаро бойитиш ва яқинлашишга бўлган умумий интилиши – бу бизнинг бебаҳо бойлигимиздир. Бугун қабул қилинаётган Ўзаро ташрифларни енгиллаштириш бўйича ташаббус ва Маданий-гуманитар тадбирлар дастури айнан шу мақсадларга қаратилган,
- деди Президентимиз.
Бу борадаги ҳамкорликни янада мустаҳкамлаш мақсадида Марказий Осиё мамлакатлари ва Хитойнинг тарихий-маданий ресурсларини ўзида мужассам этган, тадқиқотчилар, талабалар, сайёҳлар ва креатив индустрия вакилларини қамраб олган "Ипак йўли маданий мероси" ягона рақамли порталини яратиш таклиф қилинди.
Шунингдек, профессионал таълим соҳасида ҳамкорлик дастурини ишлаб чиқиш, университет ректорлари форумлари, фанлар академиялари ва илмий-тадқиқот марказлари раҳбарларининг учрашувларини ўтказиш орқали умумий илмий-таълим платформасини шакллантириш мақсадга мувофиқлиги кўрсатиб ўтилди.
Хавфсизлик соҳасидаги ҳамкорлик асосий устувор йўналишлардан бири бўлиб қолмоқда. Шу муносабат билан Президентимиз терроризм, экстремизм, радикализм, наркотрафик, ноқонуний миграция ва кибержиноятчиликка қарши курашишда махсус хизматлар ва хавфсизлик кенгашлари орқали кўп томонлама ахборот алмашиш механизмларини йўлга қўйиш муҳимлигини таъкидлади.
– Биз учун нафақат қўшни, балки умумий тарихий-маданий ва иқтисодий маконимизнинг ажралмас қисми бўлган Афғонистон муаммоларига халқаро ҳамжамият эътиборининг пасайиши жиддий ташвиш уйғотмоқда,
- деди Ўзбекистон етакчиси.
Хитой ва Марказий Осиё давлатларининг Афғонистон билан ҳамкорлигида тўпланган бой тажрибани қайд этиб, Ўзбекистон Президенти ушбу мамлакатнинг тикланишига кўмаклашиш ва уни минтақавий интеграция жараёнларига жалб этиш масалаларини кўриб чиқиш бўйича юқори даражадаги гуруҳни таъсис этишни таклиф қилди.
Гуруҳ учрашувини Термиз шаҳрида Афғонистон вакиллари иштирокида ўтказишга тайёрлик билдирилди.
Давлатимиз раҳбари сўзининг якунида Ўзбекистон "Марказий Осиё - Хитой" форматидаги очиқ мулоқот, прагматик ва ўзаро манфаатли ҳамкорликни кенгайтириш тарафдори эканини таъкидлади.
Йиғилиш сўнгида давлат раҳбарлари Остона декларацияси ва Абадий яхши қўшничилик, дўстлик ва ҳамкорлик тўғрисидаги шартномани имзоладилар.
Шунингдек, ҳукуматлараро ва идоралараро ҳужжатларнинг салмоқли тўплами қабул қилинди.
Саммит якунида камбағалликка қарши, чўлланишга қарши курашиш, таълим соҳасидаги ҳамкорлик марказлари ҳамда тўсиқсиз савдо бўйича ҳамкорлик платформасини ишга тушириш маросими бўлди.

O‘zbekiston Prezidenti Xitoy bilan ko‘p qirrali hamkorlikni kengaytirish bo‘yicha tashabbuslarni ilgari surdi
17.06.2025
O‘zbekiston Respublikasi Prezidenti Shavkat Mirziyoyev 17-iyun kuni Ostona shahrida "Markaziy Osiyo - Xitoy" ikkinchi sammitida ishtirok etdi.
Qozog‘iston Respublikasi Prezidenti Qasim-Jomart Toqayev raisligida o‘tgan tadbirda Xitoy Xalq Respublikasi Raisi Si Szinpin, Qirg‘iz Respublikasi Prezidenti Sadir Japarov, Tojikiston Respublikasi Prezidenti Emomali Rahmon va Turkmaniston Prezidenti Serdar Berdimuhamedov ham qatnashdi.
Kun tartibiga muvofiq, Markaziy Osiyo mamlakatlari va Xitoy o‘rtasidagi o‘zaro manfaatli hamkorlikni ustuvor yo‘nalishlarda kengaytirish istiqbollari, dolzarb xalqaro va mintaqaviy masalalar ko‘rib chiqildi.
O‘zbekiston Prezidenti nutqining avvalida XXR Raisi Si Szinpinning Markaziy Osiyo davlatlari bilan do‘stlik va hamkorlikni mustahkamlash, aniq loyiha va dasturlarni amalga oshirish orqali mintaqaning barqaror taraqqiyotini qo‘llab-quvvatlashdagi o‘rnini alohida qayd etdi.
2023-yilda Sian shahrida o‘tgan birinchi sammitdan so‘ng "Markaziy Osiyo - Xitoy" formatidagi hamkorlikda katta muvaffaqiyatlarga erishilgani mamnuniyat bilan qayd etildi.
Xususan, kotibiyat tashkil etildi, vazirlar, ekspertlar uchrashuvlari va yig‘ilishlarini o‘tkazish mexanizmlari ishga tushirildi, keng ko‘lamli hamkorlikning shartnomaviy-huquqiy bazasi shakllantirilmoqda.
Markaziy Osiyo mamlakatlarining Xitoy bilan tovar ayirboshlash hajmi ortib bormoqda, joriy yilda bu ko‘rsatkich 100 milliard dollarga yetishi kutilmoqda.
– Bizningcha, bir tomondan, ishonch, yaxshi qo‘shnichilik va sheriklik makoniga aylangan Markaziy Osiyoning o‘zidagi chuqur transformatsiya jarayonlari, boshqa tomondan, Xitoy rahbariyatining qo‘shni davlatlar bilan do‘stona munosabatlarni rivojlantirish va “Belbog‘ va yo‘l” global konsepsiyasini ilgari surishga qat’iy sodiqligi ushbu formatdagi hamkorlikning rivojlanishiga imkon bermoqda,
- dedi davlatimiz rahbari.
So‘ng O‘zbekiston yetakchisi mintaqaviy hamkorlikni yanada rivojlantirish bo‘yicha o‘z nuqtayi nazarini bayon qildi.
Avvalo, bu galgi uchrashuv xalqaro vaziyat sezilarli darajada yomonlashgan bir sharoitda o‘tayotgani ta’kidlandi.
Raqobatning ortishi keskinlikning zo‘rayishiga, xavfsizlik va barqaror taraqqiyotga yangi xavf va tahdidlar paydo bo‘lishiga olib kelmoqda.
– Nizoli xalqaro masalalar va ziddiyatli muammolarni hal qilish uchun kuch ishlatish vositalaridan foydalanish o‘zini oqlamaydi va bunga yo‘l qo‘yib bo‘lmaydi, deb hisoblaymiz,
- dedi Prezident.
- Barcha nizo va ziddiyatlar suverenitetni hurmat qilish, xalqaro huquq me’yorlari va Birlashgan Millatlar Tashkiloti nizomi asosida faqat diplomatik sa’y-harakatlar yo‘li bilan – muzokaralar stolida hal etilishi shart.
Shu munosabat bilan sammit davomida mintaqaviy barqarorlikni ta’minlashga umumiy hissa qo‘shadigan Abadiy yaxshi qo‘shnichilik, do‘stlik va hamkorlik to‘g‘risidagi shartnoma qabul qilinishi tarixiy ahamiyatga ega ekani ta’kidlandi. Ushbu shartnomani rivojlantirish maqsadida aniq mexanizm va loyihalarni kiritgan holda Uzoq muddatli sheriklik konsepsiyasini ishlab chiqish taklif etildi.
O‘zbekiston yetakchisi ta’kidlaganidek, Xitoy bilan savdo, investitsiyaviy va texnologik hamkorlik Markaziy Osiyoning barcha mamlakatlarini ijtimoiy-iqtisodiy rivojlantirish strategiyalarini amalga oshirishda kuchli lokomotiv bo‘lib xizmat qilmoqda.
Mintaqa mamlakatlarining o‘sib borayotgan salohiyati va Xitoyning sanoat sohasidagi yetakchiligini birlashtirish bilimlar bilan almashish va texnologiyalar transferining samarali mexanizmlariga ega bo‘lgan umumiy keng imkoniyatlar makoni paydo bo‘lishiga olib kelishi mumkinligi ta’kidlandi.
Yangi iqtisodiy sheriklik dasturini tez fursatda qabul qilish hamda Bosh vazir o‘rinbosarlari darajasida Savdo va investitsiyalar bo‘yicha hududlararo kengashni ta’sis etish bu boradagi amaliy qadam bo‘ladi. O‘zbekiston tomoni kengashning birinchi yig‘ilishini joriy yil oxirigacha o‘tkazishga tayyorligi bildirildi.
Savdo aloqalarini rag‘batlantirish maqsadida O‘zbekiston Prezidenti "Raqamli makon va yo‘l" doirasida "Raqamli Ipak yo‘li" ko‘p tomonlama savdo platformasini tashkil etish tashabbusini ilgari surdi.
Shuningdek, reglament va standartlarni yaqinlashtirish, eksport mahsulotlarini Xitoy talablari asosida sertifikatlash uchun Toshkent shahrida Sanoatda standartlashtirish va sertifikatlashtirish mintaqaviy markazini tashkil etish zarurligi ta’kidlandi.
Biznes, yetakchi ilmiy-tadqiqot institutlari va muhandislik markazlarini jalb qilgan holda, texnologiyalar transferi bo‘yicha alohida "yo‘l xaritasi"ni qabul qilish taklifi bildirildi.
O‘zbekiston yetakchisi iqtisodiy salohiyatni samarali ro‘yobga chiqarish uchun sanoat va infratuzilmaviy o‘zaro bog‘liqlikni kuchaytirish zarurligiga alohida to‘xtaldi. Shu maqsadda "Markaziy Osiyo - Xitoy" sanoat va infratuzilma makoni" uzoq muddatli strategiyasini ishlab chiqish taklif etildi.
Xitoy investitsiyalari, texnologik va ilmiy yechimlarini jalb qilgan holda, o‘zaro bog‘langan sanoat klasterlari, texnoparklar va logistika xablari tizimini yaratish shular jumlasidan.
Markaziy Osiyo mamlakatlari va Xitoy energetika tizimlarini o‘zaro bog‘lash, jumladan, yuqori kuchlanishli elektr uzatish liniyasini barpo etish megaloyihasini amalga oshirish masalalari ham diqqat bilan o‘rganilishi lozim.
Mintaqaviy ahamiyatga molik yirik loyihalarni qo‘llab-quvvatlashga qodir bo‘lgan samarali moliyaviy vositalarni joriy etish masalasi alohida dolzarblik kasb etmoqda.
– Bugungi kunda amalda bo‘lgan xalqaro mexanizmlar, hech shubhasiz, muhim rol o‘ynamoqda, ammo mintaqaning investitsiyaga bo‘lgan talabini to‘liq qoplay olmayapti. Ekspertlarning xulosasiga ko‘ra, Markaziy Osiyoni infratuzilmaviy rivojlantirishda kapital qo‘yilmalar taqchilligi bir necha yuz milliard dollar deb baholanmoqda",
- dedi O‘zbekiston yetakchisi.
Shu munosabat bilan infratuzilmaviy tashabbuslarni ilgari surish uchun samarali platforma bo‘la oladigan "Markaziy Osiyo - Xitoy" taraqqiyot fondini ta’sis etish imkoniyatini ko‘rib chiqish taklif qilindi.
Markaziy Osiyo va Xitoyning transport jihatidan o‘zaro bog‘liqligini rivojlantirish yana bir ustuvor yo‘nalish sifatida qayd etildi.
"Xitoy - Qirg‘iziston - O‘zbekiston" temir yo‘li qurilishi boshlangani Yevroosiyo makonidagi yangi transport va tranzit kommunikatsiyalari tizimining muhim elementi ekani ta’kidlandi. Shu bilan birga, Transafg‘on temir yo‘l magistrali loyihasini amalga oshirish yanada keng imkoniyatlar eshigini ochadi.
– Ushbu strategik soha istiqboliga oid umumiy yondashuvlarni ishlab chiqish uchun transport idoralarimizga dala tadqiqotlarini olib borish, logistika infratuzilmasini modernizatsiya qilish imkoniyatlarini o‘rganish, muqobil yo‘laklar bo‘yicha yuklarni tashish borasida sinov tariqasidagi loyihalarini amalga oshirish uchun ekspertlar guruhlarini shakllantirish yuzasidan topshiriq berishimiz zarur, deb hisoblayman,
- dedi O‘zbekiston yetakchisi.
Ushbu guruhlar ishining natijalari asosida kelgusi sammitga qadar transport yo‘laklari va zamonaviy tranzit infratuzilmasining yagona xaritasini shakllantirish bo‘yicha aniq va asoslangan takliflar ishlab chiqilishi kerak.
Davlatimiz rahbari iqlim o‘zgarishining barqaror rivojlanish uchun jiddiy tahdidlariga e’tibor qaratib, 2030-yilgacha mo‘ljallangan "Yashil" rivojlanish dasturini qabul qilishni jadallashtirish, shuningdek, cho‘llanishga qarshi kurashish, degradatsiyaga uchragan yerlarni tiklash, qurg‘oqchil va cho‘l hududlarida bioekologik barqarorlikni oshirish bo‘yicha muloqot va sheriklik uchun Ekologik alyansni tuzishga chaqirdi.
– Sun’iy intellekt va raqamli texnologiyalar sohasidagi hamkorlik imkoniyatlariga alohida to‘xtalishni istar edim. Aynan ushbu yo‘nalishlar bugungi kunda milliy iqtisodiyotlarning raqobatbardoshligini belgilab, uzoq muddatli o‘sishning drayveri bo‘lmoqda,
- dedi Prezidentimiz.
Iqtisodiy hamkorlikning barqaror raqamli infratuzilmasini shakllantirish maqsadida katta ma’lumotlar bazalari va protsessing markazlarining O‘zaro integratsiyalashgan banklar tarmog‘ini yaratish, shuningdek, asosiy energetika va transport yo‘nalishlari bo‘ylab "Markaziy Osiyo - Xitoy" optik tolali aloqa liniyasining raqamli trassasini barpo etish taklif qilindi.
– Xalqlarimizning bir-birining madaniyatini o‘zaro boyitish va yaqinlashishga bo‘lgan umumiy intilishi – bu bizning bebaho boyligimizdir. Bugun qabul qilinayotgan O‘zaro tashriflarni yengillashtirish bo‘yicha tashabbus va Madaniy-gumanitar tadbirlar dasturi aynan shu maqsadlarga qaratilgan,
- dedi Prezidentimiz.
Bu boradagi hamkorlikni yanada mustahkamlash maqsadida Markaziy Osiyo mamlakatlari va Xitoyning tarixiy-madaniy resurslarini o‘zida mujassam etgan, tadqiqotchilar, talabalar, sayyohlar va kreativ industriya vakillarini qamrab olgan "Ipak yo‘li madaniy merosi" yagona raqamli portalini yaratish taklif qilindi.
Shuningdek, professional ta’lim sohasida hamkorlik dasturini ishlab chiqish, universitet rektorlari forumlari, fanlar akademiyalari va ilmiy-tadqiqot markazlari rahbarlarining uchrashuvlarini o‘tkazish orqali umumiy ilmiy-ta’lim platformasini shakllantirish maqsadga muvofiqligi ko‘rsatib o‘tildi.
Xavfsizlik sohasidagi hamkorlik asosiy ustuvor yo‘nalishlardan biri bo‘lib qolmoqda. Shu munosabat bilan Prezidentimiz terrorizm, ekstremizm, radikalizm, narkotrafik, noqonuniy migratsiya va kiberjinoyatchilikka qarshi kurashishda maxsus xizmatlar va xavfsizlik kengashlari orqali ko‘p tomonlama axborot almashish mexanizmlarini yo‘lga qo‘yish muhimligini ta’kidladi.
– Biz uchun nafaqat qo‘shni, balki umumiy tarixiy-madaniy va iqtisodiy makonimizning ajralmas qismi bo‘lgan Afg‘oniston muammolariga xalqaro hamjamiyat e’tiborining pasayishi jiddiy tashvish uyg‘otmoqda,
- dedi O‘zbekiston yetakchisi.
Xitoy va Markaziy Osiyo davlatlarining Afg‘oniston bilan hamkorligida to‘plangan boy tajribani qayd etib, O‘zbekiston Prezidenti ushbu mamlakatning tiklanishiga ko‘maklashish va uni mintaqaviy integratsiya jarayonlariga jalb etish masalalarini ko‘rib chiqish bo‘yicha yuqori darajadagi guruhni ta’sis etishni taklif qildi.
Guruh uchrashuvini Termiz shahrida Afg‘oniston vakillari ishtirokida o‘tkazishga tayyorlik bildirildi.
Davlatimiz rahbari so‘zining yakunida O‘zbekiston "Markaziy Osiyo - Xitoy" formatidagi ochiq muloqot, pragmatik va o‘zaro manfaatli hamkorlikni kengaytirish tarafdori ekanini ta’kidladi.
Yig‘ilish so‘ngida davlat rahbarlari Ostona deklaratsiyasi va Abadiy yaxshi qo‘shnichilik, do‘stlik va hamkorlik to‘g‘risidagi shartnomani imzoladilar.
Shuningdek, hukumatlararo va idoralararo hujjatlarning salmoqli to‘plami qabul qilindi.
Sammit yakunida kambag‘allikka qarshi, cho‘llanishga qarshi kurashish, ta’lim sohasidagi hamkorlik markazlari hamda to‘siqsiz savdo bo‘yicha hamkorlik platformasini ishga tushirish marosimi bo‘ldi.

Президент Узбекистана выступил с инициативами по расширению многостороннего сотрудничества с КНР
17.06.2025
Президент Республики Узбекистан Шавкат Мирзиёев 17 июня принял участие во втором саммите «Центральная Азия – Китай» в городе Астане.
В мероприятии, состоявшемся под председательством Президента Республики Казахстан Касым-Жомарта Токаева, также участвовали Председатель Китайской Народной Республики Си Цзиньпин, Президент Кыргызской Республики Садыр Жапаров, Президент Республики Таджикистан Эмомали Рахмон и Президент Туркменистана Сердар Бердымухамедов.
В соответствии с повесткой дня рассмотрены перспективы расширения взаимовыгодного сотрудничества стран Центральной Азии и Китая по приоритетным направлениям, актуальные международные и региональные вопросы.
В начале своего выступления Президент Узбекистана особо отметил роль Председателя КНР Си Цзиньпина в укреплении дружбы и сотрудничества с государствами Центральной Азии, поддержке устойчивого развития региона посредством реализации конкретных проектов и программ.
С удовлетворением отмечен большой прогресс в взаимодействии в формате «Центральная Азия- Китай» после первого саммита в городе Сиане в 2023 году.
В частности, создан секретариат, действуют эффективные механизмы встреч и совещаний министров и экспертов, формируется договорно-правовая база полномасштабного сотрудничества.
Растет товарооборот стран Центральной Азии с Китаем, который, по оценкам, в этом году достигнет отметки в 100 миллиардов долларов.
– На наш взгляд, развитию сотрудничества в этом формате способствуют, с одной стороны, процессы глубинной трансформации в самой Центральной Азии, которая превратилась в пространство доверия, добрососедства и партнерства. С другой – это неуклонная приверженность руководства Китая развитию дружественных отношений с соседними государствами и продвижению глобальной концепции «Пояса и Пути»,
– заявил глава нашего государства.
Далее лидер Узбекистана изложил свое видение дальнейшего развития регионального сотрудничества.
В первую очередь отмечено, что нынешняя встреча проходит в условиях заметного ухудшения международной обстановки.
Нарастание соперничества ведет к обострению напряженности, появлению новых вызовов и угроз безопасности и устойчивого развития.
– Считаем неоправданным и недопустимым использование силовых методов для решения спорных международных вопросов и конфликтных проблем,
– подчеркнул Президент.
– Убежден, что все споры и разногласия должны решаться исключительно путем дипломатических усилий – за столом переговоров, на основе принципа уважения суверенитета, норм международного права и устава Организации Объединённых Наций.
В этой связи указано на историческую значимость принятия в ходе саммита Договора о вечном добрососедстве, дружбе и сотрудничестве, который станет общим вкладом в обеспечение региональной стабильности. В развитие этого Договора предложено разработать Концепцию долгосрочного партнерства с включением в нее конкретных механизмов и проектов.
Как отметил глава Узбекистана, торговое, инвестиционное и технологическое партнерство с Китаем выступает мощным локомотивом в реализации стратегий социально-экономического развития всех стран Центральной Азии.
Подчеркнуто, что сопряжение растущего потенциала стран региона и индустриального лидерства Китая способно привести к образованию Общего пространства больших возможностей с эффективными механизмами обмена знаниями и трансфера технологий.
Практическими шагами в данном направлении могли бы стать скорейшее принятие Программы нового экономического партнёрства и учреждение Межрегионального совета по торговле и инвестициям на уровне заместителей премьер-министров. Выражена готовность узбекской стороны провести первую встречу Совета до конца текущего года.
В целях стимулирования торговых связей Президент Узбекистана выступил за организацию многосторонней торговой платформы «Электронный Шелковый путь» в рамках «Цифрового Пояса и Пути».
Также отмечена востребованность создания Регионального центра промышленной стандартизации и сертификации в Ташкенте для сближения регламентов и стандартов, сертификации экспортной продукции по китайским требованиям.
Предложено также принять отдельную «дорожную карту» трансфера технологий, с вовлечением бизнеса, ведущих исследовательских институтов и инженерных центров.
Лидер Узбекистана отдельно остановился на необходимости усиления индустриальной и инфраструктурной взаимосвязанности для эффективного раскрытия экономического потенциала. В этих целях предложена разработка долгосрочной стратегии «Индустриальный и инфраструктурный пояс “Центральная Азия – Китай”».
Речь идет о создании системы взаимосвязанных промышленных кластеров, технопарков и логистических хабов с привлечением китайских инвестиций, технологических и научных решений.
Внимательного изучения требуют также вопросы сопряжения энергетических систем стран Центральной Азии и Китая, включая реализацию мегапроекта строительства высоковольтной линии электропередачи.
Особую актуальность приобретает вопрос внедрения эффективных финансовых инструментов, способных поддерживать крупные проекты регионального значения.
– Действующие сегодня международные механизмы, несомненно, играют важную роль, однако полностью не покрывают инвестиционные потребности региона. По оценкам экспертов, дефицит капиталовложений в инфраструктурное развитие Центральной Азии исчисляется сотнями миллиардов долларов»,
– отметил лидер Узбекистана.
В этой связи предложено рассмотреть возможность учреждения Фонда развития «Центральная Азия – Китай», который мог бы стать эффективной платформой для продвижения инфраструктурных инициатив.
Другим приоритетным направлением обозначено развитие транспортной взаимосвязанности Центральной Азии и Китая.
Отмечено, что запуск строительства железной дороги Китай – Кыргызстан – Узбекистан является важным элементом новой системы транспортных и транзитных коммуникаций на Евразийском пространстве. При этом реализация проекта Трансафганской железнодорожной магистрали откроет еще более широкие возможности.
– В интересах выработки общего видения перспектив в этой стратегической сфере считаю необходимым поручить нашим транспортным ведомствам сформировать экспертные группы для проведения полевых исследований, изучения возможностей модернизации логистической инфраструктуры и реализации пилотных проектов транспортировки грузов по альтернативным коридорам,
– предложил лидер Узбекистана.
По результатам работы этих групп к следующему саммиту должны быть выработаны конкретные и обоснованные предложения для формирования Единой карты транспортных коридоров и современной транзитной инфраструктуры.
Указывая на серьезные вызовы климатических изменений для устойчивого развития, глава нашего государства призвал ускорить принятие Программы «зеленого» развития до 2030 года, а также учредить Экологический альянс для диалога и партнерства в сфере борьбы с опустыниванием, восстановления деградированных земель, повышения биоэкологической устойчивости в засушливых и пустынных зонах.
– Отдельно хотел бы остановиться на возможностях сотрудничества в области искусственного интеллекта и цифровых технологий. Именно эти направления сегодня выступают драйверами долгосрочного роста, определяя конкурентоспособность национальных экономик,
– отметил Президент нашей страны.
В целях формирования устойчивой цифровой инфраструктуры экономического взаимодействия предложено создать Сеть взаимно интегрированных банков больших данных и процессинговых центров, а также построить Цифровую трассу оптико-волоконной линии связи «Центральная Азия – Китай» вдоль основных энергетических и транспортных маршрутов.
– Наш бесценный актив – это общее стремление к взаимообогащению культур и сближению наших народов. Именно на эти цели направлены принимаемые сегодня Инициатива по облегчению взаимных поездок и Программа культурно-гуманитарных мероприятий,
–отметил Президент.
Для дальнейшего укрепления сотрудничества в этой сфере предложено создать единый цифровой портал «Культурное наследие Шелкового пути», объединяющий историко-культурные ресурсы стран Центральной Азии и Китая, с доступом к нему исследователей, студентов, туристов и представителей креативной индустрии.
Указано также на целесообразность формирования общей научно-образовательной платформы посредством разработки программы сотрудничества в области профессионального образования, проведения форумов ректоров университетов, встреч руководителей академий наук и научно-исследовательских центров.
Среди ключевых приоритетов остается взаимодействие в сфере безопасности. В этой связи Президент выступил за налаживание многосторонних механизмов обмена информацией по линии специальных служб и советов безопасности в борьбе с терроризмом, экстремизмом, радикализмом, наркотрафиком, незаконной миграцией и киберпреступностью.
– Серьезную обеспокоенность вызывает снижение внимания международного сообщества к проблемам Афганистана, который для нас – не просто сосед, а неотъемлемая часть общего историко-культурного и экономического пространства,
– заявил лидер Узбекистана.
Отмечая богатый опыт взаимодействия Китая и государств Центральной Азии с Афганистаном, Президент Узбекистана предложил учредить в рамках нынешнего формата Группу высокого уровня по рассмотрению вопросов содействия восстановлению и вовлечению этой страны в региональные интеграционные процессы.
Выражена готовность провести ее встречу в городе Термезе с участием представителей Афганистана.
В завершение выступления подчеркнуто, что Узбекистан привержен открытому диалогу, расширению прагматичного и взаимовыгодного сотрудничества в формате «Центральная Азия – Китай».
По итогам заседания главы государств подписали Астанинскую декларацию и Договор о вечном добрососедстве, дружбе и сотрудничестве.
Также принят солидный пакет межправительственных и межведомственных документов.
В конце саммита состоялась церемония запуска центров сотрудничества по борьбе с бедностью, опустыниванием, взаимодействию в области образования, а также платформы сотрудничества для беспрепятственной торговли.

«Бир макон, бир йўл» форуми бошланди
13.05.2017
Пекин шаҳрида халқаро ҳамкорлик бўйича «Бир макон, бир йўл» форуми бошланди.
Анжуманнинг расмий очилиш маросимида Ўзбекистон Республикаси Президенти Шавкат Мирзиёев иштирок этди.
Асосий ташаббускори Хитой бўлган ушбу лойиҳа икки ва кўп томонлама алоқалар механизмларини янада мустаҳкамлаган ҳолда, халқаро ҳамкорлик ва тараққиётнинг янги моделларини шакллантириш ва илгари суришни назарда тутади.
Бу лойиҳада Ўзбекистоннинг иштироки муҳим аҳамият касб этади. Буюк ипак йўлининг марказида жойлашган юртимиз давлатлараро савдо-иқтисодий ва маданий алоқаларни мустаҳкамлашда катта ўрин тутган.
Буюк ипак йўли бўйлаб ривожланиш тенденцияларини давом эттириш, иқтисодий ҳамкорликнинг янги механизмларини ишлаб чиқиш, жалб этилган давлатларнинг иқтисодий тараққиёти, турли цивилизациялар ўртасидаги алоқаларни мустаҳкамлаш, тинчлик ва барқарор ривожланишга кўмаклашиш мазкур форумнинг асосий мақсадидир.
Бугунги кунда мамлакатимиз барча давлатлар билан ўзаро манфаатли алоқаларга алоҳида эътибор қаратмоқда. “Бир макон, бир йўл” лойиҳаси доирасидаги ҳамкорлик бу борада муҳим аҳамият касб этади.
Президентимиз Шавкат Мирзиёев ташаббуси билан саноат тармоқларини модернизация ва диверсификация қилиш, кичик бизнес ва хусусий тадбиркорликни ривожлантириш, экспортни қўллаб-қувватлаш борасида амалга оширилаётган изчил ислоҳотлар самарасида мамлакатимизда ишлаб чиқарилаётган маҳсулотларнинг рақобатбардошлиги ошиб, ташқи бозорда харидоргирлиги юксалмоқда. Буюк ипак йўли йўналишидаги мамлакатлар ўртасида савдо-иқтисодий ҳамкорликни янада ривожлантириш мақсадида ташкил этилган “Бир макон, бир йўл” лойиҳаси Ўзбекистоннинг ҳам иқтисодий имкониятларини ривожлантириш ва намойиш этишда муҳим аҳамиятга эга бўлади.
Форумда 30 га яқин мамлакатдан давлат ва ҳукумат раҳбарлари, 130 га яқин мамлакат вакиллари иштирок этмоқда. Анжуманда БМТ Бош котиби, Жаҳон банки президенти ва бошқа халқаро ташкилотлар вакиллари ҳам қатнашмоқда.

«Bir makon, bir yo‘l» forumi boshlandi
13.05.2017
Pekin shahrida xalqaro hamkorlik bo‘yicha «Bir makon, bir yo‘l» forumi boshlandi.
Anjumanning rasmiy ochilish marosimida O‘zbekiston Respublikasi Prezidenti Shavkat Mirziyoyev ishtirok etdi.
Asosiy tashabbuskori Xitoy bo‘lgan ushbu loyiha ikki va ko‘p tomonlama aloqalar mexanizmlarini yanada mustahkamlagan holda, xalqaro hamkorlik va taraqqiyotning yangi modellarini shakllantirish va ilgari surishni nazarda tutadi.
Bu loyihada O‘zbekistonning ishtiroki muhim ahamiyat kasb etadi. Buyuk ipak yo‘lining markazida joylashgan yurtimiz davlatlararo savdo-iqtisodiy va madaniy aloqalarni mustahkamlashda katta o‘rin tutgan.
Buyuk ipak yo‘li bo‘ylab rivojlanish tendensiyalarini davom ettirish, iqtisodiy hamkorlikning yangi mexanizmlarini ishlab chiqish, jalb etilgan davlatlarning iqtisodiy taraqqiyoti, turli sivilizatsiyalar o‘rtasidagi aloqalarni mustahkamlash, tinchlik va barqaror rivojlanishga ko‘maklashish mazkur forumning asosiy maqsadidir.
Bugungi kunda mamlakatimiz barcha davlatlar bilan o‘zaro manfaatli aloqalarga alohida e’tibor qaratmoqda. “Bir makon, bir yo‘l” loyihasi doirasidagi hamkorlik bu borada muhim ahamiyat kasb etadi.

Ўзбекистон Президенти ШҲТ доирасидаги кўп томонлама ҳамкорликни кенгайтиришнинг устувор йўналишларини кўрсатиб ўтди
01.09.2025
Ўзбекистон Республикаси Президенти Шавкат Мирзиёев 1 сентябрь куни Тяньцзинь шаҳрида Шанхай ҳамкорлик ташкилоти Давлат раҳбарлари кенгашининг навбатдаги мажлисида иштирок этди.
Хитой Халқ Республикаси Раиси Си Цзиньпин раислигида ўтган тадбирда Беларусь Республикаси Президенти Александр Лукашенко, Ҳиндистон Республикаси Бош вазири Нарендра Моди, Эрон Ислом Республикаси Президенти Масъуд Пезешкиён, Қозоғистон Республикаси Президенти Қасим-Жомарт Тоқаев, Қирғиз Республикаси Президенти Садир Жапаров, Покистон Ислом Республикаси Бош вазири Шаҳбоз Шариф, Россия Федерацияси Президенти Владимир Путин, Тожикистон Республикаси Президенти Эмомали Раҳмон, шунингдек, ШҲТ бош котиби Нурлан Ермекбаев ва Минтақавий аксилтеррор тузилмаси Ижроия қўмитаси директори Уларбек Шаршеев қатнашди.
Кун тартибига мувофиқ, ШҲТ доирасидаги кўп томонлама ҳамкорликни янада ривожлантириш ва ташкилот фаолиятини такомиллаштириш истиқболлари муҳокама қилинди, минтақавий ва халқаро аҳамиятга молик долзарб масалалар юзасидан очиқ фикр алмашилди.
Хитой Раиси Си Цзиньпин давлатимиз раҳбарига сўз берар экан, мамлакатимиз етакчиси ва халқини Мустақиллик куни билан қутлади ҳамда Президент Шавкат Мирзиёев раҳбарлигида Ўзбекистон юксак суръатда ривожланиб, мамлакатда ҳаёт яхшилангани ва Хитой томони бундан жуда мамнунлигини алоҳида таъкидлади.
Президентимиз учрашув иштирокчиларини қутлаб, Хитойнинг ШҲТга раислигини юксак баҳолади ва Иккинчи жаҳон урушидаги Буюк Ғалабанинг 80 йиллиги билан табриклади, шунингдек, ШҲТга аъзо давлатлар делегациялари раҳбарларига Ўзбекистон Республикасининг Мустақиллик куни муносабати билан билдирган самимий табриклари ва эзгу тилаклари учун миннатдорлик изҳор этди.
Мамлакатимиз етакчиси ушбу саммит глобал ноаниқлик шароитида ўтаётганини қайд этди.
Ишончнинг тизимли инқирози, можароларнинг кенгайиб бораётгани, кўп томонлама институтларнинг заифлашиши ва жаҳон савдо тизимининг парчаланиши халқаро хавфсизлик ва барқарорлик архитектураси асосларига путур етказмоқда.
– Бундай шароитда ШҲТ давлатларининг бир-бирини ўзаро тушуниши ва бирдамлиги – бу фақат қимматли бойлик эмас, балки бизнинг бепоён минтақамизда тинчликни сақлашнинг калитидир,
– деди Ўзбекистон етакчиси.
ШҲТ доирасидаги кўп томонлама ҳамкорликни янада мустаҳкамлаш мақсадида давлатимиз раҳбари қуйидаги масалаларга эътибор қаратди.
Энг аввало, ташкилотнинг самарадорлигини ошириш, унинг институтлари ва қарорларни амалга ошириш механизмларини мустаҳкамлаш зарурлиги қайд этилди. Ташкилотни трансформация қилиш бўйича Самарқанд саммитида бошланган жараёнлар ушбу муҳим вазифаларни ҳал этишга ёрдам беришига ишонч билдирилди.
Давлатимиз раҳбари ШҲТни изчил кенгайтириш, унинг мулоқот бўйича шериклари таркибига янги аъзоларни, жумладан, бошқа минтақа давлатларини қўшиш зарурлигини, бу ташкилотни Глобал Жануб мамлакатлари билан ҳамкорлик платформасига айлантиришга ёрдам беришини таъкидлади.
Хавфсизлик соҳасидаги ҳамкорлик ШҲТнинг устувор йўналишларидан биридир.
– Бугунги кунда келишилган ёндашувларга ҳамда ишонч ва хавфсизликни таъминлашнинг янги механизмларига талаб кучайиб бормоқда,
– деди Ўзбекистон Президенти.
Шу маънода, давлатимиз раҳбари Ядро хавфсизлиги йўлида кўп томонлама шерикликни мустаҳкамлаш бўйича ШҲТ декларациясини қабул қилишга чақирди. Ушбу декларация тинчлик йўлидаги атомни ривожлантириш ва фавқулодда ҳолатларга жавоб қайтаришнинг мустаҳкам асосига айланади, Бирлашган Миллатлар Ташкилоти шафелигидаги тарқатмаслик глобал режимига муносиб ҳисса бўлади.
Трансчегаравий таҳдидларга қарши самарали курашиш мақсадида Ички ишлар ва жамоат хавфсизлиги вазирлари кенгаши ишини қайта тиклаш, Жиноятчиликка қарши курашишда ҳамкорлик тўғрисидаги битимни қайта кўриб чиқиш, Гиёҳвандликка қарам бўлиб қолишга қарши курашишнинг 2030 йилга қадар мўлжалланган дастурини ишлаб чиқиш таклиф қилинди.
Ўзбекистон етакчиси “ШҲТ – Афғонистон” мулоқот гуруҳи фаолияти қайта тикланишини қўллаб-қувватлади. Конструктив мулоқотларни ривожлантириш ва Афғонистондаги ижтимоий-иқтисодий лойиҳаларни қўллаб-қувватлаш бўйича таклифларни ишлаб чиқиш унинг асосий вазифаларидан бири бўлиши мумкин.
Жаҳон иқтисодиётида кузатилаётган ҳозирги тенденцияларни ҳисобга олиб, савдо-иқтисодий ҳамкорликни кенгайтиришга устувор аҳамият қаратилмоқда.
– Биз кенг минтақамизда иқтисодий ҳамкорликнинг барқарор моделларини шакллантириш тарафдоримиз,
– деди давлатимиз раҳбари.
Савдони соддалаштириш тартиб-таомиллари тўғрисидаги битимни имзолаш ҳамда минтақавий саноат ва инфратузилма лойиҳаларини молиявий қўллаб-қувватлашнинг самарали воситаларини тезроқ жорий этиш муҳимлиги қайд этилди.
Ишончли ишлаб чиқариш-логистика занжирларини ривожлантириш ва ўзаро сармояларни рағбатлантириш мақсадида ШҲТ доирасида Стратегик материаллар бўйича минтақавий марказ, Энергетика консорциуми, стартап ва инновацион лойиҳаларни қўллаб-қувватлаш ҳамда илгари суриш учун Венчур компаниялари ва жамғармалари тармоғи, бизнес бўйича мулоқотларни йўлга қўйиш ва инвестицияларни илгари суриш учун Махсус электрон портал каби бир қатор янги кўп томонлама тузилмалар ва кооперацияни қўллаб-қувватлаш воситаларини жорий этиш таклиф қилинди.
Давлатимиз раҳбари Шимол – Жануб ва Шарқ – Ғарб йўналишлари бўйича транспорт-транзит салоҳиятини тўлиқ ишга солиш, Марказий Осиё орқали Форс кўрфази ва Ҳинд океани портларига чиқадиган жанубий йўналишдаги йўлакларни ривожлантиришга алоҳида эътибор қаратди.
“ШҲТ ягона транспорт макони”ни шакллантириш ва уни “Бир макон, бир йўл” стратегик ташаббуси билан боғлаш бўйича саъй-ҳаракатларни мувофиқлаштириш учун катта имкониятлар мавжудлиги кўрсатиб ўтилди. Янги мультимодал тармоқлар, рақамли платформалар ва “яшил” йўлаклар яратишни назарда тутувчи концепцияни ишлаб чиқиш таклиф этилди.
ШҲТнинг “яшил” трансформация соҳасидаги ҳамкорлигини кенгайтириш борасида иқлим ўзгаришига мослашиш, ҳавога заҳарли газларни чиқаришни камайтириш, экологик хавф-хатарларни башорат қилиш учун сунъий интеллект технологияларини жорий этиш масалалари бўйича минтақавий платформани ишга тушириш зарурлиги қайд этилди.
– Маданий алоқаларни янада чуқурлаштириш ва халқ дипломатияси институтини кучайтириш ШҲТ доирасидаги узоқ муддатли шерикликнинг муҳим омили ҳисобланади,
– деди Ўзбекистон Президенти.
Халқ ижодиёти халқаро фестивалларини ўтказиш, “ШҲТ университети” шериклик тармоғининг онлайн кампусини яратиш, инновацион йўналишлар бўйича ҳар йили талабалар ва ёш мутахассислар ўртасида танлов ва олимпиадалар ташкил этиш гуманитар алмашувларни ривожлантириш ҳамда халқларимизни янада яқинлаштиришга кучли туртки бериши таъкидланди.
“Сайёҳлик йўлаги” ва ШҲТ тиббиёт туризми альянсини ишга тушириш каби истиқболли лойиҳаларни ишлаб чиқиш таклиф қилинди.
Сўзининг якунида давлатимиз раҳбари Қирғиз Республикаси Президенти Садир Жапаровни Шанхай ҳамкорлик ташкилотига раисликни қабул қилгани билан табриклади.
Хитой Раиси Си Цзиньпин давлатимиз раҳбарига илгари сурилган муҳим ташаббуслар учун миннатдорлик билдириб, уларни биргаликда амалга ошириш муҳимлигини таъкидлади.
Мажлис якунида ҳужжатларни имзолаш маросими бўлди. Хусусан, Тяньцзинь декларацияси, ШҲТни 2035 йилга қадар ривожлантириш стратегияси ҳамда ҳамкорликнинг турли соҳаларида шерикликни янада мустаҳкамлашга қаратилган муҳим кўп томонлама ҳужжатлар тўплами қабул қилинди.

O‘zbekiston Prezidenti SHHT doirasidagi ko‘p tomonlama hamkorlikni kengaytirishning ustuvor yo‘nalishlarini ko‘rsatib o‘tdi
01.09.2025
O‘zbekiston Respublikasi Prezidenti Shavkat Mirziyoyev 1-sentabr kuni Tyanszin shahrida Shanxay hamkorlik tashkiloti Davlat rahbarlari kengashining navbatdagi majlisida ishtirok etdi.
Xitoy Xalq Respublikasi Raisi Si Szinpin raisligida o‘tgan tadbirda Belarus Respublikasi Prezidenti Aleksandr Lukashenko, Hindiston Respublikasi Bosh vaziri Narendra Modi, Eron Islom Respublikasi Prezidenti Mas’ud Pezeshkiyon, Qozog‘iston Respublikasi Prezidenti Qasim-Jomart Toqayev, Qirg‘iz Respublikasi Prezidenti Sadir Japarov, Pokiston Islom Respublikasi Bosh vaziri Shahboz Sharif, Rossiya Federatsiyasi Prezidenti Vladimir Putin, Tojikiston Respublikasi Prezidenti Emomali Rahmon, shuningdek, SHHT bosh kotibi Nurlan Yermekbayev va Mintaqaviy aksilterror tuzilmasi Ijroiya qo‘mitasi direktori Ularbek Sharsheyev qatnashdi.
Kun tartibiga muvofiq, SHHT doirasidagi ko‘p tomonlama hamkorlikni yanada rivojlantirish va tashkilot faoliyatini takomillashtirish istiqbollari muhokama qilindi, mintaqaviy va xalqaro ahamiyatga molik dolzarb masalalar yuzasidan ochiq fikr almashildi.
Xitoy Raisi Si Szinpin davlatimiz rahbariga so‘z berar ekan, mamlakatimiz yetakchisi va xalqini Mustaqillik kuni bilan qutladi hamda Prezident Shavkat Mirziyoyev rahbarligida O‘zbekiston yuksak sur’atda rivojlanib, mamlakatda hayot yaxshilangani va Xitoy tomoni bundan juda mamnunligini alohida ta’kidladi.
Prezidentimiz uchrashuv ishtirokchilarini qutlab, Xitoyning SHHTga raisligini yuksak baholadi va Ikkinchi jahon urushidagi Buyuk G‘alabaning 80 yilligi bilan tabrikladi, shuningdek, SHHTga a’zo davlatlar delegatsiyalari rahbarlariga O‘zbekiston Respublikasining Mustaqillik kuni munosabati bilan bildirgan samimiy tabriklari va ezgu tilaklari uchun minnatdorlik izhor etdi.
Mamlakatimiz yetakchisi ushbu sammit global noaniqlik sharoitida o‘tayotganini qayd etdi.
Ishonchning tizimli inqirozi, mojarolarning kengayib borayotgani, ko‘p tomonlama institutlarning zaiflashishi va jahon savdo tizimining parchalanishi xalqaro xavfsizlik va barqarorlik arxitekturasi asoslariga putur yetkazmoqda.
– Bunday sharoitda SHHT davlatlarining bir-birini o‘zaro tushunishi va birdamligi – bu faqat qimmatli boylik emas, balki bizning bepoyon mintaqamizda tinchlikni saqlashning kalitidir,
– dedi O‘zbekiston yetakchisi.
SHHT doirasidagi ko‘p tomonlama hamkorlikni yanada mustahkamlash maqsadida davlatimiz rahbari quyidagi masalalarga e’tibor qaratdi.
Eng avvalo, tashkilotning samaradorligini oshirish, uning institutlari va qarorlarni amalga oshirish mexanizmlarini mustahkamlash zarurligi qayd etildi. Tashkilotni transformatsiya qilish bo‘yicha Samarqand sammitida boshlangan jarayonlar ushbu muhim vazifalarni hal etishga yordam berishiga ishonch bildirildi.
Davlatimiz rahbari SHHTni izchil kengaytirish, uning muloqot bo‘yicha sheriklari tarkibiga yangi a’zolarni, jumladan, boshqa mintaqa davlatlarini qo‘shish zarurligini, bu tashkilotni Global Janub mamlakatlari bilan hamkorlik platformasiga aylantirishga yordam berishini ta’kidladi.
Xavfsizlik sohasidagi hamkorlik SHHTning ustuvor yo‘nalishlaridan biridir.
– Bugungi kunda kelishilgan yondashuvlarga hamda ishonch va xavfsizlikni ta’minlashning yangi mexanizmlariga talab kuchayib bormoqda,
– dedi O‘zbekiston Prezidenti.
Shu ma’noda, davlatimiz rahbari Yadro xavfsizligi yo‘lida ko‘p tomonlama sheriklikni mustahkamlash bo‘yicha SHHT deklaratsiyasini qabul qilishga chaqirdi. Ushbu deklaratsiya tinchlik yo‘lidagi atomni rivojlantirish va favqulodda holatlarga javob qaytarishning mustahkam asosiga aylanadi, Birlashgan Millatlar Tashkiloti shafeligidagi tarqatmaslik global rejimiga munosib hissa bo‘ladi.
Transchegaraviy tahdidlarga qarshi samarali kurashish maqsadida Ichki ishlar va jamoat xavfsizligi vazirlari kengashi ishini qayta tiklash, Jinoyatchilikka qarshi kurashishda hamkorlik to‘g‘risidagi bitimni qayta ko‘rib chiqish, Giyohvandlikka qaram bo‘lib qolishga qarshi kurashishning 2030-yilga qadar mo‘ljallangan dasturini ishlab chiqish taklif qilindi.
O‘zbekiston yetakchisi “SHHT – Afg‘oniston” muloqot guruhi faoliyati qayta tiklanishini qo‘llab-quvvatladi. Konstruktiv muloqotlarni rivojlantirish va Afg‘onistondagi ijtimoiy-iqtisodiy loyihalarni qo‘llab-quvvatlash bo‘yicha takliflarni ishlab chiqish uning asosiy vazifalaridan biri bo‘lishi mumkin.
Jahon iqtisodiyotida kuzatilayotgan hozirgi tendensiyalarni hisobga olib, savdo-iqtisodiy hamkorlikni kengaytirishga ustuvor ahamiyat qaratilmoqda.
– Biz keng mintaqamizda iqtisodiy hamkorlikning barqaror modellarini shakllantirish tarafdorimiz,
– dedi davlatimiz rahbari.
Savdoni soddalashtirish tartib-taomillari to‘g‘risidagi bitimni imzolash hamda mintaqaviy sanoat va infratuzilma loyihalarini moliyaviy qo‘llab-quvvatlashning samarali vositalarini tezroq joriy etish muhimligi qayd etildi.
Ishonchli ishlab chiqarish-logistika zanjirlarini rivojlantirish va o‘zaro sarmoyalarni rag‘batlantirish maqsadida SHHT doirasida Strategik materiallar bo‘yicha mintaqaviy markaz, Energetika konsorsiumi, startap va innovatsion loyihalarni qo‘llab-quvvatlash hamda ilgari surish uchun Venchur kompaniyalari va jamg‘armalari tarmog‘i, biznes bo‘yicha muloqotlarni yo‘lga qo‘yish va investitsiyalarni ilgari surish uchun Maxsus elektron portal kabi bir qator yangi ko‘p tomonlama tuzilmalar va kooperatsiyani qo‘llab-quvvatlash vositalarini joriy etish taklif qilindi.
Davlatimiz rahbari Shimol – Janub va Sharq – G‘arb yo‘nalishlari bo‘yicha transport-tranzit salohiyatini to‘liq ishga solish, Markaziy Osiyo orqali Fors ko‘rfazi va Hind okeani portlariga chiqadigan janubiy yo‘nalishdagi yo‘laklarni rivojlantirishga alohida e’tibor qaratdi.
“SHHT yagona transport makoni”ni shakllantirish va uni “Bir makon, bir yo‘l” strategik tashabbusi bilan bog‘lash bo‘yicha sa’y-harakatlarni muvofiqlashtirish uchun katta imkoniyatlar mavjudligi ko‘rsatib o‘tildi.

Президент Узбекистана обозначил приоритеты углубления многостороннего сотрудничества в рамках ШОС
01.09.2025
Президент Республики Узбекистан Шавкат Мирзиёев 1 сентября принял участие в очередном заседании Совета глав государств-членов ШОС, состоявшемся в городе Тяньцзине.
В мероприятии, прошедшем под председательством Председателя Китайской Народной Республики Си Цзиньпина, также участвовали Президент Республики Беларусь Александр Лукашенко, Премьер-министр Республики Индия Нарендра Моди, Президент Исламской Республики Иран Масуд Пезешкиан, Президент Республики Казахстан Касым-Жомарт Токаев, Президент Кыргызской Республики Садыр Жапаров, Премьер-министр Исламской Республики Пакистан Шахбаз Шариф, Президент Российской Федерации Владимир Путин, Президент Республики Таджикистан Эмомали Рахмон, а также генеральный секретарь ШОС Нурлан Ермекбаев и директор Исполнительного комитета Региональной антитеррористической структуры организации Уларбек Шаршеев.
В соответствии с повесткой дня обсуждены перспективы дальнейшего углубления многостороннего сотрудничества в рамках ШОС и совершенствования деятельности организации, состоялся открытый обмен мнениями по актуальным вопросам региональной и международной повестки.
Передавая слово главе нашего государства, Председатель КНР Си Цзиньпин поздравил Президента Шавката Мирзиёева и народ Узбекистана с Днём независимости. Он особо подчеркнул, что под руководством Президента  Узбекистан развивается высокими темпами, жизнь народа улучшилась и китайская сторона искренне радуется этим успехам.
Приветствуя участников встречи, глава Узбекистана дал высокую оценку председательству Китая в ШОС и поздравил присутствующих с 80-летием Великой Победы во Второй мировой войне, а также поблагодарил глав делегаций государств-членов ШОС за теплые поздравления и искренние пожелания в связи с Днем независимости Республики Узбекистан.
Лидер нашей страны подчеркнул, что нынешний саммит проходит в условиях глобальной неопределенности.
Системный кризис доверия, эскалация конфликтов, ослабление многосторонних институтов и фрагментация мировой торговой системы подрывают основы международной архитектуры безопасности и стабильности.
– В таких условиях взаимопонимание и солидарность государств ШОС – не просто ценное достояние, а ключ к сохранению мира в нашем обширном регионе,
– отметил лидер Узбекистана.
В целях дальнейшего углубления многостороннего сотрудничества в рамках ШОС глава Узбекистана обратил внимание на следующее.
Прежде всего подчеркнута важность повышения эффективности организации, совершенствования ее институтов и механизмов реализации решений. Выражена уверенность, что запущенный на Самаркандском саммите процесс трансформации организации будет способствовать решению этих задач.
Глава государства выступил за последовательное расширение ШОС, включение в состав ее партнеров новых государств, в том числе за счет стран из других регионов, что будет способствовать превращению организации в платформу сотрудничества с государствами Глобального Юга.
Среди ключевых приоритетов ШОС обозначено взаимодействие в области безопасности.
– Сегодня усиливается потребность в согласованных подходах и новых механизмах доверия и обеспечения безопасности,
– подчеркнул Президент Узбекистана.
В данном контексте глава Узбекистана призвал принять Декларацию ШОС по укреплению многостороннего партнерства во имя ядерной безопасности, которая станет прочной основой развития мирного атома и реагирования на чрезвычайные ситуации, а также важным вкладом в глобальный режим нераспространения под эгидой Организации Объединённых Наций.
Для эффективного противостояния трансграничным угрозам предложено возобновить работу Совещания министров внутренних дел и общественной безопасности, пересмотреть положения Соглашения о сотрудничестве в борьбе с преступностью, а также разработать Программу борьбы с наркозависимостью до 2030 года.
Лидер Узбекистана поддержал возобновление работы Контактной группы «ШОС-Афганистан», одной из основных задач которой могла бы стать разработка предложений по развитию конструктивного диалога и поддержке социально-экономических проектов в Афганистане.
На фоне текущих тенденций в мировой экономике приоритетное значение придается расширению торгово-экономического сотрудничества.
– Мы выступаем за формирование устойчивой модели экономического сотрудничества в нашем обширном регионе,
– заявил глава нашего государства.
В данном контексте отмечена важность подписания Соглашения об упрощении процедур торговли и скорейшее внедрение эффективных инструментов финансовой поддержки региональных промышленных и инфраструктурных проектов.
В целях развития надежных производственно-логистических цепочек и стимулирования взаимных инвестиций предложено создать в рамках ШОС ряд новых многосторонних площадок и инструментов поддержки кооперации, таких как Региональный центр по критическим материалам, Энергетический консорциум, Сеть венчурных компаний и фондов для поддержки стартап и инновационных проектов, Специальный электронный портал для налаживания бизнес-контактов и продвижения инвестиций, с вовлечением регионов.
Глава нашего государства обратил особое внимание на раскрытие транспортно-транзитного потенциала по линиям Север-Юг и Восток-Запад, развитие коридоров в южном направлении, пролегающих через Центральную Азию, с выходом к портам Персидского залива и Индийского океана.
Указано на большие возможности для координации усилий по формированию «Единого транспортного пространства ШОС» и его сопряжению со стратегической инициативой «Пояса и пути». Предложено разработать концепцию, предусматривающую создание новых мультимодальных сетей, цифровых платформ и «зеленых» коридоров.
В контексте расширения партнерства в области «зеленой» трансформации ШОС, отмечена необходимость запуска Региональной платформы по вопросам адаптации к изменению климата, декарбонизации, внедрения технологий искусственного интеллекта для прогнозирования экологических рисков.
– Ключевым фактором долгосрочного партнерства в рамках ШОС является дальнейшее углубление культурных связей и усиление института «народной дипломатии»,
– подчеркнул Президент Узбекистана.
По его словам, мощный толчок для развития гуманитарного обмена и еще большего сближения наших народов могли бы придать проведение Международного фестиваля народного творчества, создание онлайн-кампуса партнерской сети «Университет ШОС», организация ежегодных конкурсов
и олимпиад среди студентов и молодых специалистов по инновационным направлениям.
Предложено также проработать такие перспективные проекты, как запуск «Туристического коридора» и Альянса медицинского туризма ШОС.
В завершение глава нашего государства поздравил Президента Кыргызской Республики Садыра Жапарова с принятием председательства в Шанхайской организации сотрудничества.
Председатель КНР Си Цзиньпин выразил главе нашего государства благодарность за выдвинутые в выступлении важные инициативы и подчеркнул важность их совместной реализации.
По итогам заседания состоялась церемония подписания документов. В частности, приняты Тяньцзиньская декларация, Стратегия развития ШОС до 2035 года, а также пакет важных многосторонних документов, направленных на дальнейшее укрепление партнерства в различных сферах взаимодействия.

ХХР Раиси Ўзбекистон Президентини сайловдаги ишончли ғалабаси билан табриклади
27.10.2021
Ўзбекистон Республикаси Президенти Шавкат Мирзиёев 27 октябрь куни Хитой Халқ Республикаси Раиси Си Цзиньпин билан телефон орқали мулоқот қилди.
Суҳбат аввалида ХХР Раиси давлатимиз раҳбарини Ўзбекистон Республикаси Президентлигига сайлов муваффақиятли ўтказилгани ва унда ишончли ғалабага эришилгани билан самимий қутлади.
Овоз бериш натижалари янги Ўзбекистоннинг тараққиёт стратегияси ҳамда хорижий шериклар билан ўзаро манфаатли ҳамкорликни мустаҳкамлашга қаратилган ташқи сиёсат халқ томонидан кенг қўллаб-қувватланаётганини яна бир бор намойиш этгани алоҳида таъкидланди.
Хитой Раиси Ўзбекистон етакчисига омад ва янги муваффақиятлар, дўст Ўзбекистон халқига эса фаровонлик ва равнақ тилади.
Давлат раҳбарлари Ўзбекистон-Хитой ҳар томонлама стратегик шериклик муносабатларини янада мустаҳкамлашнинг долзарб масалаларини кўриб чиқдилар.
Ишончга асосланган мулоқотнинг бугунги даражаси, жорий йил апрель ойида ўтган мулоқотларда эришилган келишувларга мувофиқ икки томонлама алоқалар ривожланаётгани ва ўзаро алмашинувлар фаоллашгани катта мамнуният билан қайд этилди.
Сиёсий соҳада Ўзбекистон Республикаси Президенти “ягона Хитой сиёсати”ни ҳамда “уч ёвуз куч” – терроризм, экстремизм ва сепаратизмга қарши қатъий курашни доимий қўллаб-қувватлашини билдирди.
Бундан ташқари, коронавирус пандемиясига қарши курашда кўрсатилаётган катта амалий ёрдам, шу жумладан вакциналар ўз вақтида етказиб берилаётгани ва уларни биргаликда ишлаб чиқариш йўлга қўйилгани учун миннатдорлик билдирилди.
Раис Си Цзиньпин, ўз навбатида, Хитой Ўзбекистоннинг суверенитети, мустақиллиги ва ҳудудий яхлитлигини, шунингдек, мамлакатда амалга оширилаётган ижтимоий-иқтисодий янгиланишлар дастурини қатъий қўллаб-қувватлашини таъкидлади.
Савдо-иқтисодий соҳада етакчилар товар айирбошлаш сезиларли ўсаётганини қайд этдилар. Хитой бозорига зарур маҳсулотлар, энг аввало қишлоқ хўжалиги товарларини илгари суриш мақсадида жорий йил ноябрь ойида Шанхай шаҳрида ўтадиган тўртинчи Импорт товарлар халқаро кўргазмасида Ўзбекистон фаол иштирок этишига келишиб олинди.
Беш йиллик Савдо-иқтисодий ҳамкорлик дастурини тайёрлаш, унга стратегик аҳамиятга эга, шу жумладан инновациялар, сунъий интеллект, рақамли технологиялар ва электрон тижорат соҳалари бўйича лойиҳаларни киритиш масаласига алоҳида эътибор қаратилди.
Камбағалликни камайтириш масалаларида тажриба ва билим алмашиш муҳим йўналиш сифатида белгилаб олинди. Шу ойда икки мамлакатнинг ваколатли идоралари томонидан имзоланган меморандумни амалга оширишга алоҳида эътибор қаратилмоқда.
Ўзбекистон ва Хитой раҳбарлари Хитойни минтақамиз билан боғлайдиган ва “Бир макон, бир йўл” ташаббуси доирасида Евроосиё трансқитъавий транзит йўлагини шакллантирадиган самарали транспорт йўналишларини ривожлантириш зарурлигини таъкидладилар.
Фан ва таълим, соғлиқни сақлаш ва аҳолини эмлаш, спорт, туризм, маданият ва бошқа йўналишларда ҳамкорликни кенгайтириш учун имкониятлар мавжуд экани қайд этилди.
Президент Шавкат Мирзиёев ҳамкасби ва дўст Хитой халқига 2022 йилда Пекин шаҳрида ўтказиладиган қишки Олимпия ўйинлари муваффақиятли ўтказилишини тилади.
Жорий йил якунигача Ўзбекистон-Хитой ҳукуматлараро қўмитасининг навбатдаги йиғилишини ўтказиш, шунингдек, дипломатик муносабатлар ўрнатилганининг 30 йиллигини нишонлаш бўйича қўшма дастурни тайёрлашга келишиб олинди.
Ўзбекистон Президенти ва ХХР Раиси халқаро кун тартиби ҳамда минтақавий ҳамкорлик масалалари юзасидан ҳам фикр алмашдилар.
Давлатимиз раҳбари Хитой етакчиси томонидан Бирлашган Миллатлар Ташкилоти Бош Ассамблеясида илгари сурилган Глобал тараққиёт ташаббусини қўллаб-қувватлади.
Бундан ташқари, Жаҳон соғлиқни сақлаш ташкилоти ва БМТнинг бошқа институтлари доирасидаги яқин мулоқотни давом эттиришга келишиб олинди.
Хитой етакчиси мамлакатимизнинг Шанхай ҳамкорлик ташкилотидаги раислигини тўлиқ қўллаб-қувватлади.
Давлат раҳбарлари Афғонистонда мустаҳкам тинчлик ўрнатиш ва иқтисодий тараққиётга эришиш масалаларини ҳам кўриб чиқдилар. Афғон халқига кўмаклашиш мақсадида ШҲТ ва бошқа форматлар доирасидаги мулоқотни давом эттириш ҳақида келишувга эришилди.
Мулоқот якунида Президент Шавкат Мирзиёев ва Раис Си Цзиньпин дўст халқларимиз ва мамлакатларимизга тинчлик-осойишталик, фаровонлик ва равнақ тиладилар.
Суҳбат ҳар доимгидек очиқлик, ишонч ва дўстлик руҳида ўтди.

XXR Raisi O‘zbekiston Prezidentini saylovdagi ishonchli g‘alabasi bilan tabrikladi
27.10.2021
O‘zbekiston Respublikasi Prezidenti Shavkat Mirziyoyev 27-oktabr kuni Xitoy Xalq Respublikasi Raisi Si Szinpin bilan telefon orqali muloqot qildi.
Suhbat avvalida XXR Raisi davlatimiz rahbarini O‘zbekiston Respublikasi Prezidentligiga saylov muvaffaqiyatli o‘tkazilgani va unda ishonchli g‘alabaga erishilgani bilan samimiy qutladi.
Ovoz berish natijalari yangi O‘zbekistonning taraqqiyot strategiyasi hamda xorijiy sheriklar bilan o‘zaro manfaatli hamkorlikni mustahkamlashga qaratilgan tashqi siyosat xalq tomonidan keng qo‘llab-quvvatlanayotganini yana bir bor namoyish etgani alohida ta’kidlandi.
Xitoy Raisi O‘zbekiston yetakchisiga omad va yangi muvaffaqiyatlar, do‘st O‘zbekiston xalqiga esa farovonlik va ravnaq tiladi.
Davlat rahbarlari O‘zbekiston-Xitoy har tomonlama strategik sheriklik munosabatlarini yanada mustahkamlashning dolzarb masalalarini ko‘rib chiqdilar.
Ishonchga asoslangan muloqotning bugungi darajasi, joriy yil aprel oyida o‘tgan muloqotlarda erishilgan kelishuvlarga muvofiq ikki tomonlama aloqalar rivojlanayotgani va o‘zaro almashinuvlar faollashgani katta mamnuniyat bilan qayd etildi.
Siyosiy sohada O‘zbekiston Respublikasi Prezidenti “yagona Xitoy siyosati”ni hamda “uch yovuz kuch” – terrorizm, ekstremizm va separatizmga qarshi qat’iy kurashni doimiy qo‘llab-quvvatlashini bildirdi.
Bundan tashqari, koronavirus pandemiyasiga qarshi kurashda ko‘rsatilayotgan katta amaliy yordam, shu jumladan vaksinalar o‘z vaqtida yetkazib berilayotgani va ularni birgalikda ishlab chiqarish yo‘lga qo‘yilgani uchun minnatdorlik bildirildi.
Rais Si Szinpin, o‘z navbatida, Xitoy O‘zbekistonning suvereniteti, mustaqilligi va hududiy yaxlitligini, shuningdek, mamlakatda amalga oshirilayotgan ijtimoiy-iqtisodiy yangilanishlar dasturini qat’iy qo‘llab-quvvatlashini ta’kidladi.
Savdo-iqtisodiy sohada yetakchilar tovar ayirboshlash sezilarli o‘sayotganini qayd etdilar. Xitoy bozoriga zarur mahsulotlar, eng avvalo qishloq xo‘jaligi tovarlarini ilgari surish maqsadida joriy yil noyabr oyida Shanxay shahrida o‘tadigan to‘rtinchi Import tovarlar xalqaro ko‘rgazmasida O‘zbekiston faol ishtirok etishiga kelishib olindi.
Besh yillik Savdo-iqtisodiy hamkorlik dasturini tayyorlash, unga strategik ahamiyatga ega, shu jumladan innovatsiyalar, sun’iy intellekt, raqamli texnologiyalar va elektron tijorat sohalari bo‘yicha loyihalarni kiritish masalasiga alohida e’tibor qaratildi.
Kambag‘allikni kamaytirish masalalarida tajriba va bilim almashish muhim yo‘nalish sifatida belgilab olindi. Shu oyda ikki mamlakatning vakolatli idoralari tomonidan imzolangan memorandumni amalga oshirishga alohida e’tibor qaratilmoqda.
O‘zbekiston va Xitoy rahbarlari Xitoyni mintaqamiz bilan bog‘laydigan va “Bir makon, bir yo‘l” tashabbusi doirasida Yevroosiyo transqit’aviy tranzit yo‘lagini shakllantiradigan samarali transport yo‘nalishlarini rivojlantirish zarurligini ta’kidladilar.
Fan va ta’lim, sog‘liqni saqlash va aholini emlash, sport, turizm, madaniyat va boshqa yo‘nalishlarda hamkorlikni kengaytirish uchun imkoniyatlar mavjud ekani qayd etildi.
Prezident Shavkat Mirziyoyev hamkasbi va do‘st Xitoy xalqiga 2022-yilda Pekin shahrida o‘tkaziladigan qishki Olimpiya o‘yinlari muvaffaqiyatli o‘tkazilishini tiladi.
Joriy yil yakunigacha O‘zbekiston-Xitoy hukumatlararo qo‘mitasining navbatdagi yig‘ilishini o‘tkazish, shuningdek, diplomatik munosabatlar o‘rnatilganining 30 yilligini nishonlash bo‘yicha qo‘shma dasturni tayyorlashga kelishib olindi.
O‘zbekiston Prezidenti va XXR Raisi xalqaro kun tartibi hamda mintaqaviy hamkorlik masalalari yuzasidan ham fikr almashdilar.
Davlatimiz rahbari Xitoy yetakchisi tomonidan Birlashgan Millatlar Tashkiloti Bosh Assambleyasida ilgari surilgan Global taraqqiyot tashabbusini qo‘llab-quvvatladi.
Bundan tashqari, Jahon sog‘liqni saqlash tashkiloti va BMTning boshqa institutlari doirasidagi yaqin muloqotni davom ettirishga kelishib olindi.
Xitoy yetakchisi mamlakatimizning Shanxay hamkorlik tashkilotidagi raisligini to‘liq qo‘llab-quvvatladi.
Davlat rahbarlari Afg‘onistonda mustahkam tinchlik o‘rnatish va iqtisodiy taraqqiyotga erishish masalalarini ham ko‘rib chiqdilar. Afg‘on xalqiga ko‘maklashish maqsadida ShHT va boshqa formatlar doirasidagi muloqotni davom ettirish haqida kelishuvga erishildi.
Muloqot yakunida Prezident Shavkat Mirziyoyev va Rais Si Szinpin do‘st xalqlarimiz va mamlakatlarimizga tinchlik-osoyishtalik, farovonlik va ravnaq tiladilar.
Suhbat har doimgidek ochiqlik, ishonch va do‘stlik ruhida o‘tdi.

Ўзбекистон ва Хитой етакчилари кўп қиррали ва ҳар томонлама стратегик шерикликни янада кенгайтириш масалаларини кўриб чиқдилар
24.01.2024
24 январь куни Пекин шаҳрида Ўзбекистон Республикаси Президенти Шавкат Мирзиёев ва Хитой Халқ Республикаси Раиси Си Цзиньпиннинг расмий делегациялар аъзолари иштирокидаги музокаралари бўлиб ўтди.
Учрашув аввалида Президентимиз Хитой етакчисига ташриф билан келиш таклифи ва кўрсатилаётган илиқ меҳмондўстлик ҳамда Янги Ўзбекистондаги ислоҳотларнинг юксак эътирофи учун самимий миннатдорлик билдирди.
Давлат раҳбарлари кейинги йилларда икки томонлама муносабатлар ривожида кучли суръатга эришилганини таъкидладилар.
Барча даражаларда алоқалар фаоллашиб, сиёсий мулоқот мустаҳкамланиб бораётгани, мамлакатларимиз муҳим масалалар юзасидан бир-бирини қўллаб-қувватлаётгани алоҳида мамнуният билан қайд этилди.
Ўтган йил ноябрь ойида Пекин шаҳрида Ташқи ишлар вазирлари стратегик мулоқотининг биринчи йиғилиши бўлиб ўтди. Парламентлараро ҳамкорлик фаоллашди.
Президентимиз ХХР Раисига камбағалликка қарши курашиш бўйича ҳамкорликка шахсан эътибор қараётгани ва қўллаб-қувватлаётгани учун ташаккур билдирди.
Томонлар Ўзбекистонда Хитойнинг “Лу Бань устахонаси” профессионал таълим тизимини жорий қилиш бўйича пилот лойиҳа бошланганини олқишладилар.
Савдо-иқтисодий ва инвестициявий ҳамкорлик жадал ривожланмоқда.
Ўтган йил якунлари бўйича товар айирбошлаш 14 миллиард долларга етди. Яқин истиқболда буни 20 миллиард долларга етказиш учун барча имкониятлар борлиги тўғрисида якдил фикр билдирилди.
Кейинги йилларда Хитойдан Ўзбекистон иқтисодиётига инвестициялар ҳажми беш баробар, қўшма корхоналар сони эса уч баробар ошди.
Инфратузилма, саноат кооперацияси, қишлоқ хўжалиги ва “яшил” энергетикада технологиялар трансфери соҳаларида ҳамкорлик дастурларини тайёрлаш ва қабул қилишга келишиб олинди.
Шу маънода, ўтган йил охирида Ўзбекистонда Хитой компаниялари иштирокида қуввати 1000 мегаваттлик иккита янги қуёш электр станциялари фойдаланишга топширилгани мамнуният билан қайд этилди.
Хитойнинг етакчи банклари, “Ипак йўли” фонди ва Осиё инфратузилмавий инвестициялар банки билан самарали молиявий-техник ҳамкорликнинг бугунги даражаси юқори баҳоланди.
Давлатимиз раҳбари инвестиция лойиҳаларини қўллаб-қувватлашнинг молиявий воситаларини кенгайтириш, жумладан, қўшма платформа яратиш борасида келишувларга эришилганини, шунингдек, Хитой Эксимбанкининг Тошкент шаҳрида Марказий Осиё учун минтақавий офис очиш қарорини олқишлади.
Президентимиз хитойлик шерикларни Ўзбекистондаги давлат корхоналари ва банкларини хусусийлаштириш жараёнларида фаол иштирок этишга чақирди.
Етакчилар ҳудудлараро алмашинувлар фаоллашганига мамнуният билдирдилар. Бу борадаги ҳамкорликни мувофиқлаштириш учун Ўзбекистон ва Хитой ҳудудлари кенгашини тузишга келишиб олдилар.
“Бир макон, бир йўл” ташаббуси доирасида Трансминтақавий транспорт ва транзит кўпригининг муҳим таркибий қисми бўладиган “Хитой – Қирғизистон - Ўзбекистон” темир йўлини қуриш бўйича амалий ишларни тез фурсатда бошлаш муҳим экани таъкидланди.
Куни кеча Пекинда биринчи таълим форуми, Шанхайда Ўзбекистоннинг туризм имкониятлари кўргазмаси муваффақиятли ўтгани қайд этилди. Шу кунларда ўтаётган Ўзбекистон маданияти кунлари доирасидаги тадбирлар Хитой пойтахти аҳолиси ва меҳмонларида катта қизиқиш уйғотди.
Таълим ва туризм соҳасидаги ҳамкорликни фаоллаштириш, ўзаро маданият кунларини ўтказиш амалиётини давом эттириш зарурлиги кўрсатиб ўтилди. Қўшма Ёшлар инновация форумини ўтказиш таклиф қилинди.
Режалаштирилган барча тадбирлар ва илгари сурилган ташаббусларни амалга ошириш мақсадида томонлар Ҳукуматлараро қўмита ва унинг барча кичик қўмиталари йиғилишларини жорий йилнинг биринчи ярмида ўтказишга аҳдлашиб олди.
Минтақавий кун тартиби ва халқаро сиёсатнинг долзарб масалалари юзасидан ҳам фикр алмашилди.
“Ягона Хитой” сиёсати ҳамда “уч ёвуз куч”га қарши курашиш борасидаги позиция ўзгармас экани тасдиқланди.
Музокаралар якунида Ўзбекистон етакчиси ХХР раҳбарини ташриф билан мамлакатимизга келишга таклиф қилди ҳамда дўст Хитой халқининг яқинлашиб келаётган хитойча Янги йил – “Чунь Цзе” байрами билан табриклади.
Учрашув ҳар доимгидек ишонч, очиқлик ва дўстлик руҳида ўтди.

O‘zbekiston va Xitoy yetakchilari ko‘p qirrali va har tomonlama strategik sheriklikni yanada kengaytirish masalalarini ko‘rib chiqdilar
24.01.2024
24-yanvar kuni Pekin shahrida O‘zbekiston Respublikasi Prezidenti Shavkat Mirziyoyev va Xitoy Xalq Respublikasi Raisi Si Szinpinning rasmiy delegatsiyalar a’zolari ishtirokidagi muzokaralari bo‘lib o‘tdi.
Uchrashuv avvalida Prezidentimiz Xitoy yetakchisiga tashrif bilan kelish taklifi va ko‘rsatilayotgan iliq mehmondo‘stlik hamda Yangi O‘zbekistondagi islohotlarning yuksak e’tirofi uchun samimiy minnatdorlik bildirdi.
Davlat rahbarlari keyingi yillarda ikki tomonlama munosabatlar rivojida kuchli sur’atga erishilganini ta’kidladilar.
Barcha darajalarda aloqalar faollashib, siyosiy muloqot mustahkamlanib borayotgani, mamlakatlarimiz muhim masalalar yuzasidan bir-birini qo‘llab-quvvatlayotgani alohida mamnuniyat bilan qayd etildi.
O‘tgan yil noyabr oyida Pekin shahrida Tashqi ishlar vazirlari strategik muloqotining birinchi yig‘ilishi bo‘lib o‘tdi. Parlamentlararo hamkorlik faollashdi.
Prezidentimiz XXR Raisiga kambag‘allikka qarshi kurashish bo‘yicha hamkorlikka shaxsan e’tibor qarayotgani va qo‘llab-quvvatlayotgani uchun tashakkur bildirdi.
Tomonlar O‘zbekistonda Xitoyning “Lu Ban ustaxonasi” professional ta’lim tizimini joriy qilish bo‘yicha pilot loyiha boshlanganini olqishladilar.
Savdo-iqtisodiy va investitsiyaviy hamkorlik jadal rivojlanmoqda.
O‘tgan yil yakunlari bo‘yicha tovar ayirboshlash 14 milliard dollarga yetdi. Yaqin istiqbolda buni 20 milliard dollarga yetkazish uchun barcha imkoniyatlar borligi to‘g‘risida yakdil fikr bildirildi.
Keyingi yillarda Xitoydan O‘zbekiston iqtisodiyotiga investitsiyalar hajmi besh barobar, qo‘shma korxonalar soni esa uch barobar oshdi.
Infratuzilma, sanoat kooperatsiyasi, qishloq xo‘jaligi va “yashil” energetikada texnologiyalar transferi sohalarida hamkorlik dasturlarini tayyorlash va qabul qilishga kelishib olindi.
Shu ma’noda, o‘tgan yil oxirida O‘zbekistonda Xitoy kompaniyalari ishtirokida quvvati 1000 megavattlik ikkita yangi quyosh elektr stansiyalari foydalanishga topshirilgani mamnuniyat bilan qayd etildi.
Xitoyning yetakchi banklari, “Ipak yo‘li” fondi va Osiyo infratuzilmaviy investitsiyalar banki bilan samarali moliyaviy-texnik hamkorlikning bugungi darajasi yuqori baholandi.
Davlatimiz rahbari investitsiya loyihalarini qo‘llab-quvvatlashning moliyaviy vositalarini kengaytirish, jumladan, qo‘shma platforma yaratish borasida kelishuvlarga erishilganini, shuningdek, Xitoy Eksimbankining Toshkent shahrida Markaziy Osiyo uchun mintaqaviy ofis ochish qarorini olqishladi.
Prezidentimiz xitoylik sheriklarni O‘zbekistondagi davlat korxonalari va banklarini xususiylashtirish jarayonlarida faol ishtirok etishga chaqirdi.
Yetakchilar hududlararo almashinuvlar faollashganiga mamnuniyat bildirdilar. Bu boradagi hamkorlikni muvofiqlashtirish uchun O‘zbekiston va Xitoy hududlari kengashini tuzishga kelishib oldilar.
“Bir makon, bir yo‘l” tashabbusi doirasida Transmintaqaviy transport va tranzit ko‘prigining muhim tarkibiy qismi bo‘ladigan “Xitoy – Qirg‘iziston - O‘zbekiston” temir yo‘lini qurish bo‘yicha amaliy ishlarni tez fursatda boshlash muhim ekani ta’kidlandi.
Kuni kecha Pekinda birinchi ta’lim forumi, Shanxayda O‘zbekistonning turizm imkoniyatlari ko‘rgazmasi muvaffaqiyatli o‘tgani qayd etildi. Shu kunlarda o‘tayotgan O‘zbekiston madaniyati kunlari doirasidagi tadbirlar Xitoy poytaxti aholisi va mehmonlarida katta qiziqish uyg‘otdi.
Ta’lim va turizm sohasidagi hamkorlikni faollashtirish, o‘zaro madaniyat kunlarini o‘tkazish amaliyotini davom ettirish zarurligi ko‘rsatib o‘tildi. Qo‘shma Yoshlar innovatsiya forumini o‘tkazish taklif qilindi.
Rejalashtirilgan barcha tadbirlar va ilgari surilgan tashabbuslarni amalga oshirish maqsadida tomonlar Hukumatlararo qo‘mita va uning barcha kichik qo‘mitalari yig‘ilishlarini joriy yilning birinchi yarmida o‘tkazishga ahdlashib oldi.
Mintaqaviy kun tartibi va xalqaro siyosatning dolzarb masalalari yuzasidan ham fikr almashildi.
“Yagona Xitoy” siyosati hamda “uch yovuz kuch”ga qarshi kurashish borasidagi pozitsiya o‘zgarmas ekani tasdiqlandi.
Muzokaralar yakunida O‘zbekiston yetakchisi XXR rahbarini tashrif bilan mamlakatimizga kelishga taklif qildi hamda do‘st Xitoy xalqining yaqinlashib kelayotgan xitoycha Yangi yil – “Chun Sze” bayrami bilan tabrikladi.

新华社北京12月12日电　12月12日，“国际和平与信任年论坛”在土库曼斯坦阿什哈巴德市举行，国家主席习近平向论坛致贺信。
习近平指出，今年是土库曼斯坦提议、联合国大会确立的国际和平与信任年，今天又恰逢土库曼斯坦获得永久中立地位30周年。中土两国是志同道合的好朋友、合作共赢的好伙伴。中方坚定支持土方奉行永久中立政策，赞赏土方为维护国际和地区和平稳定、促进各国共同发展作出的积极努力。
习近平强调，当前全球性挑战层出不穷，冲突对抗此起彼伏，世界比以往任何时候都更呼唤和平与信任。历史昭示我们，国际形势越是变乱交织，国际社会越要同舟共济、守望相助。我们要互尊互信互谅，弥合和平赤字，坚定维护联合国权威和地位，坚持以和平方式解决争端，反对霸道霸凌、损人利己。要共商共建共享，破解信任赤字，以国际法治保障公平公义，以多边主义推进团结合作，坚持全球事务大家商量，国际秩序一道维护，治理成果共同分享。
习近平强调，不久前，我提出全球治理倡议，为改革完善全球治理体系提供了中国方案。中方期待同世界各国携手努力，维护世界和平，促进共同发展，推动构建人类命运共同体。

新华社北京12月31日电 新年前夕，国家主席习近平通过中央广播电视总台和互联网，发表了二〇二六年新年贺词。全文如下：
大家好！岁序更替，华章日新。在新年到来之际，我在北京向大家致以美好的祝福！
2025年是“十四五”收官之年。5年来，我们踔厉奋发、勇毅前行，克服重重困难挑战，圆满完成目标任务，在中国式现代化新征程上迈出了稳健步伐。我国经济总量连续跨越新关口，今年预计达到140万亿元，经济实力、科技实力、国防实力、综合国力跃上新台阶，绿水青山成为亮丽底色，人民群众获得感幸福感安全感不断增强。5年历程极不寻常，成绩来之不易。大家拼搏进取、耕耘奉献，铸就了欣欣向荣的中国。我向每一位辛勤付出的奋斗者致敬！
这一年，令人难忘的是，我们隆重纪念中国人民抗日战争暨世界反法西斯战争胜利80周年，设立台湾光复纪念日。国之盛典威武雄壮，胜利荣光永载史册，激励中华儿女铭记历史、缅怀先烈、珍爱和平、开创未来，凝聚起中华民族伟大复兴的磅礴伟力。
我们依靠创新为高质量发展赋能。科技与产业深度融合，创新成果竞相涌现，人工智能大模型你追我赶，芯片自主研发有了新突破，我国成为创新力上升最快的经济体之一。天问二号开启“追星”之旅，雅下水电工程开工建设，首艘电磁弹射型航母正式入列。人形机器人亮出“功夫模式”，无人机演绎绚丽“烟花”。创新创造催生了新质生产力，也让生活更加多姿多彩。
我们以文化滋养精神家园。文博热、非遗热不断升温，世界遗产再添新员，悟空和哪吒风靡全球，古韵国风成为年轻人眼中的“顶流审美”。文旅市场人气火爆，“城超”“村超”热闹非凡，冰雪运动点燃冬日激情。传统与现代交融，中华文化绽放更加灿烂的光芒。
我们共创共享美好生活。我到西藏、新疆出席庆祝活动，从雪域高原到天山南北，各族群众心手相连，像石榴籽一样紧紧抱在一起，大家用洁白的哈达、热情的歌舞，表达对祖国的热爱、对幸福的礼赞。民生无小事，枝叶总关情。过去一年，新就业群体权益有了进一步保障，适老化改造给老年人带来方便，育儿家庭每月多了300元补贴。柴米油盐、三餐四季，每个“小家”热气腾腾，中国这个“大家”就蒸蒸日上。
我们继续敞开胸怀拥抱世界。上合组织天津峰会、全球妇女峰会成功举办，海南自贸港全岛封关运作。为更好应对气候变化，我国宣布新一轮国家自主贡献。继“三大倡议”之后，我提出全球治理倡议，推动建设更加公正合理的全球治理体系。当今世界变乱交织，一些地区仍被战火笼罩。中国始终站在历史正确一边，愿同各国携手促进世界和平发展，推动构建人类命运共同体。
前不久，我出席了全运会开幕式，粤港澳三地同心同行，令人欣慰。要坚定不移贯彻“一国两制”方针，支持港澳更好融入国家发展大局，保持长期繁荣稳定。两岸同胞血浓于水，祖国统一的历史大势不可阻挡！
党兴方能国强。我们开展深入贯彻中央八项规定精神学习教育，徙木立信从严管党治党，去腐生肌推进自我革命，党风政风持续向好。要砥砺初心使命，持之以恒、久久为功，继续回答好延安“窑洞之问”，书写无愧于人民的时代答卷。
2026年是“十五五”开局之年。锐始者必图其终，成功者先计于始。我们要锚定目标任务，坚定信心、乘势而上，扎实推动高质量发展，进一步全面深化改革开放，推进全体人民共同富裕，续写中国奇迹新篇章。
山海寻梦，不觉其远；前路迢迢，阔步而行。让我们拿出跃马扬鞭的勇气，激发万马奔腾的活力，保持马不停蹄的干劲，一起为梦想奋斗、为幸福打拼，把宏伟愿景变成美好现实。
新年的旭日即将升起。祝祖国山河壮丽、大地丰饶，神州沐朝晖！祝大家心有所悦、业有所成，万事皆可期！

特稿丨“活力势不可当”——外媒年终报道里的中国

新华社北京12月27日电
题：“活力势不可当”——外媒年终报道里的中国
新华社记者
2025年，中国以昂扬奋进之姿于时代浪潮中笃定前行。
“生活在明天”“经济活力势不可当”“最具雄心的现代化实践场”“为建设更美好世界铺就新路径”……外媒在年终年末报道回顾这一年的潮起潮涌时，纷纷赞叹一个可信、可爱、可敬的中国。

“生活在明天”
谁能想到，在村头土路上主动停下的，是正在配送包裹的无人驾驶卡车？谁又能想到，它停下的原因是为给13头“横穿马路”的水牛让道？美国《纽约时报》驻华记者基思·布拉德舍在他的年末报道中，描述了他在中国乡村见到的这奇妙一幕。
从驶入乡间小道的机器人卡车，到“天降午餐”的无人机外卖，再到无人驾驶的飞行出租车……种种新奇体验让布拉德舍感慨，在中国仿佛“生活在明天”。
众多国际媒体在年终报道中，聚焦于中国的科技创新力。新华社记者借助大数据工具，梳理了世界各地百余家媒体近期逾1.5万篇涉及中国的报道。结果显示，“人工智能”“技术”等成为这些报道中的高频词。
多篇报道提到，随着科创成果密集涌现，中国在全球创新指数的排名从2012年的第34位升至2025年的第10位。
美国《科学》杂志把“全球可再生能源增长势不可当”列为2025年度十大科学突破之首时，特别指出中国引领着这一重大转型，“中国如今已成为全球可再生能源技术和生产中的主导力量”，“中国蓬勃发展的绿色技术出口也正在改变世界其他地区”。
中国不再只是“世界工厂”，更在塑造“未来的生活方式”。沙特主流媒体《利雅得报》在报道中说，深圳、苏州、杭州……这些城市如今已成为科技创新的代名词，中国正将人工智能等技术与以人为本的城市规划理念有机融合。

2025年1月，国产标志性大语言模型“深度求索（DeepSeek）”横空出世，推动全球人工智能热潮。这出现在多家外媒年底盘点中。路透社在12月一篇报道中说，全球投资者都在加码“下注”中国人工智能公司，期待下一个“DeepSeek”。
外媒更加感叹，中国开放包容、互利共赢的科技创新理念正惠及世界。南非独立在线新闻网站专栏文章说，中非合作已从基础设施和互联互通拓展至人工智能、智慧城市、可再生能源等高科技领域，“对于填补非洲数字鸿沟意义重大”。
“经济活力势不可当”
“道路、轻轨和建筑在立体空间中交错延展，宛如魔幻电影场景。璀璨灯光映照江面，人们的欢笑与火锅热气升腾交织，‘8D之城’重庆迎来又一个不眠之夜……”泰国媒体《今日发布》在年终报道中，以这样的鲜活图景描绘中国经济的活力和烟火气。
年底，国际机构密集上调2025年中国经济增速预期。世界银行、国际货币基金组织、亚洲开发银行分别上调0.4、0.2、0.1个百分点。外媒纷纷聚焦中国经济发展成绩，“市场”“贸易”“开放”都成为海外媒体涉华报道热词。
外媒“热词”
“永远不要低估中国。”彭博社12月24日的文章写到，年初有关中国经济的悲观论调在年末悉数落空，“中国依然是全球最具活力的‘工厂’”。多米尼加《今日报》说：“强劲的生产、贸易和投资增长表明，中国经济活力势不可当。”
高质量实施《区域全面经济伙伴关系协定》，携手各方高质量共建“一带一路”，积极推动加入《全面与进步跨太平洋伙伴关系协定》和《数字经济伙伴关系协定》进程，中国－东盟自贸区升级至3.0版，海南自贸港全岛封关……
中国一年来的对外开放和国际合作成绩单频被提及。许多外媒提到，在自由贸易遭受冲击的当下，中国以坚定的对外开放和合作共赢姿态作出回应，所谓“中国经济见顶论”“中国经济再平衡”等种种谬论不驳自破。
“中国的开放，是对各国迈向共同繁荣的邀请。”美国《欧亚评论》杂志12月23日刊登的专栏文章写道。美国精奢商业观察网站评论道，海南自贸港全岛封关将进一步吸引外商投资，推动自由贸易，促进货物、资本和人员自由流动。
中国的工业体系，是“跨国企业保持全球竞争力的重要保障”，英国《金融时报》刊文感叹，依托完整的产业链体系、持续升级的制造能力与强劲的市场潜力，中国正吸引越来越多欧洲企业扩大在华投资。
“最具雄心的现代化实践场”
“自贡市对西班牙人来说有些陌生，却是一座能深刻揭示中国区域发展模式的城市。自贡市成功将其历史遗产，尤其是悠久的盐业传统与丰富的恐龙化石考古资源转化为独特的价值，实现与新兴产业、先进技术以及城市规划和谐共生。”
在西班牙知华讲堂网站年末刊发的文章《来自上海的笔记》中，西班牙工人社会党成员巴勃罗·苏洛阿加讲述了他在成都、自贡和合肥等多个城市的走访见闻。“中国是由因地制宜政策与多元发展规划共同绘就的多彩‘马赛克’。”他写道，“中国已成全球最具雄心的现代化实践场。”
“发展”和“信心”，是大数据梳理发现的外媒年末涉华报道高频词。美国《纽约时报》评论说，中国今年展现出日益增强的自信心，这份自信植根于“对自身治理体系与发展路径的认可”，“国际社会赞誉进一步提升中国自信”。
从年初全国两会锚定年度发展目标，到金秋党的二十届四中全会擘画远景蓝图，再到年底中央经济工作会议衔接收官与开局……中国坚持将短期目标与长远战略相结合的治国智慧，成为多家外媒在年终报道中解读与热议的焦点。
南非主流媒体《邮卫报》刊文回顾说，中共二十届四中全会审议通过“十五五”规划建议，将中国置于通往2035年基本实现社会主义现代化目标的重要节点上，把过去五年的成就与朝向自立自强和共同福祉的未来连接起来。“当世界处于摇摆不定时，这次会议指引我们向东看。”

巴基斯坦《论坛快报》报道说，在全球经济形势动荡的背景下，中国彰显出在政策制度层面的从容与自信。
在多家外媒看来，这份自信来自国家治理成效，也来自人民的信任。“多项调查研究显示，中国民众对政府抱有极高信任度”，澳大利亚期刊“珍珠与刺激”在其2025年回顾文章中说，这源于中国稳健向好的经济发展和持续完善的民生福祉。
“为建设更美好世界铺就新路径”
11月，联合国气候变化大会在巴西贝伦开幕。在美国缺席、气候议题在世界多地遇冷的背景下，大会国家馆区的“中国角”成了与会代表的热门“打卡地”，“中国角”相关系列边会几乎场场座无虚席。
德国墨卡托中国研究中心年末的文章记录了这一场景。“言必信，行必果”——文章引用中方在大会上表态，阐释中国在气候领域的世界贡献。
单边主义逆流涌动、地缘冲突延宕外溢、气候异常灾害频发、技术变革暗藏风险……多家外媒在年末报道中提及世界所面临的多重挑战，并不约而同地指出，中国在一系列全球性议题上在场、发声、作为，为动荡世界注入稳定性和确定性。
“秩序”“和平”“合作”，在这些大数据显示的全球媒体年末涉华报道高频词背后，是对中国贡献、中国力量的认可。
埃及《金字塔报》网络版刊文指出，在单边主义抬头、阵营对抗加剧的当今，中国选择持续推进合作与交流，强调以协作化解分歧，“为构建更加公正合理的国际秩序作出重要贡献”。
2025年11月5日，一艘货轮满载货物驶出青岛自贸片区（无人机照片）。新华社发（张进刚摄）
在多家外媒看来，中国对世界更为深远的贡献，在于理念引领。今年，中国提出全球治理倡议，与全球发展倡议、全球安全倡议、全球文明倡议相辅相成，共同构成构建人类命运共同体的战略引领，为动荡变革中的世界“指明方向”。
巴西247新闻网日前报道说，四大全球倡议旨在应对国际合作中关键领域的挑战，为解决贫困问题、各类冲突、文明隔阂及治理体系薄弱等提供综合性方案，为国际社会提供稳定预期和公共产品，“为建设更美好世界铺就新路径”。
中国为动荡世界带来的稳定力量，既源于务实行动，更源于直抵人心的理念主张——卢旺达“非中评论”网在年终报道中说，中国为推动平等有序的世界多极化、普惠包容的经济全球化注入动力，为全人类福祉锚定更加光明的未来。

谱写新时代中国高水平对外开放的崭新篇章——写在海南自由贸易港正式启动全岛封关之际
发布时间：2025-12-18
来源：新华社

世界的目光，聚焦中国南海之滨。
2025年12月18日，海南自由贸易港正式启动全岛封关，中国对外开放迎来新的里程碑时刻。
建设海南自由贸易港，是习近平总书记亲自谋划、亲自部署、亲自推动的改革开放重大举措。历经七年多的精心筹备与建设，海南自贸港如期启动封关，正式迈入发展新阶段。
封关不是封岛，而是进一步扩大开放。在世界经济格局深刻演变的今天，中国以实际行动兑现开放承诺，以坚定决心冲破单边主义、保护主义逆流，为推动经济全球化、构建开放型世界经济注入更多稳定力量。
历史长河奔涌浩荡，中国开放潮声澎湃。海南自贸港封关运作，不是一地一域的局部安排，而是牵引全国、增益世界的战略擘画，不仅为海南跨越式发展提供历史性机遇，也将为全面建设社会主义现代化国家注入强劲动能，向世界展现共享机遇、共创繁荣的中国担当。
迈向最高水平开放形态的“关键一跃”
18日上午，海南省人大会堂。海南自由贸易港全岛封关启动会举行，与会人士、媒体记者等神情专注，静候历史性时刻。
海南自由贸易港正式启动全岛封关！9时18分，随着会议宣布消息，现场掌声雷动，经久不息。

当天，海南全岛对外开放口岸及“二线口岸”监管设施悉数启用，标志着3万多平方公里的海南岛，正式成为海关监管特殊区域，“‘一线’放开、‘二线’管住、岛内自由”的全新篇章就此开启。
自1988年建省办经济特区以来，海南从一座边陲小岛逐步成长为我国改革开放的前沿窗口，但经济社会发展仍面临产业基础薄弱、要素流动不畅等短板。
新时代的海南被赋予新使命。2018年4月13日，习近平总书记在庆祝海南建省办经济特区30周年大会上宣布，“党中央决定支持海南全岛建设自由贸易试验区，支持海南逐步探索、稳步推进中国特色自由贸易港建设”。
在习近平总书记擘画领航下，海南经济社会迈入高质量发展快车道。
百尺竿头，更进一步。自贸港全岛封关，更为海南带来跨越式发展的历史性机遇。
这种机遇，来自开放政策优化升级塑造的成本优势。

“零关税”商品税目比例大幅跃升至74%，覆盖大多数生产设备和原材料；加工增值货物内销免关税政策作出四重优化；禁限清单大幅放宽旧机电产品进口管理……一系列封关政策，将为享惠主体带来真金白银的利好。
近日，一批采自俄罗斯、价值超2300万元的“零关税”探测器组件顺利进入华能海南昌江核电有限公司厂房。
“封关政策给企业带来实实在在的利好，能帮助我们降低生产成本。”该公司关务负责人徐剑锋说，封关后，公司将第一时间利用“零关税”新政策，再从法国进口一批价值约1400万元的阀门设备。
“封关政策进一步降低企业享惠门槛，有利于带动加工制造业转型升级，夯实海南的实体经济。”海南省财政厅厅长蔡强说。
这种机遇，来自要素自由便利流动释放的发展活力。
海南自贸港政策制度体系，涵盖贸易、投资、运输、人员进出、跨境资金流动自由便利和数据安全有序流动等方方面面。封关后，这些领域的开放探索将持续加码。

“借助海南数据跨境流动优势和免签政策，我们签约了1000多名海外主播，覆盖30多个国家，单月跨境销售额最高达347万元。”海南您好传媒科技集团有限公司董事长阮宁说，自贸港政策推动企业快速成长，助力本土产品精准触达全球消费者。
截至目前，海口复兴城已集聚8000余家数字经济相关企业，年营收超1600亿元，成为海南数字经济发展的生动样板。
这种机遇，来自人才与科技双轮驱动的创新生态。

2022年来到三亚崖州湾科技城后，博雅工道（北京）机器人科技有限公司董事长熊明磊深耕水下机器人研发领域，带领团队攻克多项关键技术，实现绝大多数关键零部件自主研发，打破欧美垄断，助力我国海洋高新技术产业升级。
“我们将抓住封关运作机遇壮大人才团队，结合海南自贸港新形势、新政策，拓展国际合作、扩大业务范围。”熊明磊说。
鱼跃龙门，海阔天高。中国世界贸易组织研究会首席专家崔凡说，全岛封关是海南自贸港迈向全球最高水平开放形态的“关键一跃”。
助力全国构建新发展格局的“重要落子”

18日上午，在海口新海港和南港“二线口岸”（货运）集中查验场，海南维力医疗科技开发有限公司的41万支一次性使用乳胶导管顺利通过“二线口岸”，跨越琼州海峡运往国内市场。
“现在加工增值免关税政策申报更简便、通关流程更便捷，企业享受到的政策红利进一步扩大。”海南维力医疗总经理贺勇慎说。
不谋全局者，不足以谋一域。习近平总书记指出，高标准建设海南自由贸易港，主要目的是促进海南高质量发展，助力全国构建新发展格局。
得益于独特的区位与政策优势，海南自贸港愈发成为制度型开放试验田、产业升级新高地和区域协同发展枢纽，为构建全国新发展格局注入新动能。
助力全国发展，海南是引领制度型开放与集成式改革的试验田。
从实施“零关税”政策、企业和个人两个“15%”所得税政策，到设立多功能自由贸易账户、实施跨境服务贸易负面清单，海南积极探索推进制度型开放。其培育形成的173项制度创新案例，更为全国范围内的改革开放提供了可借鉴、可推广的样本。
“从历史角度看，海南在开放中作出了新表率，相关经验正逐步向全国推广。”经济学家曹远征说，改革的本质是制度建设，要延续以开放促改革的经验，通过更高水平开放推动制度更加完善。

助力全国发展，海南是培育新质生产力、服务国家战略的新高地。
瞄准国家战略所需，依托独特地理纬度、海洋深度、热带温度及生态绿色的独特优势，海南用好自贸港开放政策，全力发展深海、航天、种业等未来产业。
前不久，星际荣耀运载火箭总装总测复用工厂项目（一期）在文昌正式落成。“选择海南文昌，是因为这里拥有得天独厚的纬度优势、海域优势和自贸港的政策优势。”星际荣耀集团董事长彭小波说，工厂将面向全球商业航天企业提供一站式服务，助推中国商业航天在全球舞台占据更核心地位。
文昌火箭“问鼎苍穹”、三亚深海“探秘龙宫”、南繁硅谷“播种天下”……这些未来产业正在海南蓬勃兴起。
封关后，更加自由便利的制度环境，还将吸引高端制造、生物医药、数字经济等更多新兴产业向海南集聚，让投身自贸港建设的企业共享新质生产力的更多红利。
助力全国发展，海南是区域联动与协同发展的新枢纽。
借助自贸港对外投资、贸易、金融等便利政策，广东海南先进制造业合作产业园、湘琼先进制造业共建产业园等一批跨省合作产业园区在海南“开花结果”，成为区域联动发展的生动样本。
在东方市湘琼先进制造业共建产业园，机械轰鸣声此起彼伏，一派热火朝天的建设景象。园区自2023年设立以来，已落地产业项目31个，项目总投资近140亿元。
湖南出海，海南出彩。该产业园现场指挥部副指挥长谭丽艳说，借助自贸港政策红利以及区位和开放优势，湖南企业“借港出海”开拓国际市场，海南则“借力成长”发展先进制造业。
“内陆省份与自贸港联动，助力内陆省份企业发展，也让自贸港建设服务于全国高水平对外开放和高质量发展大局。”谭丽艳说。
未来，海南自贸港将加强同粤港澳大湾区联动发展，深化同京津冀、长三角、长江经济带等区域合作，深度融入共建“一带一路”，在推进高水平对外开放中发挥牵引作用。
推动构建开放型世界经济的标志之举

封关启动当日，一艘货轮鸣响汽笛，缓缓驶入洋浦港，为京博（海南）新材料有限公司运来17.9万吨、货值近4亿元的石化原辅料。
这是海南自贸港封关后，洋浦港口岸第一批通关的“零关税”石化原辅料。得益于“零关税”政策优化调整，企业预计可节省资金近千万元。
背靠国家广阔腹地，面朝太平洋与印度洋的无垠碧波，海南自贸港全岛封关，成为我国推动构建开放型世界经济的标志之举。
这是在逆风中扬开放旗帜、在变局中稳发展信心的大国担当。
当今世界，保护主义抬头、单边主义盛行，自由贸易遭受冲击。复杂局势中，中国选择以更大力度主动开放、推动合作。海南自贸港封关，正是向世界传递出的清晰、坚定的开放承诺。
“建设海南自由贸易港的战略目标，就是要把海南自由贸易港打造成为引领我国新时代对外开放的重要门户。”习近平总书记为海南自贸港建设指路引航。
中国（海南）改革发展研究院院长迟福林认为，海南自贸港如期实现封关运作，正是以大力推进制度型开放、加快构建开放型经济新体制的实际行动，向世界宣告：中国开放的大门不会关闭，只会越开越大。
这是促进国内国际双循环、把握未来先机的战略主动。
“如果把国内国际双循环比作一个‘8’字，海南自贸港可以看作是中间的交汇点。”中国国际经济交流中心资深专家咨询委员会委员魏建国说，随着海南自贸港封关运作，这一交汇点的作用将更加凸显。
海南是全国最大的椰子加工基地，年加工椰子超2亿个，其中大部分来自印度尼西亚。2024年，从印尼帕鲁港直通洋浦港的“椰子快线”开通，海运周期从40天锐减至7天。这不仅架起了中印尼贸易的新桥梁，更使印尼椰子能经洋浦枢纽快速对接全球航线，走向世界。
世界自由区组织首席执行官萨米尔·昂鲁尼说：“封关后，海南与东盟、南亚、太平洋地区及中东在海运、航空和数字等领域的联系将更加密切，凭借良好的伙伴关系与高效的物流联通，海南有望成为区域合作的重要平台。”
这是敞开开放合作之门、让世界共享机遇的东方邀请。
一个开放的海南自贸港，持续吸引全球投资者的目光。
法国路威酩轩的时尚版图、瑞士瑞联银行的金融布局、美国邓白氏的数据网络、德国西门子能源的绿色方案、新加坡普洛斯的物流链条……全球多领域知名企业落子海南，在这片热土上寻求商机。
过去五年，海南自贸港实际使用外资1025亿元，年均增长14.6%；新设外资企业超8000家，年均增长超43%；截至目前，超过170个国家和地区在琼投资，海南经济外向度提高到35%。
“封关后，海南自贸港将成为全球资本配置的‘重要节点’，全球经济治理创新的‘试验平台’。”斯通伍德·耀石中国首席执行官、大洋洲自贸中心主席孙赫阳说。今年以来，该中心已承接12场国际交流活动，吸引全球多地的企业、资本与人才汇聚海南，在多个领域达成多项合作意向。
笃行求变。改革开放的精神一脉相承，因封关运作这场深刻变革在南海之滨更加澎湃。
万里同风。站在新起点上，海南自贸港正以海纳百川的胸怀，向世界发出携手前行的时代邀约。

新华社北京12月30日电（记者孙楠、曹嘉玥）中共中央政治局委员、外交部长王毅30日在北京出席2025年国际形势与中国外交研讨会开幕式并作主旨发言。
王毅表示，2025年，我们在以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导下，高举构建人类命运共同体旗帜，以元首外交为战略引领，用最大诚意团结世界进步力量，尽最大努力汇聚和平发展能量，做世界和平乱局中的稳定锚、周边环境新局中的主心骨、国际秩序变局中的定盘星、全球发展困局中的主引擎、国际道义危局中的压舱石，不断开创中国特色大国外交新境界。
王毅强调，中国与世界的关系正在朝着更加积极的方向发展，中国的国际影响力、创新引领力、道义感召力显著提升。中国外交之所以从容自信、破浪前行，关键在于习近平主席领航掌舵，关键在于习近平外交思想科学指引，关键在于党中央集中统一领导，同时也在于广大人民群众的大力支持，在于中国的外交理念始终占据国际道义的制高点。
王毅表示，2026年，中国特色大国外交要更有作为。我们将为国家发展民族振兴提供更坚实战略支撑，为走出大国关系新路开辟更有效途径，为构建周边命运共同体作出更积极努力，为全球南方共同迈向现代化汇聚更磅礴力量，为全球开放合作注入更强劲动力，为改革完善全球治理作出更突出贡献，为捍卫国家利益展现更坚定使命担当。

新华社南宁12月30日电（记者朱丽莉、赵欢）12月30日上午，广西北部湾港万吨巨轮列阵，汽笛长鸣。随着今年第1000万个集装箱被平稳吊装到“新防城”轮上，北部湾港正式迈入千万标箱大港行列。当天，北部湾港第100条集装箱航线——柬埔寨贡布航线首航，西部陆海新通道第10218列铁海联运班列发车。
西部陆海新通道北接丝绸之路经济带，南连21世纪海上丝绸之路，协同衔接长江经济带，在中国区域协调发展格局中具有重要战略地位。北部湾港是中国西部地区面向东盟最近的出海口，也是西部陆海新通道重要的枢纽海港。
中国交通运输部公布的数据显示，今年1至11月全国主要港口集装箱吞吐量前十位依次是上海港、宁波舟山港、深圳港、青岛港、广州港、天津港、厦门港、苏州港（内河）、北部湾港、日照港。其中，上海港超5000万标箱，领跑全国；北部湾港为910万标箱、同比增速达10.8%，表现亮眼。

“我们通过钦州港等北部湾港口开展运输，看到了中国西部市场的巨大潜力。”泰国驻南宁总领事馆总领事彬嘉玛·塔维她雅浓说，交通物流条件持续改善，为泰中及东盟国家深化经贸合作提供了良好基础。
据介绍，自2019年《西部陆海新通道总体规划》发布以来，西部地区经广西北部湾港出海的东、中、西三条主通道加速形成，北部湾集装箱航线通达100多个国家和地区的200多个港口、货物和集装箱吞吐量稳居全国前列，沿线省份经广西进出口贸易额从3448亿元增长到2024年的6769亿元。西部陆海新通道铁海联运班列服务网络已覆盖18省75市163个站点，通道辐射带动作用进一步增强。
广西壮族自治区发展和改革委员会主任白松涛表示，“十五五”期间，广西将围绕2035年全面建成西部陆海新通道这一目标任务，进一步深化与东盟国家的开放合作，打造一批集航运、通关、物流、商贸、金融等为一体的新通道服务业。

新华社巴库12月30日电
记者手记｜“这个项目对联通欧亚意义非凡”——中企承建格鲁吉亚现代化铁路项目见闻
新华社记者刘书辰 陈俊锋
“中国同事的专业素养令我获益匪浅，与他们合作愉快而高效。十多年的共事让我们结下深厚情谊，我早已把他们当成‘家里人’。”现年34岁的列万·托特拉泽日前在中企承建的格鲁吉亚现代化铁路项目通车仪式期间接受记者采访说。
托特拉泽目前在中铁二十三局集团有限公司承建的这一项目上担任试验员，主要负责为项目施工质量与安全提供试验检测。他告诉记者：“这是我职业生涯中时间最长、最重要的一份工作。我们格鲁吉亚人来到项目上工作，就像融入一个大家庭。如果以后能继续和这个团队一起建设新项目，我会非常乐意。”
12月24日晚，记者前往距格首都第比利斯约120公里的格中部城市哈舒里，采访格鲁吉亚现代化铁路项目通车仪式。夜空飘着雨夹雪，气温降至摄氏零度以下，作为项目关键组成部分的T9隧道东口被彩灯点亮。不远处，临时搭建的观礼台氛围热烈。格总理科巴希泽率领十多名政府要员出席活动，充分显示格方对这一项目正式通车的重视。
格鲁吉亚现代化铁路项目连接哈舒里市与泽斯塔福尼市，是格东西铁路干线的核心升级工程，也是跨里海国际运输走廊（“中间走廊”）在外高加索地区的重要组成部分，还是中格共建“一带一路”合作的重大成果之一。科巴希泽在仪式上致辞说，格政府致力于将格鲁吉亚打造为“中间走廊”关键可靠的一环，确保货物快速、安全、畅通运输，格鲁吉亚铁路现代化正是实现这一愿景的一部分。
“这是个值得铭记的大日子，这个项目对联通欧亚意义非凡。我为自己能参与这样的大工程感到光荣。”身着白色西服套裙参加仪式的克捷万·凯绍里告诉记者。凯绍里于2022年加入项目团队，从一名翻译成长为行政部副主管。她家住哈舒里市附近，见证了当地民众对项目的好感度不断上升。“火车经过这一地区的时间将缩短大约40至50分钟，越来越多格鲁吉亚人认识到项目带来的好处。”
格鲁吉亚现代化铁路项目于2011年开工建设，线路全长约41公里，穿行于地质条件复杂的苏拉米山脉。据介绍，线路客运设计时速120公里，货运设计时速80公里。其中，全长8.3公里的单线双洞铁路隧道T9隧道是关键控制性工程，建设者需应对富水岩层、可燃气体释放、围岩破碎等多重技术难题，工程施工难度被业内技术人员比作“在地层深处绣花”。
“这个项目难度很高，此前很长一段时间都没人敢啃这块‘硬骨头’。建设期间还遇到新冠疫情冲击等挑战，但是中国企业不畏艰难，用高超的技术、非凡的勇气顺利完成项目。项目解决了旧线路限速多、维护难等问题，极大提升了格鲁吉亚铁路的运行效率。”项目监理公司ILF工程咨询格鲁吉亚公司项目副经理格奥尔基·卡亚亚对记者说。
据中铁二十三局集团有限公司介绍，项目建设期间累计吸纳约1000名格鲁吉亚员工就业，中方一边施工一边通过实践教学帮助他们掌握专业技术，为格培养出了一批铁路建设技术人才。
科巴希泽表示，铁路现代化是格铁路技术标准的跨越，同时也是该国面向未来做出的重要选择。格鲁吉亚铁路的今天是格中两国铁路建设者辛勤付出的结晶。“依靠这样的项目，我们正在创造一个更好的未来。”
中铁二十三局集团有限公司格鲁吉亚分公司副总经理郭海在接受记者采访时说，项目团队还将继续参与格鲁吉亚其他铁路项目，为格交通事业发展提供长期支持。“我们愿以这条铁路为起点，在基础设施、产能合作等领域深化中格合作。”

更好发挥物流对提升产业链供应链韧性与安全水平的支撑作用，工作计划明确，重点加快研制冷链物流、医药物流、多式联运等涉及物流数智化、融合化发展相关标准，以及危险货物运输等涉及物流安全强制性国家标准。
支撑物流数字化转型、智能化改造，工作计划提出，重点研制物流数据基础架构、物流数据交互共享、物流企业数据管理标准，进一步完善商品条码、商品二维码等信息采集技术标准在物流领域的应用。
提升物流基础设施功能，工作计划要求，重点面向国家物流枢纽、物流园区、仓储配送中心等重要物流基础设施，加快研制基础设施功能设计、服务能力、数字化评价等标准，提升物流基础设施联通水平，健全“通道+枢纽+网络”现代物流运行体系。
据介绍，“十四五”以来，市场监管总局持续强化物流标准化工作，新发布物流领域国家标准207项，覆盖物流园区、多式联运、快递绿色包装、进口冷链食品追溯、集装箱电子数据交换、货运无人机等重点领域。下一步，市场监管总局将联合相关部门持续升级物流标准体系，推进标准落地见效。

学习规划建议每日问答丨如何理解高质量共建“一带一路”
发布时间：2025-12-27
来源：新华社
分享：
新华社北京12月27日电　共建“一带一路”是我国改革开放后提出的第一个全球性、大规模、全方位国际经济合作倡议。《中共中央关于制定国民经济和社会发展第十五个五年规划的建议》强调：“高质量共建‘一带一路’。”这是以习近平同志为核心的党中央深刻洞察全球发展大势、统筹国内国际两个大局作出的重大部署，是新形势下扩大高水平对外开放、开创合作共赢新局面的重要路径，也是为中国式现代化营造良好外部环境的重要举措。
2013年以来，在习近平总书记亲自谋划、亲自部署、亲自推动下，共建“一带一路”取得了重大成就，合作领域不断拓展、合作范围不断扩大、合作层次不断提升，国际感召力、影响力、凝聚力不断增强，为增进同共建国家友谊、促进共建国家经济社会发展作出了中国贡献。新形势下，高质量共建“一带一路”，可以从3个方面来理解和把握。
第一，共建“一带一路”进入高质量发展的新阶段。10多年来，共建“一带一路”从中国倡议走向国际实践，从“大写意”转向“工笔画”，在推进互联互通基础上拓展成为贸易和产业合作平台，成为全球规模最大、范围最广、影响最深的国际经济合作平台。发展战略对接长效机制基本形成，合作成果惠及150多个国家的人民；基础设施“硬联通”不断完善，基本形成陆海天网一体化互联互通格局，中老铁路总计开行旅客列车8万多列、发运旅客超过6250万人次，中欧班列累计开行突破12万列，“钱凯－上海”海上运输实现双向贯通；规则标准“软联通”不断深化，在共建国家间架起规则标准互联互通桥梁；同共建国家人民“心联通”日趋紧密，文化、旅游、教育等领域交流合作形式丰富，“小而美”项目帮助千家万户走上致富路，形成多元互动、百花齐放的人文交流格局。
第二，高质量共建“一带一路”面临新的国际形势。近年来，世界进入新的动荡变革期，单边主义、保护主义明显上升，局部冲突和动荡频发。在当前严峻复杂的国际环境下，推动共建“一带一路”高质量发展机遇和挑战并存，但总体上机遇大于挑战。置身于当前的世界环境，我们更加能够体会共建“一带一路”倡议提出的独到性和前瞻性，更加能够体会共建“一带一路”发展的重大成就和世界意义。面对新的形势，我们需要坚定战略自信，保持战略定力，勇于担当作为，妥善应对各种风险挑战，有效克服地缘冲突影响，正确处理增强共建国家获得感和坚持于我有利的关系，开创共建“一带一路”更加光明的未来，为推动构建人类命运共同体作出更大贡献。
第三，高质量共建“一带一路”需要把握好新的要求。以高质量共建“一带一路”八项行动为指引，以互联互通为主线，以推进体系化机制化为重点，坚持四个“相结合”和三个“统筹”，不断拓展更高水平、更具韧性、更可持续的共赢发展新空间。四个“相结合”即高质量发展和高水平安全相结合、政府引导和市场运作相结合、科学布局和动态优化相结合、量的增长和质的提升相结合；三个“统筹”即统筹深化基础设施“硬联通”、规则标准“软联通”和同共建国家人民“心联通”，统筹推进重大标志性工程和“小而美”民生项目建设，统筹巩固传统领域合作和稳步拓展新兴领域合作。立足新阶段、适应新形势，需要抓好以下重点。一是加强与共建国家发展战略、国际组织对接，强化合作规划统筹管理，夯实高质量共建“一带一路”的基础。二是完善立体互联互通网络布局，深化丝绸之路经济带和21世纪海上丝绸之路建设，畅通多元通道，加快西部陆海新通道建设，全面提升互联互通水平和重要通道支撑保障能力。三是全面提升务实合作质效，推进重大标志性工程和“小而美”民生项目协同增效，完善产业链供应链合作，提升中欧（亚）班列发展水平，拓展绿色发展、人工智能、数字经济、卫生健康、旅游、农业等领域合作，发挥重大国际合作平台支撑作用。四是统筹发展和安全，完善多元化、可持续、风险可控的投融资体系，加强风险防控和海外利益保护，推进高质量共建“一带一路”行稳致远。

新华社武汉12月29日电（记者张阳）2025年长江干线港口货物吞吐量预计超42亿吨，再创历史新高。这是记者从交通运输部长江航务管理局12月29日召开的新闻发布会上获悉的。
长江航务管理局初步测算，2025年长江干线港口货物吞吐量超42亿吨，同比增长4.8%，游轮客运量达885万人次，同比增长3.5%。“十四五”期间长江干线港口货物吞吐量超192亿吨，较“十三五”增长30.1%。
长江航务管理局副局长王建斌介绍说，近5年来，长江干线航道条件持续改善，亿吨大港从12个增加至18个，万吨级生产性泊位由360个增至487个。随着荆江航道整治二期工程主体完工和南京至芜湖段10.5米深水航道正式运行，大型船舶通航能力显著提升，长江黄金水道的战略通道功能将进一步增强。

记者手记｜2025：非洲大陆的中国印记
新华社记者许嘉桐
2025年，中非合作论坛步入成立25周年的历史性时刻。从共建“一带一路”的宏伟擘画，到真实亲诚理念的深入人心，从民相亲、心相通的深厚情谊，到共逐现代化的坚定步履，中非合作之路日益宽广。在广袤的非洲，记者深切感受到，合作赋能正让这片古老的大陆涌动出更大生机。
一株“幸福草”，点绿荒漠，温润人心。
今年是中国与毛里塔尼亚建交60周年。2025年6月，记者来到这个“沙漠之国”，记录中国菌草技术如何在此落地生根、造福一方。目之所及，菌草田郁郁葱葱。菌草既成为当地重要的饲草来源，也构筑起防风固沙的生态屏障。
喜悦，真切写在人们脸上。牧民阿米尔·阿卜杜的羊群从瘦骨嶙峋变得膘肥体壮。“多亏中国专家，我们终于能喂养好牲畜，日子有了盼头！”
在毛里塔尼亚首都努瓦克肖特周边，一位常来探望菌草园的老人说，她自幼未见过沙漠之外的世界，这片意外生长的绿意，宛如梦中的园圃。
在“千丘之国”卢旺达，菌草技术正悄然改变成千上万家庭的生活。当地青年莱昂尼达斯自福建农林大学学成归国后，带领团队利用菌草培育蘑菇，供应市场。看到当地孩子们开心食用蘑菇营养餐，记者更深切体会到“幸福草”所承载的期待。
一座体育场，筑梦基石，照亮前程。
在肯尼亚首都内罗毕的塔兰塔体育城建设一线，记者看到，夜幕虽深，工地却灯火通明，成百上千建设者昼夜轮班，全力以赴。
这座由中国企业承建、将作为2027年非洲杯主赛场之一的现代化体育综合体，自奠基之日便承载厚望。肯尼亚总统鲁托在视察开工现场时表示，这里将崛起一座世界级体育殿堂。
塔兰塔体育城建设故事系列短视频在社交平台发布后，网友留言：“中国始终以实际行动助力非洲建设”“感谢中国，期待更多合作佳音”。
塔兰塔体育城是中非合作的一帧缩影。2025年4月，鲁托在访华前夕接受新华社记者采访时说，蒙内铁路、拉穆港等重大基础设施合作项目不仅改善了肯尼亚国内的互联互通，也促进了东非地区的区域一体化和经济发展。
一场论坛会，心声共鸣，新程同启。
2025年11月，在南非约翰内斯堡，“全球南方”媒体智库高端论坛中非伙伴大会如期举行。会场内气氛热烈，媒体代表作为中非友谊的见证者与传递者，分享从东非辽阔草原到西非苍茫沙漠、从南部非洲繁荣社区至印度洋畔静谧村落的所见所闻所感。
在为期两天的会议中，来自中国和41个非洲国家的160余家主流媒体、智库、政府部门等机构和非盟的200余名代表围绕“全球治理变革中的中非担当”“全球南方振兴中的中非行动”和“全球文明共生中的中非交融”等议题展开深入交流。与会嘉宾纷纷表达对深化中非交流的热切期盼，称赞中国在团结“全球南方”推进现代化进程中的作用。
数据最有说服力。2024年，中非贸易额达2956亿美元，同比增长4.8%，连续第4年创历史新高。中国连续16年保持非洲第一大贸易伙伴国地位。同时，中国也是非洲最主要外资来源国之一。中方持续扩大对非开放，宣布对53个非洲建交国实施100%税目产品零关税……
回望2025年，这些被定格的瞬间表明，中非合作植根于共同的历史记忆，更指向携手奔赴的未来。展望前路，中国与非洲将继续携手，深耕厚植，为民生福祉，为和平繁荣。

题：开放合作互利共赢，中国为世界带来新机遇
新华社记者任军、有之炘、柴婷
高水平开放是促进中国与世界互利合作的“推进器”。
纵观2025年，中国积极对接国际高标准经贸规则，扩大服务业开放，外资准入负面清单进一步缩短，开放环境持续优化。
日前召开的中央经济工作会议把“坚持对外开放，推动多领域合作共赢”确定为明年我国经济工作的重点任务之一。
记者在调研中感受到，中国经济增长新动能不断涌现，外资抢抓高质量发展新机遇加码中国，外贸主体创新求变增强韧性。制度型开放稳步推进，为“引进来”与“走出去”注入更多活力，中国和世界双向奔赴，共创发展新机遇。
加快向新攀高 为投资中国打开新空间
江苏如皋，瑞典重卡品牌斯堪尼亚的工业生产基地内，数十名来自中瑞等国的工程师正紧锣密鼓开发测试重卡产品。
“中国在电气化、智能网联等领域的技术优势和研发速度能帮助斯堪尼亚更快实现创新突破。”斯堪尼亚亚洲研发负责人索尼娅·埃德斯托说，“我们在中国三地设有研发中心，工程师超600人，精准响应中国市场需求，并推动中国创新方案反哺全球。”
拜耳、阿斯利康、保时捷、强生……今年以来，越来越多跨国企业将中国视为全球创新的试验场、应用场、利润场，将规模庞大的研发中心、创新中心布局在中国。
今天的中国，产业升级在加快，绿色转型在推进，超大规模市场潜力在释放。瞄准这些新机遇，外资企业加快向中国市场更深处扎根。
在山西阳泉，西格里泉海高新材料（山西）有限公司正全力赶工特种石墨这一拳头产品。“石墨广泛应用于芯片、航空航天等产业。这些产业在中国蓬勃发展，为企业开辟了崭新发展空间。”总部位于德国的西格里碳素集团石墨材料生产运营负责人米沙说。
看好生成式AI带来的算力需求爆发前景，西门子12月发布“数据中心解决方案5.0”以及多款面向数据中心应用的直流配电新品；看好辅助驾驶的广阔市场空间，法国汽车零配件巨头法雷奥11月对浙江温岭工厂完成扩产，并增设摄像头雷达清洗装置生产线；看好中国城市更新和“好房子”建设的新蓝海，科德宝研发屋顶快速覆绿技术，将“灰色天际线”变身“绿色生态线”……
一组数据印证着中国对外资的引力：今年前11个月，中国新设立外商投资企业超6万家，同比增长16.9%；高技术产业实际使用外资2212.6亿元人民币，在实际使用外资总量中占比超三成。
擦亮“投资中国”品牌，落实好“准入又准营”，办好外企圆桌会……今年以来，多项服务举措继续深化，让外资愿意来、留得住、发展好。
“过去一年，到访中国的全球高管人数创历史新高。”麦肯锡全球资深董事合伙人泽沛达说，中国庞大的市场规模、向新的发展活力，将持续为洞悉增长潜力的跨国公司创造新机遇。
锻造外贸韧性 为全球发展注入稳定性
走进位于义乌国际商贸城的宏盛玩具店铺，满墙都是肤色配饰各异、会说各国语言的可爱洋娃娃。不大的店铺内，挤满了来自沙特和乌兹别克斯坦的两拨客商。
“今年的营业额较去年增长了一成多。日日有新款、3天内即可交付产品是我们生意红火的秘籍。”老板娘孙丽娟说，“现在每天都学习新本领。除了用AI进行产品设计，我们还用AI工具将产品介绍的视频翻译成多种语言，发给全球客户，大大提升了拓客效率。”
众多外贸主体的开拓创新，汇聚成了一条向上的曲线：2025年前11个月，我国货物贸易进出口总值41.21万亿元人民币，同比增长3.6%。
与此同时，我国与全球110多个国家和地区实现出口、进口同时增长，比去年同期增加20多个。
外贸“韧实力”，既来自完备产业体系支撑，也来自科技创新带来的蓬勃活力。面对异常复杂严峻的外部形势，我国外贸顶住压力，量质齐升，为全球经贸发展注入稳定性。
从秘鲁钱凯港出发，经由冷链快线，仅用23天跨越约17000公里直抵上海，随后发往全国——“佳沃秘鲁沙漠脆脆莓”在今年的进博会上亮相不久，便进入中国商超，端上百姓餐桌。“拉美比以往任何时候都渴望贸易和发展，而中国愿同我们合作。”秘鲁前驻华大使胡安·卡洛斯·卡普纳伊表示。
赞比亚的夏威夷果、哥伦比亚的鲜食香蕉……今年前三季度，中国新增了135种农食产品的准入，涉及50个国家和地区，更多全球好物叩开中国市场大门。
截至11月份，中国进口已连续6个月保持增长。12月1日，中国给予所有已建交的最不发达国家100%税目产品零关税待遇生效满一年。一年来，中国自最不发达国家进口规模累计增加550多亿元，助力全球南方共同发展。
通过进出口平衡发展，中国之需和世界之盼得到有效兼顾，合作共赢新空间进一步打开。
扩大自主开放 书写互利共赢新篇章
海南自贸港启动全岛封关运作后首周，一组新数据令人振奋：
12月18日至24日，海口海关共监管“一线”进口“零关税”享惠货物超4亿元；监管“二线”内销加工增值免关税货物超2000万元；封关首周，海南新增外贸备案企业1972家，同比增长2.3倍。
“高水平开放正牵引全球高端产业、资本、技术和人才要素集聚海南。”安永华南区主管合伙人黄寅说，“近期，我们收到的与海南自贸港相关的咨询业务显著增加，其中包括多家跨国公司。自贸港的全球引力正给安永带来新的增长空间。”
扩大自主开放是高水平开放的题中之义。2025年，一系列“栽桐引凤”制度型开放举措密集出台、贯穿全年——
《2025年稳外资行动方案》出台20项稳外资举措；《加快推进服务业扩大开放综合试点工作方案》明确155项试点任务；《关于实施自由贸易试验区提升战略的意见》对自贸试验区建设工作作出系统部署；继续扩大单方面免签国家范围；在全国范围内推广跨国公司本外币一体化资金池业务……
今年5月，太古旗下上海德达心血管医院作为全国首家外商独资心血管专科医院正式揭牌，全年门急诊量超8万人次。“我们清晰感受到中国推动高水平对外开放的决心。随着制度型开放向更深层次推进，太古将持续深耕中国市场。”太古中国区主席蒋意达说。
从经贸到科技领域，中国高举开放合作大旗：中国－东盟自贸区3.0版升级议定书签署，推动双方合作从“要素流动型开放”向“制度型开放”跃升；倡议成立世界人工智能合作组织，提出“人工智能+”国际合作倡议，推动人工智能成为造福人类的国际公共产品……
敞开大门、共享机遇，这是中国的坚定承诺和行动，必将为世界经济复苏与长期发展持续注入更强信心和更大动力。

新华社莫斯科12月28日电（记者侯鸣　刘恺）俄罗斯出口中心副总裁阿列克谢·索洛多夫近日接受新华社记者采访时表示，中国市场对俄罗斯至关重要，期待未来有更多俄罗斯产品进入中国市场。
索洛多夫说，中国市场对俄罗斯具有独特吸引力。近年来，俄罗斯出口中心与中国建立和发展多层次深度合作，俄罗斯对华出口持续增长。
索洛多夫表示，“俄罗斯制造”这一国家品牌已成为连接优质俄罗斯产品与中国消费者的“桥梁”。“为巩固这座‘桥梁’，今年我们在沈阳、哈尔滨和北京三个城市举办了‘俄罗斯制造’商品节活动。”索洛多夫说，为扩大影响力，今年还举办了相关线上活动。
他介绍，截至目前，消费者能在中国11个电商平台上的36家网店购买“俄罗斯制造”国家品牌产品。算上在零售店设立的专柜，在中国设立的线下商店总数已达249家。
索洛多夫说，目前已有超过2000家俄罗斯生产商获得“俄罗斯制造”国家认证证书，其中有约10%已进入中国市场，期待更多俄罗斯产品未来进入中国市场。

专访：中国不断为世界提供贸易和创新机遇——访英国48家集团名誉主席斯蒂芬·佩里
新华社记者吴黎明　郑博非
英国48家集团名誉主席斯蒂芬·佩里日前接受新华社记者专访时说，中国通过构建交通和贸易网络、扩大市场准入及持续创新实现了全球化路径，不断为世界提供贸易和创新机遇。
佩里认为，全球化是“世界经济发展的自然特征”，而非人为设计的政治产物。他说，历史上非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲的交通体系主要服务于殖民时期的资源输出，将内陆资源运往港口，却未能将各国彼此连接起来。正是中国“着手帮助这三大洲建立起能够让它们彼此开展贸易的交通系统”，才改变了原有的贸易结构。
佩里说，中国大部分的贸易最初都集中于北美和欧洲。随着中国不断扩大与亚洲、非洲等地的贸易往来，这一格局已经发生变化。
他认为，在共建“一带一路”框架下，中国修建的铁路和公路设施打通了过去难以实现的贸易线路，并对更广泛的全球市场开放这些通道。
佩里强调，中国在发展过程中没有进行军事力量扩张，也“没有把导弹指向世界各地”，而是通过“帮助世界发展来实现自身发展”。
在创新方面，佩里说，中国将在“各个领域持续创新”，并重构教育体系来适应未来技术发展需要，将大量高校教育内容转向新技术。
他认为，可通过欧中企业合资和共同持股等方式，缓解围绕电动汽车等先进技术的争端，欧洲企业需要重新思考自己的商业模式。“如果试图单方面主导亚洲或非洲，就会引发抵触。”
佩里表示，48家集团正重点推进机器人、人工智能等领域的对华合作，推动更多英国企业进入中国市场，同时鼓励中国企业在英国开展业务。
他说，关税和贸易壁垒会抑制长期投资、扰乱供应链，成为发展的障碍。年轻一代更倾向于走向世界、参与全球合作，而非“设置壁垒”。合作、创新以及共享型商业模式将定义下一阶段英中经贸关系的发展方向。

中企科威特新城“治水”记

科威特地处沙漠之中，常年高温、少雨、缺水。近日，记者到中建六局交通建设公司承建的南艾哈迈德新城基础设施项目采访时发现，当前该项目最重要的一项任务就是“治水”。
一是治“地下水”。新城濒临波斯湾，项目现场地下富含渗透进来的海水。据介绍，现场地面以下平均1—2米就是地下水。基槽一旦开挖，海水便汩汩冒出，并在潮汐作用下剧烈波动。积水最深处一度达到2.5米。进场初期，潮汐地下水一度让项目施工陷入停滞。
经过多方研究，项目最终摸索出了6套降水（降低水位）方案，分别运用于不同工况。为了保护周围的土壤及生态平衡，还采用了“地表回灌”措施：在降水管沟附近，用沙围出一个水池，收集泵站抽出的地下水；这些水通过地表慢慢渗入地下，实现地下水的平衡；渗透的余水则用于路基和管沟回填的拌和用水，也解决了沙漠地区取水难的问题。项目还建有一套小型海水淡化设备，将地下水处理后用于混凝土等要求淡水施工的部位。
在一处基槽施工现场，记者看到两台挖掘机正在作业。而几米之外，一堆沙土相隔，可见半米深的渗透水。项目总工程师杨贵虎说：“这个对比恰好说明，治理好地下水对施工至关重要。”
二是治“雨水”。科威特常年干旱，淡水资源极度匮乏。一旦下雨，这些雨水便是宝贵资源。同时，如果对降雨缺乏应对举措，沙漠城市往往会发生洪涝灾害。雨水的收集、储存并再次循环利用，是南艾哈迈德新城建设的重要内容。杨贵虎说，中方在设计和建设过程中充分借鉴了中国成熟的海绵城市技术。通过BIM（建筑信息模型）技术，进行地下管网的可视化建模，将新城区内的雨水系统和灌溉系统接通。先将雨水收集到水箱内，经过沉淀、过滤等处理后，再通过泵机组系统用于新城内绿化带、公园等的绿植灌溉。
据介绍，在南艾哈迈德新城建设中，中企将建设近7600个雨水收集单元、9个雨水处理转换系统，总计铺设超过264公里的雨水管道，拥有超过6.5万立方米的回收处理能力。一次蓄满水后可满足50亩绿植一年的灌溉用水量。科威特住房福利署质量工程师伊萨姆·贾柏尔表示：“中企建设的雨水收集系统将在一定程度上改善当地生态环境，缓解水资源短缺，为科威特居民营造更加绿色舒适的居住环境。”
三是治“污水”。生活污水的收集处理同样重要。项目2027年2月完工后，将至少为10万居民提供现代化的居住环境。项目在设计时就考虑将污水处理和再利用相结合。未来的生活污水经过沉淀处理后，将通过泵站泵送至绿化带处用作肥料，经过杀菌等处理的中水也将用于新城的灌溉系统。据介绍，项目总共将铺设超过260公里的污水管道，拥有超过5万立方米的回收处理能力。当前，项目现场有1400多人作业，营地日常产生大量生活污水。项目部引入中国污水净化设备，将工人生活区的污水经过处理后用于现场混凝土拌和、养护等。
面对3道“治水”难题，中企一一破解，展现出建设设计领域的硬核实力。科威特南艾哈迈德新城基础设施项目占地面积52.79平方公里。项目经理朱现刚表示，接下来，项目还将进一步建设变电站、电力通信以及社区道路等，中方将确保高质量履约、展示良好品牌形象。项目业主代表穆罕默德·阿巴斯说：“项目实施，将极大缓解艾哈迈德老城区的住房压力，中国企业在项目上的付出令人钦佩。”（记者 管克江）

新华丝路内罗毕12月27日电（记者李卓群）历经多年持续推进，由中国中工国际工程股份有限公司（下称“中工国际”）承建的肯尼亚国家电网升级工程——132千伏输电线路LOT1和LOT2项目全面建成并顺利送电。当地时间12月22日，肯尼亚总统威廉·鲁托在巴林戈郡卡巴尔内特变电站出席“莱索斯—卡巴尔内特”输电线路送电仪式并为项目剪彩，标志着肯尼亚北部及大裂谷地区电力基础设施建设取得重要进展。
该项目由中工国际于2019年4月与肯尼亚输电公司签署商务合同实施，是肯尼亚国家电网升级计划的重要组成部分。项目共涵盖5条132千伏输电线路建设，涉及182基铁塔基础施工、359基铁塔组立以及250公里以上输电线路架设和设备材料供货，工程分布于基图伊郡、纳库鲁郡、南迪郡、巴林戈郡和莱基皮亚郡等多个地区。
作为东非地区经济发展和人口增长较快的国家之一，肯尼亚近年来电力需求持续攀升，部分地区长期依赖电压等级较低、运行负荷较高的配电系统，供电稳定性和安全性面临挑战。推进主干电网升级、完善跨区域输电能力，成为保障民生用电、支撑产业发展和促进区域均衡发展的现实需要。
莱索斯—卡巴尔内特输电线路是此次项目中肯尼亚北部地区建成送电的关键线路。线路全长约65公里，以132千伏高压输电网络取代原有33千伏供电系统，显著提升了电网承载能力和运行可靠性。项目建成后，当地供电能力和电压质量明显改善，为区域长期发展提供了更加稳定的能源保障。
该工程的投运对改善民生具有直接意义。稳定电力为巴林戈郡及周边地区医疗机构提供了可靠能源支撑，有效保障手术、急救、妇幼保健、疫苗冷链等医疗服务安全运行；同时也为学校、供水设施和公共服务体系的稳定运转创造了条件，提升了居民生活质量。
在产业层面，电力条件改善有助于降低中小企业和农产品加工企业用能成本，增强生产连续性和市场竞争力，为当地咖啡、乳制品、棉花、水果等特色产业的规模化加工和价值提升提供基础支撑，推动就业增长和收入改善。
从国家能源结构和区域互联互通角度看，莱索斯—卡巴尔内特输电线路还将与规划中的“卡巴尔内特—鲁穆鲁蒂”等输电工程衔接，进一步完善肯尼亚北部及中部电网结构，为地热、水电、风电等清洁能源并网和跨区域输送创造条件，有助于提升清洁能源利用水平，增强国家电网整体稳定性和调度能力。
除该项目外，中工国际目前还在肯尼亚推进多项电力和基础设施工程。其中，位于沿海地区的马里亚卡尼400千伏变电站项目是肯尼亚国家主干电网的重要节点，建成后将显著提升沿海地区电力输送和调度能力，为港口物流、工业园区和城市发展提供能源保障。
业内人士认为，随着上述项目陆续建成投运，肯尼亚电力基础设施的承载能力和覆盖水平将持续提升，为经济增长、产业升级和区域协调发展提供更加坚实的能源支撑，也为中肯在基础设施和可持续发展领域深化合作注入新动能。

新华社达累斯萨拉姆／马普托12月23日电（记者华洪立 林光耀 刘杰）在坦桑尼亚达累斯萨拉姆中央车站，20世纪70年代修建的站房依然保持着旧有外观，站台旁停着老式柴油机车。不少机车已超过设计寿命，只能依靠拆旧件维持运行。如何让一条运行近半个世纪的铁路焕发更大活力？一场系统性行动正悄然展开。
在赞比亚中央省的新卡皮里姆波希车站轨道上，工人们用套筒扳手、撬棍等工具，将一颗颗钢轨扣件、道钉卸下，移开铁轨，工程师斯坦利·西穆希告诉记者：“我们正在给站内一段轨道更换新的枕木。”
今年11月，坦赞铁路激活项目进入全面施工阶段。不久后，这条承载着历史荣光的中非“友谊之路”将焕然一新，重新投入使用，续写合作共赢新篇章。

打造高质量共建标杆
坦赞铁路全长1860.5公里，东起坦桑尼亚港口城市达累斯萨拉姆，西至赞比亚的新卡皮里姆波希，由中国政府提供无息贷款援建。1976年7月，这条铁路正式移交给坦、赞两国政府运营。
坦赞铁路由三国老一辈领导人共同缔造，承载着深厚友谊和共同追求，被誉为“自由之路”和“友谊之路”。在当时极为艰苦的条件下，中国派出数万工程人员，数百名中、坦、赞建设者为此献出生命。对坦桑尼亚和赞比亚来说，它不仅是一条出海通道，更是国家独立和区域互助的象征。
运营49年来，坦赞铁路累计运送货物3000多万吨、运载旅客4000多万人次，成为保障坦赞两国及周边国家经济运行的“大动脉”。近些年来，即便在运力有限、班次减少的情况下，坦赞铁路仍发挥着服务民生的作用。它不仅是沿线民众的日常出行选择，聚集在一个个中小站点附近的食品小贩、搬运工、杂货摊、修理铺，构成了当地微型经济生态。

近年来，设备老化、管理机制滞后等原因限制了坦赞铁路货运能力，而区域经济发展与物流需求日益增长。在此背景下，坦赞铁路的现代化改造被提上议事日程。2024年，中、坦、赞三方启动了铁路系统性升级的前期调研，计划在轨道、信号、牵引供电、车辆等方面进行全链条提升，使坦赞铁路成为面向印度洋的长期稳定出海走廊。
2025年11月20日，国务院总理李强在赞比亚首都卢萨卡同赞比亚总统希奇莱马、坦桑尼亚副总统恩钦比共同出席坦赞铁路激活项目开工仪式，为这条老铁路的再出发按下“启动键”。李强指出，中方将同坦桑尼亚和赞比亚一道，把项目打造成优质高效、安全可靠的精品工程，树立高质量共建“一带一路”的标杆，并以此为契机推进铁路、公路、港口等基础设施“硬联通”，加强海关、商检、税务等领域“软联通”，不断提升贸易和投资便利化水平，促进中坦赞之间、中非之间的市场、产业融合对接。
在坦桑尼亚国家博物馆最近举办的一个关于坦赞铁路的活动上，记者见到曾参与铁路建设的退休工人、73岁的索罗蒙·姆瓦卡桑加。他直言铁路老化严重、速度偏低，已影响区域货运能力，许多货主不得不转向成本更高的公路运输。他对铁路激活项目寄予厚望：“铁路升级后，青年有工作、农民能卖货、企业敢投资。它不仅是一条铁路，更是未来。”

为发展注入新动能
非洲物流成本远高于世界平均水平，在基础设施领域存在大量投资缺口。坦赞铁路激活项目有助于非洲弥补基建赤字，提升整体运力，同时降低内陆国家矿产出海成本，助推非洲更紧密地融入全球经济。
随着激活项目的推进，坦赞铁路货运能力预计将提升至每年240万吨，货物运输时间或将缩短近三分之二。
不仅如此，根据三国联合声明，中、坦、赞将携手推动建设坦赞铁路繁荣带，释放区域发展潜力，助力坦、赞两国工业化和农业现代化，改善沿线百姓民生福祉。
安哥拉天主教大学教授威尔逊·内韦斯表示，随着非洲国家稳步推进区域一体化，“非洲希望在产业、技术、就业和能力建设方面加强与外界合作”。在他看来，在互惠互利的伙伴关系下，交通干线改造不仅关乎提升物流能力，更有望引领区域经济发展走上快车道。
北京大学非洲研究中心副秘书长王进杰指出，中非基础设施合作正从“重建设”向“重运营、重治理、重可持续”转型。从援建项目走向共同运营的经济走廊，既关乎坦赞铁路自身能否用得久，也关乎未来中非相关领域合作模式能否实现迭代升级。

在此次改造中，三方在坦赞铁路沿线规划布局物流枢纽、工业园区，叠加加工制造、农业冷链、仓储和各类生产性服务，以带动周边区域发展。同时，为保障铁路能实现商业化可持续运营，还配套设立培训中心、职教项目以及现代化的公司治理与监管框架。
达累斯萨拉姆大学中国研究中心主任汉弗莱·莫希接受记者采访时说，坦赞铁路现代化不是一般意义上的项目升级，而是在东非乃至整个非洲大陆格局加速演变背景下的一次战略性再定位。他表示，坦赞铁路历史久远、深得民心、沿线产业链较完整、与中国在东非的其他项目可形成联动，这条经济走廊前景广阔，未来有望成为东非制造业和贸易的主轴。
莫希说，坦桑尼亚希望重新成为区域枢纽，赞比亚希望降低物流成本、提高出口稳定性，中国希望与非洲汇聚更大发展合力，“三方目标高度一致，这就是坦赞铁路现代化的最大前景与底气所在”。

中老铁路是中国和老挝互利合作的旗舰项目，自2021年12月开通运营以来累计发送旅客超6250万人次，运输货物超7250万吨。中老铁路线路运营、人才培养、沿线开发齐头并进，货物贸易、互联互通、人文交流相互促进，成为中国与老挝及东南亚地区互联互通的“黄金大通道”，为区域经济社会发展注入了新活力。记者近日实地探访中老铁路老挝段（以下简称“老挝段”），记录下中老铁路的昼夜轮转。
7时，万象火车站候车大厅——
取票窗口前排起了长队，旅客早早等候在检票口
晨光初绽，周边早餐摊升腾的烟火气，唤醒了沉睡一夜的万象火车站。站前广场车水马龙、人流如织，站内取票窗口前早早排起了长队。
老挝农业环境部农业司植物检验检疫处处长维安佩·万西拉隆通过安检，在候车大厅内坐下，将携带的公文包放在一旁。“我去琅勃拉邦出差，晚上就能回来，这在以前想都不敢想。”维安佩说，自己乘坐的D88次列车8时发车，到琅勃拉邦只需不到2小时。
出于工作需要，维安佩经常到老挝北部地区出差。老挝北部多山、公路难行，雨季路况更是复杂多变。“老中铁路开通前，从万象开车到琅勃拉邦需要6到8个小时，到更北的孟赛需要12到14个小时，到与中国云南接壤的丰沙里省更需要近两天。”维安佩表示，铁路开通后，路上时间大幅缩短，“不再疲于奔波，让我能更专注于工作。”
过去4年，作为一名中老铁路的常客，维安佩见证了老挝铁路系统的发展。“如今旅客广播、进站引导等服务体系不断完善，老中铁路日益融入老挝民众的生活，成为普通人便捷出行的重要选择。”维安佩说。
每年11月至次年4月是老挝的旅游旺季，老挝段旅客列车几乎都处于满载状态。伴随着催促进站的广播声，维安佩的背影淹没在人群中。
8时，D88次列车车厢内——
旅游旺季乘车游客众多，列车长忙得不亦乐乎
8时，D88次列车准点自万象站发出，一路向北驶去。

中老铁路串联起老挝的万荣、琅勃拉邦和中国云南的西双版纳、普洱、玉溪、昆明等知名旅游城市。这是世界上旅游资源最丰富、气候带最完整、物种资源最富集、生态文化保存最原始、世界遗产最集中的区域之一。“最近跑跨境列车，游客特别多，忙得不亦乐乎。”列车长温雅笑着说，看到越来越多游客乘坐自己服务的列车，她感到由衷高兴。
据老挝文化旅游部统计，今年前三季度，老挝共接待336.9万名外国游客，较去年同期增长15%。老挝文化旅游部部长苏莎婉·维亚吉表示，老中铁路不仅提升了老挝万象、琅勃拉邦、乌多姆赛和琅南塔等北部地区交通便利程度，还极大促进了旅游业的发展，成为促进区域互联互通的关键纽带。

老挝琅勃拉邦省文化和旅游厅厅长苏达彭·空塔翁介绍，目前赴琅勃拉邦的游客中，87%选择经由铁路抵达。“昔日的交通不便让很多国际旅客望而却步，如今借由老中铁路，大家可以便捷地探访琅勃拉邦，感受这里独特的历史文化魅力。旅游业的繁荣也为城市发展带来了巨大动力。”苏达彭说。
“我们将以铁路为核心纽带，进一步深化区域旅游合作，推动跨境出行便利化政策，在主要车站设立多语种旅游服务中心，为国际旅客提供更高品质的服务。”苏莎婉说，今年以来，为了更好地服务“跨境游”，老中铁路万象运营管理中心针对部分旅客听不懂老、中、英3种语言的实际情况，增加了其他语言服务，形成了“3+N”语言服务体系。9月1日起，老挝段还正式启用了客运服务热线，提供老、中、英、泰4种语言支持，方便旅客咨询列车时刻、票务办理、遗失物品查找等。
“请大家尽快找到自己的座位就座！”9时50分，D88次列车驶离琅勃拉邦站，温雅一边维持着车内秩序，一边协助刚上车的旅客放好行李。
12时，琅勃拉邦站站台——
畅通人员物资运输通道，支撑紧急救援“生命线”
D88次列车驶过没多久，琅勃拉邦站站台又热闹起来。作为中老铁路的热门站点，老挝段目前开行的各次列车均停靠琅勃拉邦站。
中午时分，两名工作人员推着担架车等候在进站口旁，准备护送一名患有疑难病症的旅客上车。这名患者将乘坐C91次列车前往万象接受诊治。列车长维安孔·维莱蓬正与车站客运员核对相关情况，确保顺利转运。胸前佩戴的名牌上写着她的中文名“王诗瑶”。4年前，她从广西民族师范学院毕业后，来到中老铁路工作。

中老铁路是老挝重要的紧急医疗救援和物资输送通道，也是急病旅客和受灾群众的“生命线”，应对突发状况是每一名列车员和列车长的必备技能。4年来，在当地多次台风和洪灾中，中老铁路将急救人员和急需物资及时送抵灾区，为应对突发灾情提供了关键支撑。中老铁路还完成了数百起紧急医疗救援任务，其中包括每年约10起跨境重症旅客转运，以及年均超百起的老挝境内突发疾病救助。
“2023年2月的一天，天气很热，一名旅客突然感到呼吸困难、没有力气，我发现后立即向列车长报告了情况。”王诗瑶回忆起自己还是列车员时，第一次在列车上照顾突发急病旅客时的情形，“我们马上给他拿来了提神药、饮用水和扇子，守在旁边密切监测他的情况。10多分钟后他逐渐好转，我也松了一口气。”事后，那名旅客给王诗瑶和她的同事写了一封感谢信，“我们收到时开心极了。”
今年11月初，王诗瑶成为C91次列车的列车长。从第一天上班时的紧张无措到今天的游刃有余，王诗瑶的成长与发展深深感染着亲朋好友，她的表妹也成功应聘，成为今年老中铁路有限公司新入职的300余名老方员工之一。
老中铁路有限公司人力资源部部长张铁翅表示，很多新员工都是受家人的影响来到铁路工作的，目前老挝段当地员工占比已超67%，“我们将给当地员工提供更多赴华培训名额等，培养有一线经验、懂管理、具备国际化视野的老挝铁路人才。”
18时，万象机辆运用检修车间——
中老司机“传帮带”显成效，人才梯队建设加速推进
夜幕降临，街灯亮起，下班回家的车辆挤满了万象的大街小巷。万象机辆运用检修车间内，仍然一派繁忙景象。“月度重点管控风险”“车间重点工作”等中老双语信息在车间大屏幕上不停闪烁。4层小教室灯火通明，中老双方的火车司机正在召开晚间学习会。
讲台上，两名培训教师分别用中文和老挝语讲解当天的重点知识，随后立即进行测验。“每天晚上一个小时的学习会雷打不动，这是火车司机岗位安全责任所要求的。”中方火车司机浦晨说。
浦晨参与值乘老挝段开行的全部“澜沧号”动车组列车，旺季时经常需要连续值乘5到6天。每个工作日，他都会提前两小时到达客车整备所，与班组一起对当日值乘任务进行核对，并预判可能出现的突发情况。之后，他会与维保人员一道，对全列动车组的设施设备等进行全面检查，确保机车运行状态良好、动车组安全出库。
“我是第二批承担中老铁路值乘任务的中方火车司机，2023年3月正式到任。”浦晨到任的次月，中老铁路国际旅客列车正式开行，如今已有每日两趟客运列车往返于昆明和万象。“两年多来，车站沿线盖起了新砖房、兴起了新商圈，老挝百姓从对铁路充满好奇到熟练地乘车出行，地区货物、人员往来日益密切……”浦晨细数铁路通车带来的变化。
由于老方火车司机人才梯队尚在建设阶段，老挝段动车组旅客列车由中方司机作为主驾驶，但已有两批老方火车司机取得机车驾驶证并独立值乘货运列车，为下一步独立值乘动车组旅客列车积累经验。“老方火车司机认真、努力，其中一些已能独立值乘动车组，下一步会着重培养他们应对突发状况的能力。”浦晨介绍，中老铁路正在启动培养第三批老挝籍火车司机，预计到2026年，老挝籍司机将达到54人。
晚间学习会开始前，第一批老方火车司机刘银能谈起自己近期赴中国河南郑州、广西南宁参加培训的见闻：“我这次见到了很多厉害的人，向他们学到了很多东西。我觉得自己的工作很有意义，保障货物、旅客安全是我的责任和使命。”
21时，琅勃拉邦维保管理中心——

21时，随着从磨丁站始发的C81次列车抵达万象火车站，老挝段客运结束了一天的运营，但维保管理中心的工作才刚刚开始。
老挝北部山区入夜后凉风习习，几名线路工穿戴好防护设备，携带维修工具登上轨道车，沿铁轨对轨道线路进行日常检修维护。“每周二到周五，线路都要进行夜间维护。”琅勃拉邦维保管理中心综合安置部老方员工胡明强说。
胡明强2017年毕业于老挝国立大学，2022年入职中老铁路担任线路工，负责道岔、股道、线路检查维修。“虽然我之前学过一点中文，但铁路的专业术语和技术知识完全不懂，入门非常困难。”胡明强说，由于老挝以前没有标准轨铁路，“钢轨”“道岔”“接触网”等铁路专业术语在老挝语中没有对应的翻译，老方员工4年来都是使用中文专业术语进行沟通。“中国师父一直非常耐心地教我们线路养护技术，作为老挝第一代线路工，我一定要把这条铁路维护好。”

今年7月，胡明强晋升管理岗位，管理琅勃拉邦维保管理中心的300多名老方员工，但他依旧在夜间奔赴线路检修现场督导工作。“铁路线路在不同季节的养护重点不同，雨季需要预防洪涝灾害和泥石流，旱季则需防火。”胡明强说，“我越来越体会到这份工作对保障铁路安全稳定运行的重要意义。”看到他在铁路上工作得踏实、生活越过越好，家里的4个兄弟也陆续来应聘，如今都在中老铁路的维修一线工作，共同保障货物运输和旅客乘车安全。
交谈间，一列货运班列从琅勃拉邦火车站缓缓驶过，满载着老挝、泰国等东南亚国家的铁矿石、橡胶等工业原料驶向中国。线路工们在货车通过的间隙，抓紧对线路进行维护，以迎接中老铁路新一天的繁忙运行。

今年，中老铁路“一地两检”政府间协议正式签署；老挝首批鲜芒果经中老铁路输华；纳磨站正式实现由老挝员工独立管理运营……“硬联通”“软联通”同步推进，“心联通”水到渠成。中老两国山同脉、水同源，双方正以中老铁路运营和沿线开发为抓手，持续拓展“黄金大通道”辐射带动效应，推动重点项目提质升级，将中老铁路打造成为中老人民的幸福路、发展路、友谊路，更好造福两国和地区人民。（记者杨一，苏朋参与采写）

上海海关12月5日公布，在“钱凯－上海”海运航线双向贯通即将迎来一周年之际，这条海运航线的进出口货值已突破50亿元人民币。截至4日达53.5亿元，进出口货物达19.7万吨。“钱凯－上海”海运航线促进了中国与拉美对外贸易的“双向奔赴”。
海关统计显示，“钱凯－上海”海运航线开通后，中国与秘鲁两国间进出口货物的海运时间从过去的35－40天缩短至23天，相关进出口商品的物流成本节约20%以上。今年前10个月，上海对秘鲁进出口货值比去年同期增长47.1%，“钱凯－上海”海运航线正成为中国秘鲁两国乃至中国与拉美国家之间一条重要的经济走廊。
今年7月，首批1300多辆国产汽车自上海南港码头直航秘鲁钱凯港。截至11月底，自上海南港发往钱凯港的国产汽车已达5948辆。

中欧班列中通道年内通行量首次突破3500列

记者从中国铁路呼和浩特局集团有限公司获悉，11月20日，一列中欧班列满载55个集装箱从内蒙古二连浩特铁路口岸鸣笛启程驶向俄罗斯，标志着今年中欧班列中通道通行量突破3500列。这也是二连浩特铁路口岸自2013年通行中欧班列以来，首次年内突破3500列大关，创历史新高。
据了解，二连浩特铁路口岸今年先后增加“芜湖-莫斯科”“大同-谢利亚季诺”等中欧班列运行线路，目前运行中欧班列线路达74条，通达德国、波兰等10余个国家70多个枢纽站点。
随着跨境运输需求持续增长，二连浩特铁路口岸中欧班列开行方向、数量、货物品类等方面均呈现持续增长态势，已连续3年年内突破3000列，累计通行中欧班列超2.1万列。

“我们的运输货物品类也在不断升级，运输货物从最初的金属、化工、服装鞋帽为主，逐步转变为现在以新能源汽车、电子产品、家用电器等高附加值产品为主。”国铁呼和浩特局二连站货运交接所主任武树军介绍。
此外，为进一步提升中欧班列的运行效率和服务质量，国铁呼和浩特局还依托95306“数字口岸”系统持续推进无纸化通关，加强与海关、边检等部门信息互联互通，不断创新监管模式、优化查验流程，提升全程运输效率，中欧班列通关时间同比缩短5%以上。（记者侯维轶）

2026年1月1日，国家主席习近平向瑞士新任联邦主席帕姆兰致贺电，祝贺他就任瑞士联邦主席。
习近平指出，2017年我对瑞士进行国事访问期间，两国宣布启动自贸协定升级联合研究。在帕姆兰主席推动下，协定升级谈判取得积极进展。当前，单边主义、保护主义抬头，两国携手支持自由贸易，是中瑞关系高水平发展的真实写照，也为世界发展繁荣注入更多确定性和稳定性。2026年是中瑞建立创新战略伙伴关系10周年，也是中国“十五五”规划开局之年，两国创新合作面临广阔机遇。我高度重视中瑞关系发展，愿同帕姆兰主席一道努力，持续扩大互利合作，推动中瑞关系不断迈上新台阶，更好造福两国人民。

国家主席习近平发表二〇二六年新年贺词

新年前夕，国家主席习近平通过中央广播电视总台和互联网，发表了二〇二六年新年贺词。全文如下：
大家好！岁序更替，华章日新。在新年到来之际，我在北京向大家致以美好的祝福！
2025年是“十四五”收官之年。5年来，我们踔厉奋发、勇毅前行，克服重重困难挑战，圆满完成目标任务，在中国式现代化新征程上迈出了稳健步伐。我国经济总量连续跨越新关口，今年预计达到140万亿元，经济实力、科技实力、国防实力、综合国力跃上新台阶，绿水青山成为亮丽底色，人民群众获得感幸福感安全感不断增强。5年历程极不寻常，成绩来之不易。大家拼搏进取、耕耘奉献，铸就了欣欣向荣的中国。我向每一位辛勤付出的奋斗者致敬！
这一年，令人难忘的是，我们隆重纪念中国人民抗日战争暨世界反法西斯战争胜利80周年，设立台湾光复纪念日。国之盛典威武雄壮，胜利荣光永载史册，激励中华儿女铭记历史、缅怀先烈、珍爱和平、开创未来，凝聚起中华民族伟大复兴的磅礴伟力。
我们依靠创新为高质量发展赋能。科技与产业深度融合，创新成果竞相涌现，人工智能大模型你追我赶，芯片自主研发有了新突破，我国成为创新力上升最快的经济体之一。天问二号开启“追星”之旅，雅下水电工程开工建设，首艘电磁弹射型航母正式入列。人形机器人亮出“功夫模式”，无人机演绎绚丽“烟花”。创新创造催生了新质生产力，也让生活更加多姿多彩。
我们以文化滋养精神家园。文博热、非遗热不断升温，世界遗产再添新员，悟空和哪吒风靡全球，古韵国风成为年轻人眼中的“顶流审美”。文旅市场人气火爆，“城超”“村超”热闹非凡，冰雪运动点燃冬日激情。传统与现代交融，中华文化绽放更加灿烂的光芒。
我们共创共享美好生活。我到西藏、新疆出席庆祝活动，从雪域高原到天山南北，各族群众心手相连，像石榴籽一样紧紧抱在一起，大家用洁白的哈达、热情的歌舞，表达对祖国的热爱、对幸福的礼赞。民生无小事，枝叶总关情。过去一年，新就业群体权益有了进一步保障，适老化改造给老年人带来方便，育儿家庭每月多了300元补贴。柴米油盐、三餐四季，每个“小家”热气腾腾，中国这个“大家”就蒸蒸日上。
我们继续敞开胸怀拥抱世界。上合组织天津峰会、全球妇女峰会成功举办，海南自贸港全岛封关运作。为更好应对气候变化，我国宣布新一轮国家自主贡献。继“三大倡议”之后，我提出全球治理倡议，推动建设更加公正合理的全球治理体系。当今世界变乱交织，一些地区仍被战火笼罩。中国始终站在历史正确一边，愿同各国携手促进世界和平发展，推动构建人类命运共同体。
前不久，我出席了全运会开幕式，粤港澳三地同心同行，令人欣慰。要坚定不移贯彻“一国两制”方针，支持港澳更好融入国家发展大局，保持长期繁荣稳定。两岸同胞血浓于水，祖国统一的历史大势不可阻挡！
党兴方能国强。我们开展深入贯彻中央八项规定精神学习教育，徙木立信从严管党治党，去腐生肌推进自我革命，党风政风持续向好。要砥砺初心使命，持之以恒、久久为功，继续回答好延安“窑洞之问”，书写无愧于人民的时代答卷。
2026年是“十五五”开局之年。锐始者必图其终，成功者先计于始。我们要锚定目标任务，坚定信心、乘势而上，扎实推动高质量发展，进一步全面深化改革开放，推进全体人民共同富裕，续写中国奇迹新篇章。
山海寻梦，不觉其远；前路迢迢，阔步而行。让我们拿出跃马扬鞭的勇气，激发万马奔腾的活力，保持马不停蹄的干劲，一起为梦想奋斗、为幸福打拼，把宏伟愿景变成美好现实。
新年的旭日即将升起。祝祖国山河壮丽、大地丰饶，神州沐朝晖！祝大家心有所悦、业有所成，万事皆可期！

2025年12月5日，国家主席习近平在四川省成都市都江堰同法国总统马克龙进行友好交流。
初冬的都江堰，苍山掩翠。马克龙夫妇抵达时，受到习近平和彭丽媛热情迎接。习近平欢迎马克龙到访“天府之国”，表示去年你邀请我赴你的家乡上比利牛斯省，相信你此行会进一步丰富对中国的认知。
两国元首夫妇沿堰功道边走边谈。
习近平介绍都江堰历史和意义，指出都江堰水利工程是全世界迄今唯一仍在使用的古代水利工程，也是人类与自然和谐共生最早的成功实践之一，修建过程充分反映了中华民族自强不息、不畏艰难、勇于开拓的精神。每次来到都江堰都能感受到先人因地制宜、顺势而为、天人合一、治水利民的伟大，从中汲取到治国理政的智慧。法兰西民族同样具有坚韧不拔的精神。中法两国应该比其他国家更能够相互理解、相互尊重。
马克龙表示，都江堰山清水秀、景色优美。两千多年前建成的水利工程至今仍在发挥作用，中国人民的勤劳智慧令人赞叹。法中两国都有悠久的历史文化，两国人民对美好生活的追求是相通的，法中合作可以共谋发展繁荣、造福两国人民。
两国元首夫妇落座怀古亭，临水品茗，纵论天下。
习近平强调，国家强盛、民族复兴需要物质文明的积累，也需要精神文明的升华。有文化自信的民族，才能立得住、站得稳、行得远。中华文明是世界上唯一绵延不断且以国家形态发展至今的伟大文明，具有突出的连续性、创新性、统一性、包容性、和平性。中法两国分别是东西方文明的杰出代表。两国共有的独立自主精神，就源于各自深厚的文化底蕴。中法建交不仅是两个独立自主国家的“握手”，也是两大璀璨文明的交汇。面对变乱交织的国际形势，相信中法两个历史文化大国能够通过对话合作，共同为世界和平稳定和人类发展进步作出更大贡献。
马克龙说，当前国际形势迅速演变，充满不确定性。法方愿同中方加强沟通协调，坚持通过对话协商解决冲突，携手维护世界和平稳定。
习近平夫妇邀请马克龙夫妇共进午餐，继续深入交流。
两国元首一致同意保持密切沟通，共同推动中法全面战略伙伴关系不断向前发展。
访问期间，双方就加强全球治理、合作应对全球气候和环境挑战、持续推进和平利用核能领域合作、农业和食品交流与合作、乌克兰局势和巴勒斯坦局势发表了联合声明。
王毅参加上述活动。

2025年12月4日中午，国家主席习近平在北京同法国总统马克龙共同出席中法企业家委员会第七次会议闭幕式并致辞。
习近平指出，今年是中法关系“新甲子”的开局之年。两国经贸合作领域不断拓展、韧性不断增强。前10个月，双边贸易额达到687.5亿美元，双向投资额累计超过270亿美元。双方要秉持建交初心，抓住机遇、深化合作，推动两国关系行稳致远，共同谱写中法合作更加美好的篇章，以中法关系的稳定性应对当今世界的不确定性。
一是不断拓展双边经贸合作新领域。中方视法方为重要的、不可或缺的经贸合作伙伴，欢迎法方积极参与中国式现代化进程，支持有实力、有意愿的中方企业赴法投资兴业。双方要挖掘人工智能、绿色和数字经济、生物医药、银发经济等新兴领域合作潜力，持续推动产业链供应链开放合作，为两国企业提供公平、透明、非歧视、可预期的营商环境。
二是继续推动中欧互利合作新发展。今年是中欧建交50周年。中欧经贸关系的本质是优势互补、互利共赢，完全能够在发展中实现动态平衡。相互依赖不是风险，利益交融不是威胁。中法双方要推动中欧坚持全面战略伙伴关系定位，共创中欧关系更加光明的下一个50年。
三是共同为改革完善全球治理作出新贡献。今年是世界反法西斯战争胜利和联合国成立80周年。为了推动构建更加公正合理的全球治理体系，继全球发展倡议、全球安全倡议、全球文明倡议后，今年9月我提出全球治理倡议。中法两国要践行真正的多边主义，共同维护联合国地位和权威，维护以世界贸易组织为核心、以规则为基础的多边贸易体制，为改革完善全球治理贡献正能量。
习近平强调，中共二十届四中全会审议通过了“十五五”规划建议。中国将全面推进中国式现代化，扩大高水平对外开放。欢迎法国企业家继续共享中国发展红利。
中法两国政府、企业等各界代表约150人参加闭幕式。
王毅参加上述活动。

2025年12月4日上午，国家主席习近平同法国总统马克龙会谈后共同会见记者。
习近平指出，欢迎马克龙总统对中国进行第四次国事访问。我们进行了友好坦诚、富有成果的会谈。双方一致认为，中法同为独立自主大国，面对当前变乱交织的国际形势，应当高举多边主义旗帜，坚持平等对话、开放合作，充分彰显中法全面战略伙伴关系的战略价值和世界影响，推动平等有序的世界多极化、普惠包容的经济全球化。我们一致同意做好以下4个方面工作：
一是增进政治互信。无论外部环境如何变化，始终展现大国的独立自主和战略眼光，在涉及彼此核心利益和重大关切问题上相互理解、相互支持。
二是拓展务实合作。巩固航空、航天、核能等传统领域合作，拓展绿色经济、数字经济、生物医药、人工智能等新兴领域合作。推动双边经贸关系平衡发展，扩大双向投资，为两国企业提供公平、透明、非歧视、可预期的营商环境。
三是促进人文交流。在去年成功举办文化旅游年的基础上，深化文化、教育、科技、地方等领域交流合作，开展新一轮大熊猫保护合作。
四是推动改革完善全球治理。加强战略沟通和协作，维护以联合国为核心的国际体系和以国际法为基础的国际秩序，推动全球治理体系朝着更加公正合理的方向发展。
习近平指出，当今世界很不太平，国际政治纷争和冲突多点爆发、复杂难解。关于乌克兰危机问题，中方支持一切致力于和平的努力，希望各方通过对话谈判达成公平、持久、有约束力并被当事各方所接受的和平协议。中方将继续为危机政治解决发挥建设性作用，同时坚决反对任何不负责任的甩锅、抹黑行为。中法双方将共同努力，推动巴勒斯坦问题早日得到全面、公正、持久解决。中方将向巴勒斯坦提供1亿美元援助，用于缓解加沙人道主义危机，支持加沙恢复与重建。
习近平强调，对外开放是中国的基本国策，中国开放的大门只会越开越大。“十五五”期间，中国将以全面深化改革推动高质量发展，深入实施扩大内需战略，扩大市场准入和开放领域，还将引导产业链供应链合理有序跨境布局。这将为中法务实合作和中法关系发展开辟更广阔空间。中国愿同法国一道，共促发展、共筑和平、共赢未来，朝着构建人类命运共同体方向不断迈进。
王毅出席上述活动。

2025年12月4日上午，国家主席习近平在北京人民大会堂同来华进行国事访问的法国总统马克龙举行会谈。
习近平指出，中法都是有远见、有担当的独立自主大国，是推动世界多极化、促进人类团结合作的建设性力量。当前，百年变局加速演进，人类又一次站在何去何从的十字路口。中法两国应当展现责任担当，高举多边主义旗帜，坚定站在历史正确一边。中方愿同法方一道，始终从两国人民根本利益和国际社会长远利益出发，坚持平等对话、开放合作，让中法全面战略伙伴关系在“新甲子”走得更稳更好，充分彰显其战略价值，为推动平等有序的世界多极化、普惠包容的经济全球化作出新的贡献。
习近平强调，无论外部环境如何变化，中法两国都应当始终展现大国的战略眼光和独立自主，在彼此核心利益和重大关切问题上相互理解和支持，维护好中法关系的政治基础。中共二十届四中全会审议通过“十五五”规划建议，为未来5年中国发展擘画蓝图，也向世界提供了一份“机遇清单”。中法两国要抓住机遇，拓展合作空间，巩固航空、航天、核能等传统领域合作，挖掘绿色经济、数字经济、生物医药、人工智能、新能源等领域合作潜力。中方愿进口更多法国优质产品，欢迎更多法国企业来华发展，也希望法方为中国企业提供公平环境和稳定预期。中法两国人民有着天然亲近感，要深化文化、教育、科技、地方等领域交流合作，续写人文交流精彩篇章。
习近平强调，当今世界很不太平，热点问题多点爆发、复杂难解。中法同为联合国创始成员国和安理会常任理事国，应当践行真正的多边主义，维护以联合国为核心的国际体系和以国际法为基础的国际秩序，就政治解决争端、促进世界和平稳定加强沟通和协作，推动改革完善全球治理。当前，世界存在南北发展不平衡、发展中国家在国际金融机构中代表性不足等很多不平衡问题，各国应当共担责任、协调行动，携手推动全球经济治理更加公平、公正、合理。中欧50年来的交往合作互利共赢、成就彼此。各国产供链深度互嵌，开放合作带来机遇发展，“脱钩断链”意味着自我封闭。保护主义不能解决世界产业结构调整的问题，反而将恶化国际贸易环境。中欧双方应该坚持伙伴关系定位，秉持开放态度推进合作，确保中欧关系沿着独立自主、合作共赢的正确轨道发展。
马克龙表示，法中保持密切高层交往，始终相互信任、相互尊重。法方重视对华关系，坚定奉行一个中国政策，愿持续深化法中全面战略伙伴关系。法方乐见中国经济蓬勃发展，坚持开放合作，为世界带来更多机遇，愿同中方促进相互投资，加强经贸、可再生能源等领域合作，促进友好文化交流。法方欢迎中国企业更多赴法投资，愿提供公平、非歧视营商环境。法方致力于推动欧中关系健康稳定发展，认为欧中应坚持对话合作，欧洲应实现战略自主。面对世界地缘形势不稳、多边秩序受到冲击，法中合作更显重要，不可或缺。法方完全赞同习近平主席有关改革完善全球治理、推动全球经济更加平衡的意见，愿同中方加强协调，共担大国责任、坚持多边主义，加强在应对气候变化、保护生物多样性、人工智能治理等领域合作，为促进世界和平与繁荣作出贡献。
两国元首就乌克兰危机交换意见。习近平指出，中方支持一切有利于和平的努力，将继续以自己的方式为危机政治解决发挥建设性作用。中方支持欧洲国家发挥应有作用，推动构建均衡、有效、可持续的欧洲安全架构。
会谈后，两国元首共同见证签署核能、农食、教育、生态环境等领域多项合作文件。
两国元首还共同会见了中外记者。
会谈前，习近平和夫人彭丽媛在人民大会堂北大厅为马克龙和夫人布丽吉特举行欢迎仪式。
马克龙抵达时，礼兵列队致敬。两国元首登上检阅台，军乐团奏中法两国国歌，天安门广场鸣放礼炮21响。马克龙在习近平陪同下检阅中国人民解放军仪仗队，并观看分列式。
当天中午，习近平和彭丽媛在人民大会堂金色大厅为马克龙夫妇举行欢迎宴会。
王毅参加上述活动。

2025年12月12日，“国际和平与信任年论坛”在土库曼斯坦阿什哈巴德市举行，国家主席习近平向论坛致贺信。
习近平指出，今年是土库曼斯坦提议、联合国大会确立的国际和平与信任年，今天又恰逢土库曼斯坦获得永久中立地位30周年。中土两国是志同道合的好朋友、合作共赢的好伙伴。中方坚定支持土方奉行永久中立政策，赞赏土方为维护国际和地区和平稳定、促进各国共同发展作出的积极努力。
习近平强调，当前全球性挑战层出不穷，冲突对抗此起彼伏，世界比以往任何时候都更呼唤和平与信任。历史昭示我们，国际形势越是变乱交织，国际社会越要同舟共济、守望相助。我们要互尊互信互谅，弥合和平赤字，坚定维护联合国权威和地位，坚持以和平方式解决争端，反对霸道霸凌、损人利己。要共商共建共享，破解信任赤字，以国际法治保障公平公义，以多边主义推进团结合作，坚持全球事务大家商量，国际秩序一道维护，治理成果共同分享。
习近平强调，不久前，我提出全球治理倡议，为改革完善全球治理体系提供了中国方案。中方期待同世界各国携手努力，维护世界和平，促进共同发展，推动构建人类命运共同体。

李强表示，近年来，受地缘政治动荡加剧、国际经贸限制措施增多等影响，全球贸易投资走势低迷，产业链供应链碎片化风险上升，很大程度拖累了世界经济增长。在这样的形势下，中国经济稳健前行，始终坚持以自身所能，为世界经济注入确定性、稳定性。“十五五”时期，中国经济将持续向好。我们将坚持扩大内需这个战略基点，促进消费和投资、供给和需求良性互动，增强国内大循环的内生动力和可靠性。我们将以智能化、绿色化、融合化为方向，推进建设现代化产业体系，并同更多国家加强产业对接合作，推动全球产业链供应链不断提质增效。我们将实施更加积极的宏观政策，从市场关切出发，更好发挥财政政策、货币政策作用，保持经济增长在合理区间。我们将继续向世界开放自身超大规模市场，同各国分享发展机遇，并通过加强对话沟通妥处经贸摩擦，更好实现互利共赢。
李强指出，中方坚定支持以联合国为核心的国际体系，支持各国际经济组织工作，愿推动各方一道落实四大全球倡议，践行真正的多边主义，推进平等有序的世界多极化、普惠包容的经济全球化。中方愿同世界银行保持良好合作关系，在知识、养老、人民币贷款等领域加强合作。中方将继续为国际货币基金组织上海中心运行提供有力支持，积极推进基金组织份额改革，在帮助低收入国家发展等方面深化合作。中方愿同联合国贸发会议加强沟通协调，聚焦绿色矿产、数字经济、人工智能、低碳转型等领域持续拓展合作。
彭安杰、格奥尔基耶娃、格林斯潘表示，中国近年来取得举世瞩目发展成就，为促进世界经济增长发挥重要作用。中国“十五五”规划将为世界经济带来宝贵的确定性和强劲动力。各方高度赞赏中国长期以来对全球南方发展提供的宝贵帮助，愿同中方进一步加强政策沟通，深化贸易投资、人工智能、绿色发展等领域合作，共同致力于促进贸易投资便利化和开放包容发展，坚持多边主义，维护联合国等多边机构权威，改革完善全球治理体系。

2025年12月30日，中共中央政治局委员、外交部长王毅在北京出席2025年国际形势与中国外交研讨会开幕式并作主旨
发言
。
王毅表示，2025年是世界反法西斯战争胜利80周年，也是联合国成立80周年。这一年，国际格局演变走向分水岭，单极霸权不得人心，多极世界扑面而来，进步还是倒退之争日趋激烈；经济全球化遭遇严重冲击，开放还是封闭之选迫在眉睫；全球局部战争和跨境冲突频发，和平还是战争之问扣动人心。
王毅说，面对历史演进新关口，我们在以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导下，高举构建人类命运共同体旗帜，以元首外交为战略引领，用最大诚意团结世界进步力量，尽最大努力汇聚和平发展能量，做世界和平乱局中的稳定锚、周边环境新局中的主心骨、国际秩序变局中的定盘星、全球发展困局中的主引擎、国际道义危局中的压舱石，为中华民族谋复兴，为动荡世界谋大同，不断开创中国特色大国外交新境界。
王毅强调，中国特色大国外交2025年的奋斗历程，让我们比以往任何时候都更加深切地感受到：中国与世界的关系正在朝着更加积极的方向发展，中国的国际影响力、创新引领力、道义感召力显著提升。今天的中国外交之所以从容自信、破浪前行，关键在于习近平主席领航掌舵，关键在于习近平外交思想科学指引，关键在于党中央集中统一领导，同时也在于广大人民群众的大力支持，在于中国的外交理念始终占据国际道义的制高点。
王毅表示，“十五五”时期是基本实现社会主义现代化夯实基础、全面发力的关键时期。中国与世界关系进入我们可以为人类发展进步作出更大贡献的新阶段。2026年作为“十五五”开局之年，中国特色大国外交要更有作为。我们将为国家发展民族振兴提供更坚实战略支撑，为走出大国关系新路开辟更有效途径，为构建周边命运共同体作出更积极努力，为全球南方共同迈向现代化汇聚更磅礴力量，为全球开放合作注入更强劲动力，为改革完善全球治理作出更突出贡献，为捍卫国家利益展现更坚定使命担当。
王毅强调，我们将更加紧密地团结在以习近平同志为核心的党中央周围，坚持习近平外交思想的科学指引，以更加积极主动的历史担当、更加富有活力的创造精神，为强国建设、民族复兴伟业和构建人类命运共同体事业作出新的贡献。
2025年国际形势与中国外交研讨会由中国国际问题研究院主办。

中柬泰外长举行三方会晤

2025年12月29日，中柬泰外长会晤在云南玉溪成功举行。中共中央政治局委员、外交部长王毅和柬埔寨副首相兼外交大臣布拉索昆、泰国外长西哈萨以及三国军队的负责人出席。
王毅表示，柬泰边境冲突爆发以来，中方秉持习近平主席提出的全球安全倡议精神，积极居间调停斡旋。中国领导人与柬泰领导人保持友好沟通，外长层面多次通话联系，中方特使四度穿梭访问，重在听取双方意见，照顾各自合理关切，找到对话谈判化解分歧的路径。在各方共同努力下，柬泰军方日前达成停火协议，中方对此感到欣慰。
王毅表示，三方会晤正当其时。我们在此举行了多场双边会谈，尤其是柬泰两国外交和军事部门也在此进行了面对面深入交流，都展现了积极开放态度，都致力于缓局降温，也都愿在停火基础上改善两国关系。三方之间的讨论是有益、建设性的，形成了重要共识：一是共同向前看、向前走。停火协议来之不易，不能停滞不前，不能半途而废，更不能重燃战火，这并非人民所愿，也不是中方所盼；二是循序渐进不停留。停火安排的落实执行需要保持沟通协商，恢复两国关系也要逐步推进，但只要双方保持信心，平等对话，就一定能达成目标；三是重建互信最重要。冲突造成信任缺失，但柬泰是永远的邻国，拥有悠久友好交往史。这次聚首抚仙湖，希望能抚平冲突带来的创伤，拂去彼此心中的隔阂，真正实现重归于好，这才符合柬泰人民利益，也是各方共同期待。中方将始终做柬泰关系发展的促进者，愿意提供一切必要协助和支持，包括停火监督、人道援助、扫雷合作等方面，期待并相信柬泰关系早日重回正轨。
柬泰两国外长感谢中方提供这次的对话平台，高度赞赏中方为化解冲突、缓和局势、推动对话发挥的建设性作用。双方均强调和平之宝贵，愿积极落实停火协议，用好各层级对话机制，共同管控并解决好争端，共同维护两国边境地区安宁。
三方会晤后发表新闻公报，从五个方面明确柬泰将进一步加强沟通，增进理解，循序渐进地巩固停火局面、恢复彼此交往、重建政治互信、实现关系转圜、维护地区和平。

在历史演进重大关头开拓中国特色大国外交新境界
——在2025年国际形势与中国外交研讨会上的主旨发言

（2025年12月30日，北京）
各位专家，各位朋友：
大家好！很高兴岁末年初再次相聚，一道探讨国际形势，盘点中国外交。
2025年是世界反法西斯战争胜利80周年，也是联合国成立80周年。在这个厚重的历史性年份，世界再次来到何去何从的重要关口。
这一年，国际格局演变走向重要分水岭，单极霸权不得人心，多极世界扑面而来，百年变局下的新旧矛盾集中暴发，进步还是倒退之争日趋激烈。
这一年，经济全球化遭遇严重冲击，关税战破坏国际贸易规则，扰乱全球经济秩序，开放还是封闭之选迫在眉睫。
这一年，全球局部战争和跨境冲突频发，创下二战结束以来新高，地缘政治动荡持续蔓延，和平还是战争之问扣动人心。
面对历史演进新关口，我们在以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导下，高举构建人类命运共同体旗帜，以元首外交为战略引领，用最大诚意团结世界进步力量，尽最大努力汇聚和平发展能量，保和平、促合作、应变局、担道义，为中华民族谋复兴，为动荡世界谋大同，不断开创中国特色大国外交新境界。
面对世界和平乱局，中国是稳定锚。
百年变局加速演进，国际关系动荡变革，大国发生冲突对抗的风险明显上升。
中国作为世界主要大国、联合国安理会常任理事国，始终以维护世界和平为己任，身体力行推动构建新型大国关系，劝和促谈致力热点问题降温，坚持以同球共济超越地缘博弈，为维护世界和平展现大国担当。
过去一年，中美关系历经起伏震荡，实现了总体动态稳定，这符合中美两国人民共同利益，符合国际社会共同期待；中俄关系更加坚如磐石，保持高水平稳健运行，两国领导人在历史性年份实现互访，凸显中俄相互信任、相互支撑的全面战略协作伙伴关系真谛；中欧总结建交50年合作经验，再次确认伙伴关系基本定位；全球南方10国正式加入“金砖伙伴圈”，20个成员的“金砖大家庭”不断兴旺，“大金砖合作”越发红火。
乌克兰危机延宕已接近4年。中方以习近平主席提出的“四个应该”为基本遵循，坚持不懈为和平创造条件，汇聚共识。作为乌克兰危机“和平之友”的倡导者之一，我们真诚欢迎一切有利于和平解决危机的努力，同其他各方一道为之积极奔走呼吁。现在，谈判的窗口已经打开，和平的曙光就在前面。尽管前进道路仍然崎岖坎坷，但中方愿继续发挥建设性作用，期待达成全面、持久、有约束力的和平协议，消除矛盾冲突的根源，实现欧洲长治久安。
面对周边环境新局，中国是主心骨。
在变乱交织的世界中，亚洲成为举世公认的全球发展繁荣高地，我国同周边国家关系处于近代以来最好的时期。同时，周边格局和世界变局深度联动，维护周边繁荣稳定需要付出不懈努力。
在周边形势演变关键时刻，党中央召开新中国成立以来首次周边工作会议，明确周边在中华民族伟大复兴进程中的重要定位，提出建设和平、安宁、繁荣、美丽、友好“五大家园”的努力方向，确立构建周边命运共同体的总体目标，发出携手周边国家共创美好未来的战略信号，为我国同周边国家关系发展注入新的强劲动力。
习近平主席今年主场外交和重要出访着眼周边。东南亚之行以点带面，巩固同东盟国家睦邻友好，推进互利合作，迎接共同挑战。俄罗斯之行传承中俄友谊、捍卫历史正义，把两大邻国互信合作提升到新水平。中亚之行首提“中国—中亚精神”，签署永久睦邻友好合作条约，筑牢西北方向长期稳定根基。东北亚之行引领亚太务实合作，推动中韩关系改善发展。今年，我们还邀请印度、朝鲜领导人来华，中印关系呈现向好发展势头，中朝传统友谊得到巩固弘扬。习近平主席主持上海合作组织天津峰会取得圆满成功，制定上合组织未来10年发展战略，落地4个地区安全中心，创设6个合作平台，签署数十份各领域合作文件。我国同周边国家的交往正迈入加快构建命运共同体的新时期。
一年来的周边关系发展和周边环境演变再次证明，与中国为邻是好事、幸事。中国不在周边搞地缘争夺，而是致力于睦邻安邻富邻；不在周边搞势力范围，而是构建命运共同体；不在周边搞一言堂，而是践行大家的事一起商量着办。中国的周边，堪称睦邻友好的示范区。
面对国际秩序变局，中国是定盘星。
联合国风雨兼程80年，国际体系变革按下快进键。面对时代发展大潮，有人极力踩刹车，有人试图开倒车，而中国的选择是面向未来，携手各方共建人类命运共同体，推动国际秩序朝着更加公正合理的方向发展。
构建人类命运共同体是习近平外交思想的核心理念，顺应时代发展进步潮流，符合中国人民和世界各国人民共同利益。今年胜利召开的中国共产党第二十届四中全会通过的“十五五”规划建议，以构建人类命运共同体为主线，部署未来五年的对外工作，展现出中国为人类谋进步、为世界谋大同的坚定信念和实际行动。
2025年，世界见证了全球治理变革的“中国时刻”。习近平主席郑重提出全球治理倡议，倡导主权平等、国际法治、多边主义、以人为本、行动导向五大理念，为推动构建更加公正合理的全球治理体系提出中国方案，为重振联合国的核心地位和主导作用注入中国动力。这一倡议的提出正当其时，切中当今世界迫切需求，得到150多个国家和国际组织迅速响应支持。中国隆重纪念中国人民抗日战争暨世界反法西斯战争胜利80周年，习近平主席发表重要讲话，弘扬伟大抗战精神，坚持正确二战史观，发出正义必胜、和平必胜、人民必胜的时代强音。习近平主席专门出席在北京举办的全球妇女峰会，强调要为加速妇女发展新进程凝聚更广泛共识、开辟更广阔道路。我国会同30多个国家共同创立国际调解院，成为首个专门以调解方式解决国际争端的政府间国际组织，呼应联合国宪章要求，为各国搭建起化解分歧的新平台。中国倡导成立世界人工智能合作组织，将致力于加强全球南方人工智能能力建设，弥合“智能鸿沟”，加快人工智能全球治理进程。
然而，就在这个世界各国人民汲取历史教训、共谋和平发展的特殊年份，当年发动侵华战争的日本，不仅不深刻反省自身犯下的种种罪行，其现职领导人竟然公开挑战中国领土主权、挑战二战历史结论、挑战战后国际秩序。对此，所有爱好和平的国家、所有不希望悲剧重演的人民都绝不答应。我们必须高度警惕日本军国主义沉渣泛起，必须坚决捍卫用鲜血换来的二战胜利成果，必须有效维护来之不易的和平稳定。
面对全球发展困局，中国是主引擎。
全球经济增速放缓，单边主义、保护主义横行，国际经贸秩序遭受严重冲击，各国发展面临重大挑战。中国经济顶压前行、向新向优，以强大韧性和充沛活力为世界提供支撑，以更高水平对外开放包括单边开放与世界分享机遇，中国对世界经济增长贡献率继续保持在30%左右，高于七国集团总和，成为全球发展爬坡脱困的主要推进器。
过去一年，我们大力推进高质量共建“一带一路”，同南亚、拉美、中亚多个国家新签合作规划和行动计划，对共建“一带一路”国家非金融类直接投资同比增长20%以上。坦赞铁路激活续写中非友谊新丰碑，中吉乌铁路建设孕育区域联通新前景，中欧班列累计开行12万列，一条又一条双向奔赴的“黄金通道”加速延伸拓展。
过去一年，我们扛起促进全球发展重任，连续举办进博会、服贸会、消博会，海南自贸港正式启动全岛封关，同东盟全面完成并签署自贸区3.0升级版议定书，同非洲持续实施“十大伙伴行动”，同拉美国家建设“五大工程”，同阿拉伯国家构建“五大合作格局”，同太平洋岛国形成七大合作平台架构，成功举行首次东盟—中国—海合会峰会，同各方结成更紧密发展合作伙伴。
过去一年，我们克服外部环境干扰和挑战，向需要支持和帮助的国际伙伴伸出援手，对所有最不发达国家和非洲国家实施“零关税”，宣布在坚持发展中国家定位的同时，不在世贸组织谈判中寻求新的特殊和差别待遇，主动让利于全球南方国家，承担起中国的国际责任。
过去一年，我们广迎四方客，持续扩容免签“朋友圈”，迄今已对48国实施单方面免签、对55国实施过境免签，今年前三季度免签入境外国人超过2000万、同比增长50%以上，开创了中外人文交流新局面。中国同世界的交流交融不断加深，世界投向中国的目光更加理性友善。
面对国际道义危局，中国是压舱石。
强权不是公理，赢者不能通吃；良知不会泯灭，公道自在人间。中国外交弘扬和平、发展、公平、正义、民主、自由的全人类共同价值，致力在国际上守正道、扬公道、行大道，坚定守护国际道义的底线。
为寻求更加持久的和平，我们践行客观公正、标本兼治的中国特色热点问题解决之道，坚持不干涉内政、不拱火浇油、不拉偏架、不谋私利，一秉诚意斡旋缅北、伊核、印巴、巴以等矛盾以及最近的柬泰冲突。我们的坚持和努力经得起历史检验。国际社会促成加沙停火的努力值得欢迎，但世界仍欠巴勒斯坦一个公道。巴勒斯坦问题不能再次被边缘化，巴勒斯坦人民争取民族合法权利的事业不能无果而终，“巴人所有、巴人治巴”的原则必须坚持，“两国方案”仍是全面、公正、持久解决巴勒斯坦问题的唯一正确选择。
为争取一个更平等的世界，我们在事关国际道义的大是大非问题上坚定站在历史正确一边，旗帜鲜明反对霸权主义和强权政治，向遭受不公的国家提供力所能及的道义和行动支持。关税战、贸易战损害各国正当权益，损害多边贸易体制。我们挺身而出，既是为了维护自身正当权益，更是为了捍卫国际公平正义。
各位专家，各位朋友：
中美关系是当今世界最重要的双边关系之一。中美两国的战略选择，影响世界历史的演进方向。一年来，我们坚持从自身与世界的整体和长远利益出发看待和处理对美关系，在重大原则问题上立场坚定、态度鲜明，在涉及中国核心利益的问题上针锋相对、寸步不让，同时同美方接触对话、寻求合作，推动美方理性客观看待中国，通过协商对话解决双方分歧。习近平主席同特朗普总统4次通话、多次通信，在韩国釜山会晤期间就事关中美关系以及世界和平与发展的重大问题深入沟通，引领中美关系巨轮穿越急流险滩、保持正确航向。
一年来中美关系发展的实践表明，能不能做到相互尊重、和平共处、合作共赢，是中美关系能否稳定发展、造福世界的关键所在。中美合则两利、斗则俱伤，居高临下行不通，言行不一不可取。中美必须在平等、尊重、互惠基础上寻找解决各自关切的办法，探索出两个大国的正确相处之道。
台湾问题是中国的内政，是中国核心利益中的核心。针对“台独”势力的不断挑衅以及美国大规模对台售武，我们当然要坚决反对、有力反制。今年是台湾回归祖国80周年，实现祖国完全统一，是在依法维护国家的主权和领土完整，是我们必须完成的历史使命。我们看到，越来越多的国家和中国站在一起，不仅重申坚持一个中国原则、承认台湾是中国的领土，还明确反对一切“台独”分裂行径，支持中国统一大业。任何企图阻挡这一历史大势的倒行逆施都必将以失败而告终。
中国特色大国外交2025年的奋斗历程，让我们比以往任何时候都更加深切地感受到：中国与世界的关系正在朝着更加积极的方向发展，中国的国际影响力、创新引领力、道义感召力显著提升。今天的中国外交之所以从容自信、破浪前行，关键在于习近平主席领航掌舵，关键在于习近平外交思想科学指引，关键在于党中央集中统一领导，同时也在于广大人民群众的大力支持，在于中国的外交理念始终占据国际道义的制高点。
各位专家，各位朋友：
“十五五”时期是基本实现社会主义现代化夯实基础、全面发力的关键时期，中国与世界关系进入我们可以为人类发展进步作出更大贡献的新阶段。2026年作为“十五五”开局之年，中国特色大国外交要更有作为。
第一，我们将为国家发展民族振兴提供更坚实战略支撑。
“十五五”时期，我国发展将与世界百年变局进一步交织联动，国际形势深刻影响国内发展，中国发展深度牵动国际格局。
服务好“十五五”起步开局是明年外交工作重要使命。我们将增强历史主动，提高政治站位，紧密对标党和国家发展新目标，坚决完成元首外交新任务，以系统观念把握百年变局新动向，有力服务高质量发展，积极推进高水平对外开放，有效化解外部风险挑战，助力我国在激烈国际竞争中继续赢得战略主动。我们将把中国人民的利益与世界各国人民的利益更紧密地结合起来，把中国式现代化与世界各国的现代化建设更有机地对接起来，为续写经济快速发展和社会长期稳定两大奇迹新篇章作出外交领域的新贡献，为以中国式现代化全面推进强国建设、民族复兴伟业营造更有利外部环境。
第二，我们将为走出大国关系新路开辟更有效途径。
大国是影响战争与和平的主要因素。世界必须找到一条新时期大国和平共进的新路。
中国锚定的是和平发展，在提升自身和平发展战略能力的过程中，致力于推动其他大国也走和平发展道路，携手构建和平共处、总体稳定、均衡发展的大国关系格局。我们将坚持按照相互尊重、和平共处、合作共赢三原则，打造中美两国积极互动新范式，在坚定维护国家主权、安全、发展利益基础上，推动中美关系实现健康、稳定、可持续发展。我们将巩固永久睦邻友好、全面战略协作、互利合作共赢的中俄关系，为中俄新时代全面战略协作伙伴关系不断增添新内涵，共同维护好大国关系和国际战略稳定。我们将弘扬中欧相互尊重、求同存异、开放合作、互利共赢的交往传统，打开中欧关系新空间，做坚守多边主义的真伙伴。
第三，我们将为构建周边命运共同体作出更积极努力。
构建人类命运共同体是中国外交的崇高目标，是需要不懈努力、持续推进的历史进程。周边是推动构建人类命运共同体的关键。
我们将深入贯彻中央周边工作会议精神，秉持亲诚惠容、命运与共理念，携手各国共建和平家园，倡导共同安全意识，妥善管控矛盾分歧，让人民远离冲突和战争。共建安宁家园，积极斡旋热点问题降温回稳，培育彼此战略互信，消除矛盾滋生的土壤条件。共建繁荣家园，挖掘RCEP合作潜力，确保中国东盟自贸区3.0尽早实施，深化周边发展融合格局。共建美丽家园，加强生态文明交流，践行“绿水青山就是金山银山”理念，推动区域可持续发展。共建友好家园，扩大人文交流，推进民心相通，筑牢周边命运共同体的民意民心根基。
第四，我们将为全球南方共同迈向现代化汇聚更磅礴力量。
现代化不等于西方化，中国与全球南方国家在现代化道路上相互支持、并肩前行，将共同绘就人类文明进步新的壮丽图景。
作为最大发展中国家，中国将坚定维护发展中国家整体利益，致力于全球南方联合自强。金砖国家是全球南方合作的重要平台。我们将支持金砖机制做大做强，推动金砖国家在多极化进程中提升代表性和话语权。2026年是中非建交70周年。我们将推进《支持非洲现代化合作倡议》，加快同非洲国家商签共同发展经济伙伴关系协定，推动对非洲“零关税”政策加快落地，书写中非命运与共的历史新篇。中东局势动荡牵动世界。我们将主办第二届中国—阿拉伯国家峰会，增强中阿团结互信，加快完成中国—海合会自由贸易协定谈判，朝着建设中阿命运共同体方向不断迈进。我们密切关注拉美地区形势变化，将坚定支持拉美国家捍卫自身主权和民族尊严，在自主选择的道路上加快发展振兴。
第五，我们将为全球开放合作注入更强劲动力。
“十五五”规划是中国发展的新蓝图，也是中国与世界合作共赢的新愿景。中国将坚持高水平对外开放，持续向世界释放超大规模市场红利，引领全球开放合作潮流、对冲脱钩封闭逆流，同各国共克时艰、共享机遇。
我们将在高质量共建“一带一路”进程中，更好统筹重大标志性工程和“小而美”民生项目，妥善应对发展道路上出现的干扰和困难，建设好这一全球规模最大、范围最广的国际合作平台，走好这条中国与世界共赢之路。我们将坚定维护以世贸组织为核心的多边贸易体制，共同抵制保护主义和关税霸道霸凌，拓展同世界各国各地区的贸易和投资自由化便利化。作为2026年亚太经合组织东道主，我们将与各经济体加强沟通、密切协调，合力推进亚太共同体建设，激活并探索实现亚太自贸区的路径，让亚太地区继续走在世界开放合作的前列。
第六，我们将为改革完善全球治理作出更突出贡献。
面对接踵而来的全球性挑战，国际体系和机制急需与时俱进、改革完善。习近平主席相继提出全球发展、全球安全、全球文明、全球治理四大倡议，倡导推进平等有序的世界多极化、普惠包容的经济全球化，为构建更加公正合理的全球治理体系提供了战略引领。
我们将同志同道合国家一道，践行真正的多边主义，继续做现行国际体系的维护者和建设者。我们将携手各方，增强联合国权威和地位，坚守联合国宪章宗旨和原则，支持联合国在关乎世界和平与发展的重大问题上发挥核心作用。我们将大力推动发展议题重回全球治理议程的中心，支持优先增加全球南方国家在各种治理机制中的权重。我们将积极弥补“治理赤字”、填补“治理盲区”、拓展“治理疆域”，本着开放包容精神同各方共商共建新的治理机制和平台。
第七，我们将为捍卫国家利益展现更坚定使命担当。
身处百年变局，中国外交将勇于直面风高浪急甚至惊涛骇浪的考验。我们将坚持原则、坚守底线，坚定维护国家主权、安全、发展利益，坚决挫败一切分裂国家的行径。我们将以不畏强权的坚定意志，不断提升和完善反制裁、反干预、反“长臂管辖”能力，为有效维护国家和人民利益提供更有力机制保障。我们将毫不动摇践行外交为民宗旨，加快构建更加严密的海外安全保障体系，强化风险预警机制建设，加强同各国执法安全合作，让中国公民、法人在海外工作生活更安全、更踏实、更放心。
各位专家，各位朋友：
时代潮流浩浩荡荡，中华民族伟大复兴势不可挡。我们将更加紧密地团结在以习近平同志为核心的党中央周围，坚持习近平外交思想的科学指引，以更加积极主动的历史担当、更加富有活力的创造精神，为强国建设、民族复兴伟业和构建人类命运共同体事业作出新的贡献。
谢谢大家！

我们将为国家发展民族振兴提供更坚实战略支撑。
服务好“十五五”起步开局是明年外交工作重要使命。我们将增强历史主动，提高政治站位，坚决完成元首外交新任务，有力服务高质量发展，有效化解外部风险挑战，助力我国在激烈国际竞争中继续赢得战略主动。把中国人民的利益与世界各国人民的利益更紧密地结合起来，把中国式现代化与世界各国的现代化建设更有机地对接起来，为强国建设和民族复兴营造更有利外部环境。

2025年12月30日，中共中央政治局委员、外交部长王毅在2025年国际形势与中国外交研讨会上表示，台湾问题是中国的内政，是中国核心利益中的核心。针对“台独”势力不断挑衅以及美国大规模对台售武，我们当然要坚决反对、有力反制。今年是台湾光复80周年，实现祖国完全统一，是在依法维护国家的主权和领土完整，是我们必须完成的历史使命。我们看到，越来越多的国家和中国站在一起，不仅重申坚持一个中国原则、承认台湾是中国的领土，还明确反对一切“台独”分裂行径，支持中国统一大业。任何企图阻挡这一历史大势的倒行逆施都必将以失败而告终。

2025年12月30日，中共中央政治局委员、外交部长王毅在2025年国际形势与中国外交研讨会上表示，中美关系是当今世界最重要的双边关系之一。中美两国的战略选择，影响世界历史的演进方向。一年来，我们坚持从自身与世界的整体和长远利益出发看待和处理对美关系，在重大原则问题上立场坚定、态度鲜明，在涉及中国核心利益的问题上针锋相对、寸步不让，同时同美方接触对话、寻求合作，推动美方理性客观看待中国，通过协商对话解决双方分歧。习近平主席同特朗普总统4次通话、多次通信，在韩国釜山会晤期间就事关中美关系以及世界和平与发展的重大问题深入沟通，引领中美关系巨轮穿越急流险滩、保持正确航向。
王毅说，一年来中美关系发展的实践表明，能不能做到相互尊重、和平共处、合作共赢，是中美关系能否稳定发展、造福世界的关键所在。中美合则两利、斗则俱伤，居高临下行不通，言行不一不可取。中美必须在平等、尊重、互惠基础上寻找解决各自关切的办法，探索出两个大国的正确相处之道。

2025年12月30日，中共中央政治局委员、外交部长王毅在2025年国际形势与中国外交研讨会上表示，面对国际道义危局，中国是压舱石。强权不是公理，赢者不能通吃；良知不会泯灭，公道自在人间。中国外交弘扬和平、发展、公平、正义、民主、自由的全人类共同价值，致力在国际上守正道、扬公道、行大道，坚定守护国际道义的底线。
王毅说，为寻求更加持久的和平，我们践行客观公正、标本兼治的中国特色热点问题解决之道，坚持不干涉内政、不拱火浇油、不拉偏架、不谋私利，一秉诚意斡旋缅北、伊核、印巴、巴以等矛盾以及最近的柬泰冲突。我们的坚持和努力经得起历史检验。国际社会促成加沙停火的努力值得欢迎，但世界仍欠巴勒斯坦一个公道。巴勒斯坦问题不能再次被边缘化，巴勒斯坦人民争取民族合法权利的事业不能无果而终，“巴人所有、巴人治巴”的原则必须坚持，“两国方案”仍是全面、公正、持久解决巴勒斯坦问题的唯一正确选择。
王毅表示，为争取一个更平等的世界，我们在事关国际道义的大是大非问题上坚定站在历史正确一边，旗帜鲜明反对霸权主义和强权政治，向遭受不公的国家提供力所能及的道义和行动支持。关税战、贸易战损害各国正当权益，损害多边贸易体制。我们挺身而出，既是为了维护自身正当权益，更是为了捍卫国际公平正义。

2025年12月30日，中共中央政治局委员、外交部长王毅在2025年国际形势与中国外交研讨会上表示，面对全球发展困局，中国是主引擎。全球经济增速放缓，单边主义、保护主义横行，国际经贸秩序遭受严重冲击，各国发展面临重大挑战。中国经济顶压前行、向新向优，以强大韧性和充沛活力为世界提供支撑，以更高水平对外开放包括单边开放与世界分享机遇，中国对世界经济增长贡献率继续保持在30%左右，高于七国集团总和，成为全球发展爬坡脱困的主要推进器。
过去一年，我们大力推进高质量共建“一带一路”，同南亚、拉美、中亚多个国家新签合作规划和行动计划，对共建“一带一路”国家非金融类直接投资同比增长20%以上。坦赞铁路激活续写中非友谊新丰碑，中吉乌铁路建设孕育区域联通新前景，中欧班列累计开行12万列，一条又一条双向奔赴的“黄金通道”加速延伸拓展。
过去一年，我们扛起促进全球发展重任，连续举办进博会、服贸会、消博会，海南自贸港正式启动全岛封关，同东盟全面完成并签署自贸区3.0升级版议定书，同非洲持续实施“十大伙伴行动”，同拉美国家建设“五大工程”，同阿拉伯国家构建“五大合作格局”，同太平洋岛国形成七大合作平台架构，成功举行首次东盟—中国—海合会峰会，同各方结成更紧密发展合作伙伴。
过去一年，我们克服外部环境干扰和挑战，向需要支持和帮助的国际伙伴伸出援手，对所有最不发达国家和非洲国家实施“零关税”，宣布在坚持发展中国家定位的同时，不在世贸组织谈判中寻求新的特殊和差别待遇，主动让利于全球南方国家，承担起中国的国际责任。
过去一年，我们广迎四方客，持续扩容免签“朋友圈”，迄今已对48国实施单方面免签、对55国实施过境免签，今年前三季度免签入境外国人超过2000万、同比增长50%以上，开创了中外人文交流新局面。中国同世界的交流交融不断加深，世界投向中国的目光更加理性友善。

2025年12月16日至17日，中国政府中东问题特使翟隽访问欧盟，会见欧盟中东和平进程特别代表比戈。
翟隽表示，中方高度关注巴勒斯坦问题，一直为推动解决巴勒斯坦问题作出不懈努力。不久前，习近平主席宣布中方将向巴勒斯坦提供1亿美元援助，用于缓解加沙人道主义危机，支持加沙恢复与重建。
中欧在维护地区和世界和平稳定方面肩负共同责任。在巴勒斯坦问题上，中欧都支持加沙停火、缓解人道危机、落实“两国方案”等，这也是国际社会的广泛共识。中方愿同欧盟保持沟通协调，推动巴勒斯坦问题在“两国方案”基础上早日实现全面、公正、持久解决，实现中东地区长治久安。
比戈表示，欧中双方在推动解决巴勒斯坦问题、支持“两国方案”上立场相近。当前，加沙局势出现新的变化，既面临机遇，也存在风险和挑战。欧方将加大努力，推动加沙战后重建，积极参与战后治理。欧方愿同中方一道，为推动巴勒斯坦问题的公正持久解决发挥建设性作用。

两国高层交往夯实战略互信。
8月，习近平主席同埃尔多安总统在上海合作组织天津峰会期间举行会晤，达成一系列重要共识，为中土关系发展指明方向、注入动力。全国人大常委会副委员长肖捷访土，双方交通、卫生、农林、文旅部门负责人交流密切，为全面落实两国元首共识深入沟通对表。
双方战略对接助力互利合作。
“一带一路”倡议与“中间走廊”计划加快对接，对接工作组首次会议成功召开。今年前10个月，中土贸易额同比增长7.7%、突破433亿美元，全年有望再创新高。截至目前，中国对土直接投资存量达32亿美元，中国企业对土投资热情持续高涨。两国央行续签双边本币互换协议，人民币清算行正式落户土耳其。两国大幅提升往来客运航班频次，中欧班列（成渝）南通道特快班列实现常态化运营，大湾区首次开行赴土中欧班列。
中土人文交流促进民心相通。
去年，中国是土增长最快的国际游客来源地。今年前11个月来土中国游客保持增长势头，超过39万人次打卡“浪漫土耳其”。中国古典名著《红楼梦》《易经》土耳其语版相继面世，“三星堆”古蜀文化和安纳托利亚文明实现穿越时空的对话，首届中土美食文化节献上舌尖上的文化盛宴，为土耳其朋友走近中国架起新的平台。
抵土履新一年来，我走访了十多个省份，同土政商学媒各界朋友广泛交流，璀璨悠久的历史文明、日新月异的城市建设和热情好客的人民给我留下了深刻印象。更令我振奋的是，从中央到地方，甚至最遥远的边境省份，各界朋友都关心、支持中国和土中关系发展，近期土知名民调公司BETIMAR民调结果显示，超六成土民众支持深化土中互利合作。
2026年是“十五五”开局之年，中土关系也将迈入第55个年头。中土同为新兴大国、全球南方重要成员，都是有着独立自主精神的国家。在百年变局加速演进的背景下，中土关系保持高水平发展，符合两国根本利益，也符合全球南方共同利益。“十五五”时期，中国将加快构建新发展格局，着力推动高质量发展，扩大高水平对外开放，推进高质量共建“一带一路”，继续为世界经济注入更多稳定性和确定性。当前，土耳其人民也正朝着“土耳其世纪”愿景踔厉奋进。双方应把握机遇、乘势而上，以两国元首重要共识为指引，不断夯实政治互信，加强发展战略对接，提升经贸、文化、旅游等传统领域合作水平，打造新能源、5G、生物医药等合作新亮点，在实现现代化的道路上相互成就，共同谱写中土战略合作关系新篇章。

2025年12月31日，驻密克罗尼西亚联邦大使吴伟在密英文报纸《你好通讯》发表署名文章《坚定恪守一个中国原则》，宣介台湾问题的历史和法理经纬，揭批近期美国宣布向中国台湾地区大规模售武恶劣行径。
文章指出，台湾问题是中国核心利益中的核心，是中美关系第一条不可逾越的红线。任何在台湾问题上越线挑衅的行径都将遭到中方的有力回击，任何参与对台售武的企业和个人都要为其错误付出代价。中国人民与密联邦人民一样，非常重视家。对于中国这个“大家”来说，台湾是终将回家的游子，而不应是被人利用的棋子。中方已再次敦促美方恪守一个中国原则和中美三个联合公报，落实美国领导人所作承诺，停止破坏台海和平稳定，停止向“台独”分裂势力发出错误信号。

2025年12月29日，驻哈萨克斯坦大使韩春霖在哈《实业报》、“头条新闻网”、“新闻室网”、“达拉新闻网”、“自然信息网”、“凤凰24网”、“信息时代网”、“商业网”、“物镜网”、“纳扎尔传媒网”、“ULT传媒网”、“草原新闻网”、“百媒网”等主流媒体发表题为《构建周边命运共同体，风景这边独好》的署名文章。全文如下：
近期，中国共产党第二十届中央委员会第四次全体会议审议通过了《中共中央关于制定国民经济和社会发展第十五个五年规划的建议》（以下简称《建议》），强调“深化周边发展融合，强化共同安全，巩固战略互信，构建周边命运共同体”。中国有句谚语叫“远亲不如近邻”，只有家门口太平了，才能踏踏实实谋发展。正如习近平主席所说：“周边是中国安身立命之所，发展繁荣之基。”当前，在周边格局和世界变局深度联动的新形势下，中国积极构建周边命运共同体为全球发展注入新动能，展现大国责任担当。
以“兼爱”促“睦邻”，命运与共携手前行
开放、包容、普惠、平衡、共赢的态度是构建周边命运共同体的必备条件，只有摒弃冷战思维和零和博弈，才能以周边促全局，推动构建更加公正合理的全球治理体系。中国已同周边17国达成构建命运共同体共识，同周边25国签署共建“一带一路”合作协议，成为周边18国的最大贸易伙伴，同中亚五国实现全面战略伙伴关系、共建“一带一路”合作伙伴、双边和区域命运共同体“三个全覆盖”。与此同时，百年未有之大变局加速演进，全球南方群体性崛起是大变局的鲜明标志，也是新时代赋予全球南方的历史新使命。《建议》明确指出：“支持全球南方联合自强，加大援外力度，提供更多国际公共产品。”中国出身南方、心系南方、扎根南方，向160多个国家提供发展援助，开展了1100多个项目，以实际行动为全球南方发展振兴注入动力。中国与中亚五国都是全球南方的天然成员，更是实现现代化道路上的同路人，必将进一步加强国家发展战略对接，以同声相求、同气相应的姿态面对新时代新局面带来的新挑战。
以“同舟”谋“安邻”，休戚与共与子同袍
当前国际安全局势日益复杂，大国博弈螺旋升级，地缘冲突易发多发，民粹主义和极端主义沉渣泛起，全球可预见和难预料的风险显著增加，妥处各类风险挑战、实现周边地区整体稳定成为构建周边命运共同体的重要任务和必由之路。中国以周边为依托，矢志消除当今世界的和平赤字、发展赤字、安全赤字、治理赤字。习近平主席指出：“亚洲人民向来具有崇尚和平的思想传统，才能成为和平共处五项原则的诞生地。”中国同中亚五国在维护地区安全稳定方面有着重要政治共识，在今年举行的第二届中国—中亚峰会上，六国共同签署《阿斯塔纳宣言》，点亮“中国—中亚精神”，明确表示在涉及彼此核心利益问题上互予理解、尊重和支持，六国决心共同打击“三股势力”以及跨国有组织犯罪，共同应对安全威胁，帮助阿富汗早日实现和平稳定和重建发展，打造和平安宁、休戚与共的地区安全格局。中国始终以同舟同济的态度，与周边国家一道化危机、闯难关、应变局、开新局。
以“普惠”助“富邻”，美美与共天下大同
习近平主席明确表示：“过去我们的开放是‘跟跑’，现在我们的开放是要‘领跑’，这是更高水平的开放。”从“跟跑”到“领跑”，揭示中国新时代高水平对外开放的新使命新前景，更体现负责任的大国担当。《建议》提出：“稳步扩大制度型开放，维护多边贸易体制，拓展国际循环”，具体描绘了推进高水平对外开放的行动路线图，深刻表达了持续向周边释放海量经济正外部性的行动自觉和政策决心。经济全球化浪潮势不可挡，贸易保护主义的偶然抬头只不过是大潮下的小小浪花，任何国家都无法在科技创新、数字经济、绿色转型等前沿发展领域树起坚壁高墙。“一花独放不是春，百花齐放春满园”，不管国际形势如何风云变幻，中国始终坚持共享发展机遇。中吉乌铁路、中哈公路、中哈连云港物流合作基地等高质量共建“一带一路”重大工程在中亚开花结果，“小而美”民生项目合作别开生面，惠及更多周边国家民众，中国通过与周边国家利益融通、发展联动、合作共赢，为维护多边贸易体系和全球产供链稳定提供全新方案‌，探索出一条邻国之间切实有效的区域合作道路。
东方欲晓，风景这边独好。哈萨克斯坦是中国山水相连、唇齿相依的好邻居、好伙伴、好朋友，更是构建周边命运共同体的重要一环。近年来在习近平主席和托卡耶夫总统的亲自擘画引领下，中哈关系不断跃上新台阶。在承前启后、继往开来的历史背景下，中方愿同哈方一道，以元首外交为引领，不断巩固政治互信，加速推进发展战略对接，为两国关系和周边命运共同体开辟新境界！

2025年12月29日，驻马尔代夫大使孔宪华在马尔代夫媒体中心、《马尔代夫日报》等主流媒体发表题为《少年强则国强——今日的年轻人，未来的领导者》的署名文章，全文如下：
不久前，中国驻马尔代夫使馆组织马优秀高中生代表团赴四川交流访问。马方师生在四川知名高校、科研机构和创新企业实地考察交流，深刻感受中国高等教育的规模与活力、青年科技创新的蓬勃态势。访问团成员纷纷表示，中国青年身上展现出的求真务实、勇于创新精神令人振奋，这不仅是中国发展的鲜明标签，更是两国青年合作的宝贵基础。
前几天，在马尔代夫国家青年大会上，我被问到一个很有价值的问题：当今青年面临的最大挑战是什么？我的回答是，青年最重要的课题，不在于眼前一时一事，而在于思考未来十年世界将走向何方。十年后，今天的青年将成为家庭和社会的中坚力量，承担起更重要的责任，因此，准备必须从现在开始。
我们正身处一个深刻变革的时代。以就业为例，十年后哪些行业最具潜力并不明朗，新产业不断涌现，知识更新速度显著加快，传统教育与产业变革之间的“时间差”日益凸显。这既是全球青年普遍面临的现实挑战，也是一次历史性机遇——新一轮科技革命和产业变革正在重塑经济形态与社会结构，青年完全可以选择成为新兴产业的开拓者，而非旧模式的追随者。
中国拥有世界上规模最大、结构最完备的高等教育体系。官方数据显示，2025年全国高校毕业生规模预计达1222万人，再创历史新高。在如此体量之下，中国仍保持较强的就业吸纳能力和持续的创新动力，其背后，是清晰、稳定、面向未来的国家战略引领。
中国共产党第二十届中央委员会第四次全体会议通过的《中共中央关于制定国民经济和社会发展第十五个五年规划的建议》，将青年发展系统纳入中国式现代化整体布局，围绕教育、就业、科技创新和社会参与一体推进，为青年成长成才提供长期、可预期的制度环境。规划更加注重教育与国家重大战略、产业方向的衔接，引导青年尽早融入国家创新体系，在关键核心技术攻关中承担重要角色；通过发展新质生产力、完善公共服务体系，为青年提供更加多元、更高质量的发展空间。
在这一制度环境下，中国青年已从“后备力量”成长为科技创新的重要主体。在人工智能、新能源、高端制造、生物医药等领域，大量青年科研人员和工程师活跃在一线。人工智能领域的梁文锋及其团队研发的DeepSeek系统，在信息检索和智能决策方面实现创新应用；机器人领域，90后王兴兴创始的宇树科技研发的人形机器人已能完成绝大部分工作动作，无论是离线预学习，还是实时模仿复刻。这些实践表明，中国青年不仅具备技术能力，更善于用创新回应现实需求、服务社会发展。
在社会参与层面，中国青年的身影同样活跃而多元。在数字经济领域，青年推动数字技术融入公共服务和社会治理；在绿色发展一线，青年工程师投身新能源、储能和海洋能源等前沿领域；在基层服务和乡村振兴中，越来越多青年选择扎根社区和欠发达地区，以专业能力改善民生、助力发展。中国青年也高度关注全球性议题，在科技合作、气候行动和公共卫生等国际平台上积极参与、主动发声。值得一提的是，中国驻马尔代夫使馆的工作团队同样年轻，不少二三十岁的青年外交官活跃在一线，与中马青年并肩工作，成为两国友好合作的重要桥梁。
归根结底，摆在青年面前的最大挑战，往往不是条件本身，而是一种选择：是被动等待，还是主动作为；是抱怨变化，还是寻找、把握乃至创造机遇。中国青年在实践中给出了自己的答案。
中马两国都高度重视青年和教育发展。马政府在青年培养、职业技能培训和高等教育国际化方面持续投入，与中国在奖学金项目、高职教育合作和高校互访等领域成果丰硕。未来，使馆将继续积极搭建青年交流平台，拓展交流层次与领域，深化两国青年在科技创新、绿色经济、数字技能和社会服务等方面合作。
青年是时代的脉搏，是国家和民族的希望。相信在彼此理解、相互支持、携手努力下，中马青年必将为两国人民创造更加美好的未来，为构建更紧密的中马命运共同体注入源源不断的青春动力。

2025年12月31日，驻马来西亚大使欧阳玉靖在马来西亚中文、英文、马来文主流媒体《星洲日报》《星报》《阳光日报》发表题为《友谊长青讴歌伟大时代 命运与共再续恢弘华章》的署名文章，并祝马来西亚读者新年快乐。文章全文如下：
岁聿其暮，硕果盈枝。2025年注定是载入中马关系发展史册的一年。这一年，我们有幸见证中马领导人在双多边舞台频密互动，共同经历两国关系向高水平战略性中马命运共同体的升级跃迁。中马友谊巨轮已鸣笛起航，驶向下一个精彩辉煌的“黄金五十年”。
高层交往夯实政治互信基础。今年，习近平主席时隔十二载再度对马来西亚进行国事访问，同马国家元首、政府首脑共话友好合作、共商发展大计，将中马关系提升至历史新高度。两国高层积极支持彼此重大主场外交活动。安瓦尔总理赴华出席中国人民抗日战争暨世界反法西斯战争胜利80周年纪念大会与“上合组织+”会议，以四度访华的行动魄力印证中马关系的高水平与战略性。李强总理年内两度访马，先后出席东盟—中国—海合会三方峰会与东亚合作领导人系列会议，明确释放中方高度重视对马合作、坚定支持马方作为轮值主席国加强东盟中心地位的积极信号。扎希德、法迪拉两位副总理分别赴华出席中国国际进口博览会、中国—东盟博览会，为强化对华合作注入更多动力。双方各层级各领域互访络绎不绝，有力推动高水平战略性中马命运共同体建设不断走深走实。
务实合作续写互利共赢新篇。中马秉持平等互惠原则推进全方位合作，为两国关系长期向好发挥压舱石作用。双方密切协调，共同推动中国—东盟自贸区3.0版升级议定书成功签署。从双边经贸往来看，马来西亚是中国在东盟第二大贸易伙伴和第一大进口来源国。今年1-10月,中马贸易额达1599亿美元，中国有望连续17年成为马最大贸易伙伴。从产业合作看，中国连续多年是马高端制造业重要投资来源国，对马累计投资超208亿美元。双方加速打造新质生产力合作新高地，在数字经济、绿色发展、电动车、数据中心、人工智能等领域合作取得丰硕成果，助力彼此产业转型升级。从发展战略对接看，两国加快共建“一带一路”合作，东海岸铁路建设完成90%、进入最后冲刺阶段,“两国双园”蓬勃发展、提质升级，华为、中兴共同承建的第二张5G网络已完成60%,中国电商平台成为马中小企业拓展海外市场的重要渠道。金马士—新山双轨电气化铁路升级改造项目顺利完工，助推马铁路现代化进程。双方加快实现融合发展、协同发展、互补发展，合作红利不断涌现，持续惠及两国人民。
人文交流筑牢民心相通桥梁。今年，中马互免签证协定正式实施，两国人员往来规模创历史新高。1-10月来马中国公民总数超400万人次,每周两国间往返航班超600个。新一轮“儒伊文明对话”在马成功举办，“欢乐春节”全球启动仪式、动画电影《哪吒2》等接连在马掀起中华文化热潮。新一对旅马大熊猫顺利安家，接棒成为新的中马友好使者。“中国大使奖学金”走进更多高校，中医孔子学院在马揭牌成立，推动两国文化和教育合作进入新阶段。
一元复始，云程发轫。站在新的历史起点，中马作为高度互信、繁荣与共、世代友好的命运共同体，必将继续并肩前行、密切协作，共同拥抱机遇、应对挑战，坚定捍卫国际公平正义，为两国和本地区人民创造更多福祉，为世界和平稳定与发展繁荣继续贡献力量。

岁末的利雅得已有初冬寒意，但米斯克城马尔法厅内人气高涨，暖意融融。由中国文旅部和沙特文化部共同举办的中沙文化年压轴活动——“中沙文化市集”热闹开启。
2025年12月25日，驻沙特大使常华同沙特文化部次大臣拉希德来到“市集”，参观各展区特色展演，与中沙两国艺术家亲切交流，与现场民众一同感受两国文化交融的蓬勃活力。
“市集”具有浓浓的中国传统风格，观众们一踏入便感受到了“烟火气”和“穿越感”。中沙文化、艺术与美食同场呈现，展台之间交流如织，吸引大家驻足拍照、体验互动。
在“世遗泉州·多彩非遗”展区，泉州南音清雅悠远，扬琴与二胡旋律此起彼伏，观众们饶有兴致地观看安溪竹藤编、蟳浦女习俗（簪花围）、泉州锡雕等非遗技艺展示。非遗传承人向大家介绍制作工艺和文化内涵，并请沙特朋友亲手编织藤编小篮子、自制香牌、刻制吉祥纹样等。
常大使表示，非遗不仅是手工艺，更承载着中华文化的历史记忆与民间智慧。拉希德则说，中国手工艺种类多样、技艺精湛，沙特也有传统手工艺，这之中体现了理念共通、互学互鉴。
在墨香四溢的中阿书法展区，中沙两国书法家现场挥毫泼墨，一笔一划写出了汉语与阿拉伯语书法的历史自豪与交相辉映。常大使向拉希德介绍中华书法文化，并同沙特艺术家同写阿语书法。
在北京中轴线VR体验区，许多当地民众戴上VR设备“云游”北京中轴线，沉浸式感受这一世界文化遗产的历史底蕴与空间格局。通过虚拟与现实技术跨越时空，与中国传统文化零距离接触，感受科技创新与传统文化默契融合。
在围得水泄不通的舞台前，观众们欣赏湖南省歌舞剧院带来舞蹈、木偶等文艺表演。《变脸》《星火英歌》等精彩演出各有特色。沙特艺术家也献上民族舞蹈，将气氛不断推向高潮。
“民以食为天”，中沙美食展区成为市集中又一亮点。牛肉面、包子、米线等传统美食热气腾腾、香气四溢。常大使与拉希德也加入品鉴队伍，交流对各自饮食文化的理解。拉希德表示，沙特民众很喜欢中餐，很高兴看到越来越多中餐厅出现在利雅得及其他城市街头。
常大使还现场接受了多家媒体采访。常大使表示，今年是中沙建交35周年，也是首个“中沙文化年”。年初以“新春大集”拉开序幕，而文化市集则是重磅收官之作，为文化年画上圆满句号。全年双方已举办了60多场丰富多彩的文化活动，覆盖两国上百万人次参与。这些活动不仅促进了双方的文化交融，也不断增进两国民心相通。相信文化年的落幕更是一个逗号，双方文化交融与文明互鉴将在此基础上走深走近，为中沙全面战略伙伴关系与传统友好注入新内涵。

2025年12月13日，塞内加尔戈雷岛。大西洋的海风穿过一片独特的赛场——这里没有标准的绿茵地，沙滩托起整个舞台，贝壳点缀着球场。
在历史建筑环抱的场地中央，一棵巍峨的猴面包树伸展着苍劲的枝干，如同历史的守望者，俯瞰着一场充满活力的角逐：戈雷岛“市长杯”足球决赛激战正酣。
现场观众以热烈的沃洛夫民族歌舞为Wu Tang队与Khale Maga Tekki队的精彩对决喝彩。这不仅仅是一场体育赛事，更是一曲关于青春与未来的足球交响曲。
第一乐章：历史的静默与生命的欢腾
位于西非之角的戈雷岛，面积仅为0.28平方公里，曾是西非最大的奴隶转运站，于1978 年被联合国教科文组织列入世界遗产名录，被称作“人类剥削的象征与和解的避难所”。面向大西洋的“不归门”、“奴隶之家”博物馆，都在无声地诉说着非洲和人类文明的伤痛记忆，成为反思殖民历史、珍视和平的重要地标。
在这片承载着沉重过往的土地上，澎湃着自强不息的生命力。足球赛当天，震天鼓点、激昂音乐与冬日暖阳、飞溅的沙石交织。当Khale Maga Tekki队在第6分钟率先破门，现场爆发出雷鸣般的欢呼；然而仅4分钟后，Wu Tang队便扳平比分，展现出永不放弃的体育精神。最终，Wu Tang队以3:1反超，赢得胜利。
受戈雷岛区政府邀请，驻塞内加尔使馆在岛上观看比赛。李志刚大使与塞青年和体育部长盖伊、达喀尔市长阿巴斯、戈雷岛区长桑格尔共同为赛事颁奖，使馆青年同岛上居民们一起呐喊助威，畅叙中塞友好合作。
第二乐章：体育的桥梁与未来的邀约
2026年青奥会在达喀尔举行，这将是奥运盛会首次踏上非洲大陆，承载着非洲青年的梦想与世界期待的目光。“猴面包树球场”上的矫健身影、灿烂笑容和团队精神，映衬着达喀尔2026年青奥会“非洲欢迎，达喀尔欢庆”的主题口号。体育，正以其纯粹的激情，自信、尊重、自律的人文精神，为塞内加尔、为非洲描绘着一幅充满希望的未来愿景。
第三乐章：人文的交织与心灵的共鸣
国之交，在于民相亲。2026年，中非将共同迎来“中非人文交流年”。届时，包括足球在内的一系列丰富多彩的文化、教育、青年、体育和地方交流活动将全面展开，成为中塞、中非友好交响曲中一个个清脆愉悦的音符，为传承中非友谊注入更加丰沛的“源头活水”。
尾声：面向共同的未来
夕阳西下，为戈雷岛镀上一层温暖的金辉。比赛虽已落幕，但欢声笑语仍在海风中回荡。那棵屹立千年的猴面包树象征着扎根于深厚文明土壤的非洲生命力。
历经风雨，方显真情。中塞、中非关系的友谊之树必将如同那棵雄伟的猴面包树一般，枝繁叶茂，生生不息，共同迎接携手构建新时代全天候中非命运共同体的美好明天。

2025年12月22日，班珠尔天空展开一整片透亮的蓝。驻冈比亚使馆多功能厅内，中冈两国国旗并肩而立，等待着来自冈各界的兄弟姐妹，“中冈友谊沙龙”字样在简洁的视觉设计中显得亲切而庄重——自年初创立以来，这已是使馆举办的第十期中冈友谊沙龙。与会者陆续到来，热情寒暄致意，他们今年赴华参加减贫研修班，怀着憧憬而去，满载收获而归，眼中闪烁出从中国这片土地汲取的光亮。
一、心相近：跨越山海的联结
国会议员巴赫先生刚下车便笑着说：“我已经去过四次中国了，中国就像我的第二个家，来到使馆就像回家一样。我由衷感谢中国对冈比亚等非洲兄弟的帮助。”话语间，满是信赖与热忱。
“四个月前，我以嘉宾身份来到使馆参加中冈青年沙龙，倾听他们的中国故事，那时我还是一位旁观者。四个月以来，我通过参加中国国际新闻交流中心项目，亲眼见证了中国在脱贫等领域的发展成就。今天，我再次来到使馆，也成了中国故事的分享者、中国经验的传播者。”青年记者贾塔的话语中充满感慨。四个月的中国之旅在他心中刻下了深刻印记。
性别、儿童与社会福利部的科利先生赴华培训后专门创作了歌曲《一带一路 共同繁荣》，满怀自豪地向在座嘉宾分享。欢快非洲旋律的曲调里，听得出对中国之行的真挚感悟与深厚情谊。他的分享恰似一把钥匙，打开了众人的话匣子，与会嘉宾纷纷举手发言，踊跃分享自己在减贫领域的所见所闻、所思所获。
二、路相通：照亮发展的星光指引
“三次中国之行彻底改变了我对中国的固有印象。”总统府新闻办主任博江女士语气坚定，“以往对中国的认知多来自西方媒体，亲自到访后，我才看到真实的发展图景，为此我特意在媒体上发表了一篇文章《我眼里的中国》。在扶贫领域，中国秉持‘集中力量办大事’的理念，广泛动员全社会力量共同参与扶贫开发。减贫方案既扎根社区实际需求，又以国家政策部署为行动指引。在此，我也想呼吁冈比亚各界：无论身处何种阶层、分属哪个政党，都应携手并肩，为改善冈比亚人民的生活福祉而努力。”
“中国给我印象最深刻的是‘绿色银行’一词，以‘绿’生‘金’。此外，完善的社会保障制度也令人赞叹——老人能在社区食堂买到物美价廉的食品，安享养老院的照料；留守儿童也能接受完整的教育，在关爱庇护中健康成长。”冈比亚非政府组织联合会主席恩吉夫人的分享，道出了对民生保障的深切关注，也获得了在场嘉宾的认可。
下河区副区长卡马拉先生表示：“我在中国学习到最关键的就是要把人民放在第一位，要搞清楚政府施政的目的是什么，要确保没有一个人掉队。”
同样来自性别、儿童与社会福利部的图雷女士动容地说：“中国有8亿多人成功脱贫，对世界减贫贡献超过70%，这一成就具有重要的世界意义。中国经验告诉我，必须强化赋能妇女与青年。这一群体占冈比亚人口的绝大部分，这些人既是贫困的受害者也是脱贫的中坚力量。而在中国，广大女性撑起了半边天，更在许多岗位上担任领导工作，这让我倍受振奋、鼓舞。”
天色渐晚，谈兴更浓。目光始终聚焦在“方法”与“道路”。嘉宾们各抒己见，在交流中碰撞出思想火花：“中国共产党是有着坚定的政治意愿、决心和能力”“中国的智慧，在于懂得‘一把钥匙开一把锁’，因地制宜施策”“官员要对工作结果负责，衡量工作成功的标准，是人民生活的实际改善，而非空洞的政策声明”“扶贫要重视基础设施建设，打通互联互通堵点”“要强化科技赋能，善用现代科技力量为发展赋能增效”“更要聚焦教育、卫生、农业等核心领域，筑牢民生根基”。大家侃侃而谈，引发共鸣。
三、播种希望：当经验落地生根
“贫困并不可怕，要有战胜它的勇气”“中国可以，冈比亚也能行”“中国的经验给了我们信心和希望”。这些不再是简单的口号，而是沙龙孕育出的共同信念——中国的减贫经验作为宝贵的国际公共产品，正等待在冈比亚这片土地上找到适配的土壤，生长出属于冈比亚发展的累累硕果。
沙龙尾声，一个清澈的声音点亮了全场。最年轻的特邀嘉宾、青年议会议长西萨沃女士举起手，眼神明亮：“虽然我还没去过中国，但听完大家分享，我也很想去看看！”笑声与掌声顿时漫开。刘晋大使立即表示，欢迎你明年去中国！
活动结束前，大家簇拥着面对镜头，用略显生涩却无比真挚的中文齐声道：“3、2、1——你好！”那声“你好”穿越了语言的距离，成为这个夜晚最温暖的注脚。
窗外，夜色渐浓，来自大西洋的海风轻抚着“微笑海岸”。夜空中星光璀璨，预示明天冈比亚将拥有一个晴空万里的好天气。
2026年是中非人文交流年。中冈友谊沙龙还会继续办下去。从心与心相知相近，到理念与理念同频共振，在一次次分享与倾听中，中冈友好的种子、发展希望的嫩芽，正悄然在两国人民心中生长。
2026年还是两国复交十周年，站在新的历史起点，中冈关系未来之路将如习近平主席去年会见巴罗总统时所提出的，中冈已经成为发展振兴道路上的好朋友、好伙伴，我们要促进两国关系行稳致远。

2025年12月2日，天朗气清，惠风和畅，在伊拉克库尔德地区的金色秋光下，驻埃尔比勒总领馆、库区政府及伊拉克中资企业商会库区分会的中外代表们齐聚一堂，共同庆祝库区首座中式风格公园——中国友谊园建成开园。
上午十时，各方代表为友谊园剪彩，并一同参观园内景致与设施。尽管时值深秋，园中依然花木繁茂、生机盎然。随后，嘉宾们聚集在公园标志性凉亭周围，聆听总领馆、中资企业及库区政府代表致辞。现场十余家媒体全程直播报道，使开园仪式成为当地备受关注的社会盛事。
一、应时共建：从倡议到落地的绿色行动
伊拉克库区气候干燥炎热少雨，夏季漫长且持续高温，平均气温常在40摄氏度以上，是受全球候变化影响最显著的地区之一。面对日益加剧的气候挑战，两年前，库区政府向各国驻当地外交和领事机构发出倡议，呼吁共建城市公园，促进绿色发展。中国驻埃尔比勒总领馆率先响应，也是迄今唯一响应并付诸实际行动的外国机构。
总领馆联合苏州中材、中交一公局、中石化、中国电建等13家中资企业，共同捐资40余万美元，投入人力物力，于2024年12月20日正式启动工程建设。值得一提的是，承担设计与建设任务的中交一公局，在尚未于库区开展正式业务的情况下，便积极投身该项目，体现了中资企业的社会责任担当。
二、精心筑园：从荒芜土地到葱郁花园
项目建设初期，选址处仅为一片荒芜土地，仅有一座发电站与数间平房，附近居民若想亲近自然、游玩放松，需要前往几个街区外的萨米公园甚至更远。总领馆距离园址约一公里，我们时常经过此地，目睹了公园从无到有、并非一帆风顺的建设过程。施工高峰期正值酷暑，为避开高温，工人们常在傍晚甚至夜间作业；园区严重缺水，需每日运水浇灌以保障植物存活；为坚持高标准、高质量，预算多次调整，企业主动承担了额外成本。看似寻常最奇崛，成如容易却艰辛。在各方共同努力下，公园有如一个“孩子”，十月怀胎，终于“呱呱坠地”。
如今，这里实现了从荒地到花园的华美转变，从裸露的黄土到亭台玉立、花枝招展，从“一无所有”到设施齐备、功能完善，从“无人问津”到游人如织、笑语盈盈，正成为闹市中难得休闲的好去处，既带来了鸟语花香，也迎来了欢声笑语。草木蔓发，春山可望，在这片土地上生长的不仅是绿色、花草、树木，更是中国同伊拉克库区人民间的深厚友好的感情。
三、绿色人文：绿色发展与文化交融
友谊园在设计建设中始终贯彻绿色、低碳、可持续的理念。面对当地缺水少电的现状，项目坚持因地制宜，打造了一座生态友好、功能复合、文化包容的绿色空间。
公园精心挑选、种植3500株耐旱植物，绿地面积达9000平米，覆盖率达75%，并铺设了智能灌溉系统，让每一寸土地和每一棵植株都得到精准呵护。全部照明采用太阳能供电，包括62套庭院灯、草坪灯及100套照树灯，白天储能、夜晚亮灯，将低碳落实到每个细节。铺设1400米步道与400米塑胶跑道，为居民提供晨昏散步、健身休闲的舒适场所。
公园注重社区环境和人文底蕴的融合，曲径通幽、移步换景的中式美学自然地融入库区城市肌理，与古朴厚重的埃尔比勒老城风格交相辉映。凉亭与不远处的宣礼塔遥相对望，勾勒出一幅文明对话的和谐图景。园内灌溉系统、太阳能设备、凉亭、友谊石等均从国内运抵，跨越山海，在此重组成型，让绿色理念真正落地生根，也让中国文化和库尔德文化在此自然交融。
四、润物无声：一座园子与一片民心
“国之交在于民相亲，民相亲在于心相通。”中国友谊园不仅是一项景观工程，更是一项有温度、可感知的“小而美”民生项目。它将“以人民为中心”和“绿色发展”理念转化为可触可感的绿意、灯光与活动空间，直接惠及当地百姓，成为居民推窗见绿、出门入园的生活福祉，也成为双方友谊与合作的生动象征。
每当夜幕降临，园内太阳能灯渐次亮起，孩童奔跑嬉笑，友人并肩漫步，长者在亭中闲坐叙旧，青年在步道上挥汗奔跑……这些平凡而温馨的场景，如春风化雨，润物无声，成为双方民心相通最真实、最生动的写照。友谊园承载着希望，传递着温情，也将随着四季流转，持续滋养这份跨越山海的真挚情谊。

相知无远近，万里尚为邻。3000年前，源自中国南方的南岛语族先民远渡重洋抵达萨摩亚。一个半世纪前，华人先辈在萨摩亚开启了与当地人民血脉相融的历史。1975年11月6日，萨摩亚独立国与中华人民共和国正式建交，这个遥守在南太平洋的明珠岛屿，成为本区域最早张开双臂拥抱新中国的国家之一。这份血脉相亲与信任相守延续至今，历经半个世纪，依然火热炽烈，中萨友好也在交往中结出丰硕果实。今年是中萨建交50周年，两国联合开展了系列庆祝活动，互动中两国互信合作之美更加丰满多彩。
一、新春致辞开启周年，继往开来，共启新程。
新年伊始，萨国家元首图伊马莱阿利法诺致信习近平主席，向中国政府和人民致以新春祝福，表示中国是萨的重要朋友和亲密的发展伙伴，期待中萨关系取得新发展。习主席复函致谢并表示，今年是中萨建交50周年，双边关系发展面临新的机遇，愿与元首一道努力，推动中萨全面战略伙伴关系不断迈上新台阶，更好造福两国人民。
新的一年在这样祥和的气象中拉开了序幕。萨摩亚温暖的阳光斜照，海风轻拂，人们各安其所。走在首都阿皮亚的瓦伊泰勒街上，沿途是中萨务实合作的硕果：文化艺术中心、阿皮亚小学和国立医院。穿岛公路翻越乌波卢岛的中心山脉，连接南北两边海岸。矗立在市中心的新旧政府大楼，承载着整个国家的运转。繁忙的法勒奥罗机场迎来送往，架起国际交往的桥梁。它们见证了五十年中萨友好合作，片瓦间流露的是真情不言，历经岁月依然炽热浓烈。
中萨友好不在于口号响亮，而是实实在在的相守相亲。中萨1975年建交以来，在两国政府共同努力和两国人民大力支持下，双边关系一直稳定健康发展，走在中国与太平洋岛国关系前列。2008年汶川地震发生后，萨摩亚在太平洋岛国中第一个向中国捐款相助，其中真情不言自明。展望未来，中萨相互尊重、共同发展的全面战略伙伴关系前景广阔。
二、互免签证协议生效，相守以诚，万里为邻。
4月2日，《中华人民共和国政府和萨摩亚独立国政府关于互免签证的协定》正式生效，这是建交50周年的又一标志性事件，是双边关系的里程碑。每当我们向来咨询的萨摩亚人告知中国免签时，心中是油然而生的亲切、感动与自豪。真诚互信胜过千言万语，人心相连可跨越现实的国界。中萨互信友好，实实在在地便利了两国人员往来、经贸合作和文化交流。
在太平洋岛国地区，对中国实施普通护照持有者免签政策的国家已有8个，我们的朋友圈逐渐壮大，我们的友好更拉近了人民的距离。修文德以来远人，协和万邦。构建更加紧密的中国—太平洋岛国命运共同体，我们一直在路上。
三、纪念作品精彩纷呈，中萨智慧，凝萃为美。
为彰显两国"风雨同舟、合作共赢"的伙伴精神，驻萨摩亚大使馆主办中萨建交50周年徽标设计大赛，面向中国与萨摩亚公众征集设计并选拔敲定了最终作品。费明星大使与菲娅梅前总理共同为徽标揭幕。
徽标设计理念为海上丝绸之路的现代延续、波利尼西亚文化的现代演绎，形象上采用长城砖纹、青花瓷回纹和萨摩亚编织纹的拓扑融合，中萨两国国花共生其中，色彩上以中国红、青花瓷与碧绿海洋三色和谐渐变，数字“50”采用莫比乌斯环设计突出两国友谊无穷无尽的美好祝愿，体现了两国和合共生的文明互鉴和同心协力的发展愿景。
6月2日，纪念徽标亮相萨摩亚独立63周年庆典，旗手高举徽标旗牌，带领使馆及华侨华人和中资机构代表列队走过游行大道，赢得全场欢呼喝彩。印制着徽标的纪念品，也走进萨摩亚的大街小巷。中萨智慧凝结成的美丽，跃动在人群中，迎接炽热的阳与爽快的雨，以艺术作品之永存，纪念中萨友谊之不朽。
四、高层致贺各界共庆，国家相亲，人民相守。
11月6日，习近平主席与萨国家元首图伊马莱阿利法诺、李强总理与萨总理拉乌利互致贺信，两国领导人高屋建瓴，为中萨半个世纪的交往作出高度评价，为中萨未来发展擘画了美好蓝图。
萨摩亚政府发布纪念视频，感谢中国的长期无私援助。费明星大使在人民日报发表署名文章《共创中萨关系美好未来》，指出两国互尊互信、互利共赢、互学互鉴，中萨关系始终稳步前行、历久弥坚。萨摩亚华人商会在萨主流媒体特别刊登庆祝建交50周年纪念版面，代表华侨华人致贺。
同日，两国联合发行纪念邮票，邮票主体以两国特色鸟类为核心设计元素，分别为中国四川丹巴县“白马鸡”和萨摩亚国鸟“齿嘴鸠”，以两国独特的自然生态之美，传递了两国人民深厚的友谊。
五十年相互尊重，携手而伴，说易行难。正是因为两国互尊互信，各界人民相亲相守，才筑造了坚实的友谊之船。
五、规模庆典盛大庄严，以礼为赞，以情致远。
11月21日，中国使馆与萨摩亚政府联合主办庆祝中国与萨摩亚建交50周年仪式，同时中国援建的阿皮亚、圣特蕾莎、蕾佩亚三所小学正式竣工，一并在庆典上移交。
萨政府高度重视此项典礼，深度参与仪式筹备设计，打造了近年来萨与建交国联合庆祝典礼的最高仪式。庄严的号角、激昂的鼓点以及热烈的响棍，伴随着图伊马莱阿利法诺元首、莫利波拉副总理等主宾到场，盛典正式开启。费大使与莫利波拉副总理盛赞中萨关系五十周年成就，与各位来宾共同见证周年庆典与小学移交。国礼Fa'aaloaloga仪式将整个庆典推向高潮，在声声嘹亮的萨摩亚语祭词中，主礼人穿着传统草裙与帽饰，向他们敬爱的中国友人献上了祭猪、编织草席与长幅树皮画。他们将敬意融进了萨摩亚传统的最高艺术品，以表最诚挚的感谢。来宾们共同参观新落成的阿皮亚小学，在窗明几净的教室中、在宽阔平坦的操场上，畅想下一代的美好愿景与中萨友好的代代传承。
典礼后，在萨摩亚文化艺术中心举行了中萨联合文艺汇演，中萨传统艺术节目精彩纷呈，为观众呈现了一场文艺盛宴。全场沸腾热舞，大家沉醉在欢乐的海洋，为彼此的情谊干杯祝祷。
12月4日，萨摩亚驻华使馆在北京主办了庆祝中萨建交50周年招待会，外交部部长助理蔡伟与萨摩亚驻华大使马里纳共同出席，祝愿中萨友谊长青，希望两国合作进一步深入、双边关系再上新台阶。两场活动遥相呼应，让人为之感动，我们远隔万里的坚持相守，让中萨人民得以敞开心怀、拥抱彼此。倾盖如故、温暖相知，跨越山海的情谊，是我们现在的相知相守，也是我们下一代乃至世世代代中萨人民的宝贵财富。
中萨互信合作五十年，成果在农渔业、教育文化、医疗、基建等各领域全面开花。今年，萨摩亚华人历史展在中国援建的文化艺术中心盛大开幕，“我眼中的中国”视频大赛使“中国印象”更加清晰，中国的援助直抵萨摩亚登革热抗疫一线。未来，两国将继续深入务实合作，共享发展机遇与发展成果。
当今世界百年变局加速演进，人类所面临共同挑战加剧。惟今之势，只有携手共渡才是正道。山川异域，风月同天。岂曰无衣，与子同袍。中萨虽远隔重洋，但心之相守可跨山越海，万里比邻。在人类命运共同体理念的号召下，在四大全球倡议的引领下，在“四个充分尊重”的基础上，中萨必将赓续历史，共创未来五十年的辉煌。

习近平发表题为《携手推进现代化，共筑命运共同体》的主旨讲话。
习近平首先代表中国政府和中国人民对出席峰会的外方嘉宾表示热烈欢迎。
习近平指出，在这收获的季节，很高兴同各位新老朋友相聚北京，共商新时代中非友好合作大计。中非友好穿越时空、跨越山海、薪火相传。中非合作论坛成立24年来特别是新时代以来，中国同非洲兄弟姐妹们本着真实亲诚理念，在世界百年变局中肩并肩、手拉手，坚定捍卫彼此正当权益；在经济全球化大潮中强筋骨、壮体魄，累累硕果惠及中非亿万百姓；在大灾大疫面前同甘苦、共拼搏，书写了一个个中非友好的感人故事；始终相互理解、彼此支持，树立了新型国际关系的典范。经过近70年辛勤耕耘，中非关系正处于历史最好时期。面向未来，中方提议将中国同所有非洲建交国的双边关系提升到战略关系层面，将中非关系整体定位提升至新时代全天候中非命运共同体。
习近平指出，实现现代化是世界各国不可剥夺的权利。中国正坚定不移以中国式现代化全面推进强国建设、民族复兴伟业。非洲也正朝着非盟《2063年议程》描绘的现代化目标稳步迈进。中非共逐现代化之梦，必将掀起全球南方的现代化热潮，谱写构建人类命运共同体的崭新篇章。
习近平提出，中非要携手推进“六个现代化”。
——要携手推进公正合理的现代化。推进国家现代化建设，既要遵循现代化一般规律，更要符合本国实际。中方愿同非方加强治国理政经验交流，支持各国探索适合本国国情的现代化道路，确保各国权利平等、机会平等。
——要携手推进开放共赢的现代化。互利合作是符合各国长远和根本利益的阳光大道。中方愿同非方深化工业、农业、基础设施、贸易投资等领域合作，树立高质量共建“一带一路”的标杆，共同打造落实全球发展倡议的样板。
——要携手推进人民至上的现代化。实现人的自由全面发展是现代化的最终目标。中方愿同非方积极开展人才培养、减贫、就业等领域合作，提升人民在现代化进程中的获得感、幸福感、安全感，共同推动现代化惠及全体人民。
——要携手推进多元包容的现代化。实现物质文明和精神文明协调发展是现代化的崇高追求。中方愿同非方密切人文交流，倡导不同文明相互尊重、包容共存，共同推动全球文明倡议结出更多硕果。
——要携手推进生态友好的现代化。绿色发展是新时代现代化的鲜明标识。中方愿帮助非方打造“绿色增长引擎”，缩小能源可及性差距，坚持共同但有区别的责任原则，共同推动全球绿色低碳转型。
——要携手推进和平安全的现代化。现代化离不开和平稳定的发展环境。中方愿帮助非洲提升自主维护和平稳定的能力，推动全球安全倡议率先在非洲落地，促进高质量发展和高水平安全良性互动，共同维护世界和平稳定。
习近平强调，中国和非洲占世界总人口的三分之一，没有中非的现代化，就没有世界的现代化。未来3年，中方愿同非方携手推进现代化十大伙伴行动，深化中非合作，引领全球南方现代化。
第一，文明互鉴伙伴行动。中方愿同非方打造治国理政经验交流平台，设立中非发展知识网络和25个中非研究中心，邀请1000名非洲政党人士来华交流。
第二，贸易繁荣伙伴行动。中方愿主动单方面扩大市场开放，决定给予包括33个非洲国家在内的所有同中国建交的最不发达国家100%税目产品零关税待遇，推动中国大市场成为非洲大机遇。扩大非洲农产品准入，深化电商等领域合作，实施“中非质量提升计划”。中方愿同非方商签共同发展经济伙伴关系框架协定，为中非贸易投资提供长期、稳定、可预期的制度保障。
第三，产业链合作伙伴行动。中方愿同非方打造产业合作增长圈，着力建设中非经贸深度合作先行区，启动“非洲中小企业赋能计划”。共建中非数字技术合作中心，建设20个数字示范项目。
第四，互联互通伙伴行动。中方愿在非洲实施30个基础设施联通项目，携手推进高质量共建“一带一路”，打造陆海联动、协同发展的中非互联互通网络。为非洲大陆自由贸易区建设提供帮助，深化物流和金融合作，助力非洲跨区域发展。
第五，发展合作伙伴行动。中方愿和非方共同发表在全球发展倡议框架内深化合作的联合声明，实施1000个“小而美”民生项目。注资中国－世界银行伙伴关系基金。支持举办2026年青奥会和2027年非洲杯，促进发展成果更好惠及中非人民。
第六，卫生健康伙伴行动。中方愿同非方成立中非医院联盟，共建联合医学中心。向非洲派遣2000名医疗队员，实施20个医疗卫生和抗疟项目，推动中国企业投资药品生产，继续对非洲遭遇的疫情提供力所能及的帮助。支持非洲疾控中心建设，提升非洲各国公共卫生能力。
第七，兴农惠民伙伴行动。中方将向非洲提供10亿元人民币紧急粮食援助，建设10万亩农业标准化示范区，派遣500名农业专家，建设中非农业科技创新联盟。实施500个公益项目。鼓励中非企业“双向奔赴”投资创业，为非洲创造不少于100万个就业岗位。
第八，人文交流伙伴行动。中方愿同非方深入推进“未来非洲职业教育”计划，共建工程技术学院，建设10个“鲁班工坊”。重点面向非洲妇女和青年，提供6万个研修名额。共同实施中非“文化丝路”计划和“广电视听创新合作计划”。将2026年确定为“中非人文交流年”。
第九，绿色发展伙伴行动。中方愿在非洲实施30个清洁能源项目，建设气象早期预警业务平台，开展防灾减灾救灾和生物多样性保护合作。设立中非和平利用核技术论坛，开展卫星遥感、月球和深空探测合作，助力非洲实现绿色发展。
第十，安全共筑伙伴行动。中方愿同非方建立落实全球安全倡议伙伴关系，为非方培训6000名军队人才和1000名警务执法人员，邀请500名青年军官访华。开展中非军队联演联训、联合巡航，实施“助力非洲摆脱雷患行动”，共同维护人员和项目安全。
为推动“十大伙伴行动”实施，中国政府愿为中非各领域务实合作提供强有力支持。
习近平最后强调，中国共产党二十届三中全会对进一步全面深化改革、推进中国式现代化作出系统部署。这将进一步深刻改变中国，也必将为非洲国家、为中非共逐现代化之梦提供新机遇、注入新动能。非洲有句谚语“同路人才是真朋友”。现代化道路上一个都不能少，一国都不能掉队。让我们凝聚起28亿多中非人民的磅礴力量，在现代化征程上携手同行，以中非现代化助力全球南方现代化，绘就人类发展史上崭新画卷，共同推动世界走向和平、安全、繁荣、进步的光明前景！
中非合作论坛共同主席国塞内加尔总统法耶，非盟轮值主席国毛里塔尼亚总统加兹瓦尼，非洲次区域代表南非总统拉马福萨、刚果（布）总统萨苏、尼日利亚总统提努布、坦桑尼亚总统哈桑，峰会特邀嘉宾、联合国秘书长古特雷斯，非盟委员会主席法基也在开幕式致辞。
非方领导人感谢中方主办此次中非合作论坛北京峰会，高度评价非中深厚传统友谊和中非合作论坛成立以来特别是2018年北京峰会以来取得的积极成果，高度赞赏习近平主席提出中非携手推进现代化“十大伙伴行动”。他们表示，中非合作论坛不仅是促进非中伙伴关系发展的有效平台，也已经成为引领南南合作的光辉典范。论坛合作基于友谊、尊重和互利共赢，中国对非合作不带任何政治附加条件，极大促进了非洲国家互联互通和经济社会发展。在当前复杂动荡国际形势下，深化对华合作更加成为非洲国家实现安全、稳定和可持续发展的希望。非中理念相近。非方高度赞赏并完全支持习近平主席提出的构建人类命运共同体重要理念和共建“一带一路”倡议、全球发展倡议、全球安全倡议、全球文明倡议，愿同中方共同倡导全人类共同价值，支持各国探索符合本国国情的现代化道路。非方坚定奉行一个中国政策，坚定支持中国政府为实现国家统一所作的一切努力，坚决反对外部势力借台湾、人权等问题干涉中国内政。非方祝贺中国共产党二十届三中全会成功召开，相信中国进一步全面深化改革、推进中国式现代化将为包括非洲国家在内的世界各国带来更多发展机遇。非方愿同中方继续秉持和平共处五项原则和中非友好合作精神，积极落实此次峰会成果，携手推进工业化和农业现代化，构建新时代全天候非中命运共同体，共同迈向和平、安全、繁荣、进步的光明前景。
峰会通过《关于共筑新时代全天候中非命运共同体的北京宣言》《中非合作论坛－北京行动计划（2025－2027）》。
中非合作论坛非方成员国国家元首、政府首脑、代表团团长及国际和地区组织负责人等中外各界人士3200余人出席开幕式。

（2024年9月5日 北京）
中华人民共和国主席 习近平
尊敬的法耶总统，
尊敬的非洲联盟轮值主席加兹瓦尼总统，
尊敬的各位国家元首、政府首脑、代表团团长，
尊敬的联合国秘书长古特雷斯先生，
尊敬的非洲联盟委员会主席法基先生，
各位朋友、各位嘉宾：
春华秋实，岁物丰成。在这收获的季节，很高兴同各位新老朋友相聚北京，共商新时代中非友好合作大计。首先，我代表中国政府和中国人民，对大家的到来表示热烈欢迎！
中非友好穿越时空、跨越山海、薪火相传。2000年中非合作论坛成立，在中非关系史上具有重要里程碑意义。24年来特别是新时代以来，中国同非洲兄弟姐妹们本着真实亲诚理念，携手前行。我们在世界百年变局中肩并肩、手拉手，坚定捍卫彼此正当权益；我们在经济全球化大潮中强筋骨、壮体魄，累累硕果惠及中非亿万百姓；我们在大灾大疫面前同甘苦、共拼搏，书写了一个个中非友好的感人故事；我们始终相互理解、彼此支持，树立了新型国际关系的典范。
经过近70年的辛勤耕耘，中非关系正处于历史最好时期。面向未来，我提议，将中国同所有非洲建交国的双边关系提升到战略关系层面，将中非关系整体定位提升至新时代全天候中非命运共同体！
各位朋友、各位嘉宾！
实现现代化是世界各国不可剥夺的权利。西方现代化进程曾给广大发展中国家带来了深重苦难。第二次世界大战结束后，以中国和非洲为代表的第三世界国家相继实现独立和发展，不断纠正现代化进程中的历史不公。中华人民共和国即将迎来75周年华诞，正坚定不移以中国式现代化全面推进强国建设、民族复兴伟业。非洲也正经历新的觉醒，朝着非盟《2063年议程》描绘的现代化目标稳步迈进。中非共逐现代化之梦，必将掀起“全球南方”现代化热潮，谱写构建人类命运共同体的崭新篇章。
—— 要携手推进公正合理的现代化。推进国家现代化建设，既要遵循现代化一般规律，更要符合本国实际。中方愿同非方加强治国理政经验交流，支持各国探索适合本国国情的现代化道路，确保各国权利平等、机会平等。

今年7月，中国共产党二十届三中全会成功召开，对进一步全面深化改革、推进中国式现代化作出系统部署。这将进一步深刻改变中国，也必将为非洲国家、为中非共逐现代化之梦提供新机遇、注入新动能。
非洲有句谚语“同路人才是真朋友”。现代化道路上一个都不能少，一国都不能掉队。让我们凝聚起28亿多中非人民的磅礴力量，在现代化征程上携手同行，以中非现代化助力“全球南方”现代化，绘就人类发展史上崭新画卷，共同推动世界走向和平、安全、繁荣、进步的光明前景!
谢谢。

在历史演进重大关头开拓中国特色大国外交新境界
来源：直通非洲　发布：2025-12-31 00:32
——在2025年国际形势与中国外交研讨会上的主旨发言
王  毅
（2025年12月30日，北京）
各位专家，各位朋友：
大家好！很高兴岁末年初再次相聚，一道探讨国际形势，盘点中国外交。
2025年是世界反法西斯战争胜利80周年，也是联合国成立80周年。在这个厚重的历史性年份，世界再次来到何去何从的重要关口。
这一年，国际格局演变走向重要分水岭，单极霸权不得人心，多极世界扑面而来，百年变局下的新旧矛盾集中暴发，进步还是倒退之争日趋激烈。
这一年，经济全球化遭遇严重冲击，关税战破坏国际贸易规则，扰乱全球经济秩序，开放还是封闭之选迫在眉睫。
这一年，全球局部战争和跨境冲突频发，创下二战结束以来新高，地缘政治动荡持续蔓延，和平还是战争之问扣动人心。
面对历史演进新关口，我们在以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导下，高举构建人类命运共同体旗帜，以元首外交为战略引领，用最大诚意团结世界进步力量，尽最大努力汇聚和平发展能量，保和平、促合作、应变局、担道义，为中华民族谋复兴，为动荡世界谋大同，不断开创中国特色大国外交新境界。
面对世界和平乱局，中国是稳定锚。百年变局加速演进，国际关系动荡变革，大国发生冲突对抗的风险明显上升。
中国作为世界主要大国、联合国安理会常任理事国，始终以维护世界和平为己任，身体力行推动构建新型大国关系，劝和促谈致力热点问题降温，坚持以同球共济超越地缘博弈，为维护世界和平展现大国担当。
过去一年，中美关系历经起伏震荡，实现了总体动态稳定，这符合中美两国人民共同利益，符合国际社会共同期待；中俄关系更加坚如磐石，保持高水平稳健运行，两国领导人在历史性年份实现互访，凸显中俄相互信任、相互支撑的全面战略协作伙伴关系真谛；中欧总结建交50年合作经验，再次确认伙伴关系基本定位；全球南方10国正式加入“金砖伙伴圈”，20个成员的“金砖大家庭”不断兴旺，“大金砖合作”越发红火。
乌克兰危机延宕已接近4年。中方以习近平主席提出的“四个应该”为基本遵循，坚持不懈为和平创造条件，汇聚共识。作为乌克兰危机“和平之友”的倡导者之一，我们真诚欢迎一切有利于和平解决危机的努力，同其他各方一道为之积极奔走呼吁。现在，谈判的窗口已经打开，和平的曙光就在前面。尽管前进道路仍然崎岖坎坷，但中方愿继续发挥建设性作用，期待达成全面、持久、有约束力的和平协议，消除矛盾冲突的根源，实现欧洲长治久安。
面对周边环境新局，中国是主心骨。在变乱交织的世界中，亚洲成为举世公认的全球发展繁荣高地，我国同周边国家关系处于近代以来最好的时期。同时，周边格局和世界变局深度联动，维护周边繁荣稳定需要付出不懈努力。
在周边形势演变关键时刻，党中央召开新中国成立以来首次周边工作会议，明确周边在中华民族伟大复兴进程中的重要定位，提出建设和平、安宁、繁荣、美丽、友好“五大家园”的努力方向，确立构建周边命运共同体的总体目标，发出携手周边国家共创美好未来的战略信号，为我国同周边国家关系发展注入新的强劲动力。
习近平主席今年主场外交和重要出访着眼周边。东南亚之行以点带面，巩固同东盟国家睦邻友好，推进互利合作，迎接共同挑战。俄罗斯之行传承中俄友谊、捍卫历史正义，把两大邻国互信合作提升到新水平。中亚之行首提“中国—中亚精神”，签署永久睦邻友好合作条约，筑牢西北方向长期稳定根基。东北亚之行引领亚太务实合作，推动中韩关系改善发展。今年，我们还邀请印度、朝鲜领导人来华，中印关系呈现向好发展势头，中朝传统友谊得到巩固弘扬。习近平主席主持上海合作组织天津峰会取得圆满成功，制定上合组织未来10年发展战略，落地4个地区安全中心，创设6个合作平台，签署数十份各领域合作文件。我国同周边国家的交往正迈入加快构建命运共同体的新时期。
一年来的周边关系发展和周边环境演变再次证明，与中国为邻是好事、幸事。中国不在周边搞地缘争夺，而是致力于睦邻安邻富邻；不在周边搞势力范围，而是构建命运共同体；不在周边搞一言堂，而是践行大家的事一起商量着办。中国的周边，堪称睦邻友好的示范区。
面对国际秩序变局，中国是定盘星。联合国风雨兼程80年，国际体系变革按下快进键。面对时代发展大潮，有人极力踩刹车，有人试图开倒车，而中国的选择是面向未来，携手各方共建人类命运共同体，推动国际秩序朝着更加公正合理的方向发展。
构建人类命运共同体是习近平外交思想的核心理念，顺应时代发展进步潮流，符合中国人民和世界各国人民共同利益。今年胜利召开的中国共产党第二十届四中全会通过的“十五五”规划建议，以构建人类命运共同体为主线，部署未来五年的对外工作，展现出中国为人类谋进步、为世界谋大同的坚定信念和实际行动。
2025年，世界见证了全球治理变革的“中国时刻”。习近平主席郑重提出全球治理倡议，倡导主权平等、国际法治、多边主义、以人为本、行动导向五大理念，为推动构建更加公正合理的全球治理体系提出中国方案，为重振联合国的核心地位和主导作用注入中国动力。这一倡议的提出正当其时，切中当今世界迫切需求，得到150多个国家和国际组织迅速响应支持。中国隆重纪念中国人民抗日战争暨世界反法西斯战争胜利80周年，习近平主席发表重要讲话，弘扬伟大抗战精神，坚持正确二战史观，发出正义必胜、和平必胜、人民必胜的时代强音。习近平主席专门出席在北京举办的全球妇女峰会，强调要为加速妇女发展新进程凝聚更广泛共识、开辟更广阔道路。我国会同30多个国家共同创立国际调解院，成为首个专门以调解方式解决国际争端的政府间国际组织，呼应联合国宪章要求，为各国搭建起化解分歧的新平台。中国倡导成立世界人工智能合作组织，将致力于加强全球南方人工智能能力建设，弥合“智能鸿沟”，加快人工智能全球治理进程。
然而，就在这个世界各国人民汲取历史教训、共谋和平发展的特殊年份，当年发动侵华战争的日本，不仅不深刻反省自身犯下的种种罪行，其现职领导人竟然公开挑战中国领土主权、挑战二战历史结论、挑战战后国际秩序。对此，所有爱好和平的国家、所有不希望悲剧重演的人民都绝不答应。我们必须高度警惕日本军国主义沉渣泛起，必须坚决捍卫用鲜血换来的二战胜利成果，必须有效维护来之不易的和平稳定。
面对全球发展困局，中国是主引擎。全球经济增速放缓，单边主义、保护主义横行，国际经贸秩序遭受严重冲击，各国发展面临重大挑战。中国经济顶压前行、向新向优，以强大韧性和充沛活力为世界提供支撑，以更高水平对外开放包括单边开放与世界分享机遇，中国对世界经济增长贡献率继续保持在30%左右，高于七国集团总和，成为全球发展爬坡脱困的主要推进器。
过去一年，我们大力推进高质量共建“一带一路”，同南亚、拉美、中亚多个国家新签合作规划和行动计划，对共建“一带一路”国家非金融类直接投资同比增长20%以上。坦赞铁路激活续写中非友谊新丰碑，中吉乌铁路建设孕育区域联通新前景，中欧班列累计开行12万列，一条又一条双向奔赴的“黄金通道”加速延伸拓展。
过去一年，我们扛起促进全球发展重任，连续举办进博会、服贸会、消博会，海南自贸港正式启动全岛封关，同东盟全面完成并签署自贸区3.0升级版议定书，同非洲持续实施“十大伙伴行动”，同拉美国家建设“五大工程”，同阿拉伯国家构建“五大合作格局”，同太平洋岛国形成七大合作平台架构，成功举行首次东盟—中国—海合会峰会，同各方结成更紧密发展合作伙伴。
过去一年，我们克服外部环境干扰和挑战，向需要支持和帮助的国际伙伴伸出援手，对所有最不发达国家和非洲国家实施“零关税”，宣布在坚持发展中国家定位的同时，不在世贸组织谈判中寻求新的特殊和差别待遇，主动让利于全球南方国家，承担起中国的国际责任。
过去一年，我们广迎四方客，持续扩容免签“朋友圈”，迄今已对48国实施单方面免签、对55国实施过境免签，今年前三季度免签入境外国人超过2000万、同比增长50%以上，开创了中外人文交流新局面。中国同世界的交流交融不断加深，世界投向中国的目光更加理性友善。
面对国际道义危局，中国是压舱石。强权不是公理，赢者不能通吃；良知不会泯灭，公道自在人间。中国外交弘扬和平、发展、公平、正义、民主、自由的全人类共同价值，致力在国际上守正道、扬公道、行大道，坚定守护国际道义的底线。
为寻求更加持久的和平，我们践行客观公正、标本兼治的中国特色热点问题解决之道，坚持不干涉内政、不拱火浇油、不拉偏架、不谋私利，一秉诚意斡旋缅北、伊核、印巴、巴以等矛盾以及最近的柬泰冲突。我们的坚持和努力经得起历史检验。国际社会促成加沙停火的努力值得欢迎，但世界仍欠巴勒斯坦一个公道。巴勒斯坦问题不能再次被边缘化，巴勒斯坦人民争取民族合法权利的事业不能无果而终，“巴人所有、巴人治巴”的原则必须坚持，“两国方案”仍是全面、公正、持久解决巴勒斯坦问题的唯一正确选择。
为争取一个更平等的世界，我们在事关国际道义的大是大非问题上坚定站在历史正确一边，旗帜鲜明反对霸权主义和强权政治，向遭受不公的国家提供力所能及的道义和行动支持。关税战、贸易战损害各国正当权益，损害多边贸易体制。我们挺身而出，既是为了维护自身正当权益，更是为了捍卫国际公平正义。
各位专家，各位朋友：
中美关系是当今世界最重要的双边关系之一。中美两国的战略选择，影响世界历史的演进方向。一年来，我们坚持从自身与世界的整体和长远利益出发看待和处理对美关系，在重大原则问题上立场坚定、态度鲜明，在涉及中国核心利益的问题上针锋相对、寸步不让，同时同美方接触对话、寻求合作，推动美方理性客观看待中国，通过协商对话解决双方分歧。习近平主席同特朗普总统4次通话、多次通信，在韩国釜山会晤期间就事关中美关系以及世界和平与发展的重大问题深入沟通，引领中美关系巨轮穿越急流险滩、保持正确航向。
一年来中美关系发展的实践表明，能不能做到相互尊重、和平共处、合作共赢，是中美关系能否稳定发展、造福世界的关键所在。中美合则两利、斗则俱伤，居高临下行不通，言行不一不可取。中美必须在平等、尊重、互惠基础上寻找解决各自关切的办法，探索出两个大国的正确相处之道。
台湾问题是中国的内政，是中国核心利益中的核心。针对“台独”势力的不断挑衅以及美国大规模对台售武，我们当然要坚决反对、有力反制。今年是台湾回归祖国80周年，实现祖国完全统一，是在依法维护国家的主权和领土完整，是我们必须完成的历史使命。我们看到，越来越多的国家和中国站在一起，不仅重申坚持一个中国原则、承认台湾是中国的领土，还明确反对一切“台独”分裂行径，支持中国统一大业。任何企图阻挡这一历史大势的倒行逆施都必将以失败而告终。
中国特色大国外交2025年的奋斗历程，让我们比以往任何时候都更加深切地感受到：中国与世界的关系正在朝着更加积极的方向发展，中国的国际影响力、创新引领力、道义感召力显著提升。今天的中国外交之所以从容自信、破浪前行，关键在于习近平主席领航掌舵，关键在于习近平外交思想科学指引，关键在于党中央集中统一领导，同时也在于广大人民群众的大力支持，在于中国的外交理念始终占据国际道义的制高点。
各位专家，各位朋友：
“十五五”时期是基本实现社会主义现代化夯实基础、全面发力的关键时期，中国与世界关系进入我们可以为人类发展进步作出更大贡献的新阶段。2026年作为“十五五”开局之年，中国特色大国外交要更有作为。
第一，我们将为国家发展民族振兴提供更坚实战略支撑。“十五五”时期，我国发展将与世界百年变局进一步交织联动，国际形势深刻影响国内发展，中国发展深度牵动国际格局。
服务好“十五五”起步开局是明年外交工作重要使命。我们将增强历史主动，提高政治站位，紧密对标党和国家发展新目标，坚决完成元首外交新任务，以系统观念把握百年变局新动向，有力服务高质量发展，积极推进高水平对外开放，有效化解外部风险挑战，助力我国在激烈国际竞争中继续赢得战略主动。我们将把中国人民的利益与世界各国人民的利益更紧密地结合起来，把中国式现代化与世界各国的现代化建设更有机地对接起来，为续写经济快速发展和社会长期稳定两大奇迹新篇章作出外交领域的新贡献，为以中国式现代化全面推进强国建设、民族复兴伟业营造更有利外部环境。
第二，我们将为走出大国关系新路开辟更有效途径。大国是影响战争与和平的主要因素。世界必须找到一条新时期大国和平共进的新路。
中国锚定的是和平发展，在提升自身和平发展战略能力的过程中，致力于推动其他大国也走和平发展道路，携手构建和平共处、总体稳定、均衡发展的大国关系格局。我们将坚持按照相互尊重、和平共处、合作共赢三原则，打造中美两国积极互动新范式，在坚定维护国家主权、安全、发展利益基础上，推动中美关系实现健康、稳定、可持续发展。我们将巩固永久睦邻友好、全面战略协作、互利合作共赢的中俄关系，为中俄新时代全面战略协作伙伴关系不断增添新内涵，共同维护好大国关系和国际战略稳定。我们将弘扬中欧相互尊重、求同存异、开放合作、互利共赢的交往传统，打开中欧关系新空间，做坚守多边主义的真伙伴。
第三，我们将为构建周边命运共同体作出更积极努力。构建人类命运共同体是中国外交的崇高目标，是需要不懈努力、持续推进的历史进程。周边是推动构建人类命运共同体的关键。
我们将深入贯彻中央周边工作会议精神，秉持亲诚惠容、命运与共理念，携手各国共建和平家园，倡导共同安全意识，妥善管控矛盾分歧，让人民远离冲突和战争。共建安宁家园，积极斡旋热点问题降温回稳，培育彼此战略互信，消除矛盾滋生的土壤条件。共建繁荣家园，挖掘RCEP合作潜力，确保中国东盟自贸区3.0尽早实施，深化周边发展融合格局。共建美丽家园，加强生态文明交流，践行“绿水青山就是金山银山”理念，推动区域可持续发展。共建友好家园，扩大人文交流，推进民心相通，筑牢周边命运共同体的民意民心根基。
第四，我们将为全球南方共同迈向现代化汇聚更磅礴力量。现代化不等于西方化，中国与全球南方国家在现代化道路上相互支持、并肩前行，将共同绘就人类文明进步新的壮丽图景。
作为最大发展中国家，中国将坚定维护发展中国家整体利益，致力于全球南方联合自强。金砖国家是全球南方合作的重要平台。我们将支持金砖机制做大做强，推动金砖国家在多极化进程中提升代表性和话语权。2026年是中非建交70周年。我们将推进《支持非洲现代化合作倡议》，加快同非洲国家商签共同发展经济伙伴关系协定，推动对非洲“零关税”政策加快落地，书写中非命运与共的历史新篇。中东局势动荡牵动世界。我们将主办第二届中国—阿拉伯国家峰会，增强中阿团结互信，加快完成中国—海合会自由贸易协定谈判，朝着建设中阿命运共同体方向不断迈进。我们密切关注拉美地区形势变化，将坚定支持拉美国家捍卫自身主权和民族尊严，在自主选择的道路上加快发展振兴。
第五，我们将为全球开放合作注入更强劲动力。“十五五”规划是中国发展的新蓝图，也是中国与世界合作共赢的新愿景。中国将坚持高水平对外开放，持续向世界释放超大规模市场红利，引领全球开放合作潮流、对冲脱钩封闭逆流，同各国共克时艰、共享机遇。
我们将在高质量共建“一带一路”进程中，更好统筹重大标志性工程和“小而美”民生项目，妥善应对发展道路上出现的干扰和困难，建设好这一全球规模最大、范围最广的国际合作平台，走好这条中国与世界共赢之路。我们将坚定维护以世贸组织为核心的多边贸易体制，共同抵制保护主义和关税霸道霸凌，拓展同世界各国各地区的贸易和投资自由化便利化。作为2026年亚太经合组织东道主，我们将与各经济体加强沟通、密切协调，合力推进亚太共同体建设，激活并探索实现亚太自贸区的路径，让亚太地区继续走在世界开放合作的前列。
第六，我们将为改革完善全球治理作出更突出贡献。面对接踵而来的全球性挑战，国际体系和机制急需与时俱进、改革完善。习近平主席相继提出全球发展、全球安全、全球文明、全球治理四大倡议，倡导推进平等有序的世界多极化、普惠包容的经济全球化，为构建更加公正合理的全球治理体系提供了战略引领。
我们将同志同道合国家一道，践行真正的多边主义，继续做现行国际体系的维护者和建设者。我们将携手各方，增强联合国权威和地位，坚守联合国宪章宗旨和原则，支持联合国在关乎世界和平与发展的重大问题上发挥核心作用。我们将大力推动发展议题重回全球治理议程的中心，支持优先增加全球南方国家在各种治理机制中的权重。我们将积极弥补“治理赤字”、填补“治理盲区”、拓展“治理疆域”，本着开放包容精神同各方共商共建新的治理机制和平台。
第七，我们将为捍卫国家利益展现更坚定使命担当。身处百年变局，中国外交将勇于直面风高浪急甚至惊涛骇浪的考验。我们将坚持原则、坚守底线，坚定维护国家主权、安全、发展利益，坚决挫败一切分裂国家的行径。我们将以不畏强权的坚定意志，不断提升和完善反制裁、反干预、反“长臂管辖”能力，为有效维护国家和人民利益提供更有力机制保障。我们将毫不动摇践行外交为民宗旨，加快构建更加严密的海外安全保障体系，强化风险预警机制建设，加强同各国执法安全合作，让中国公民、法人在海外工作生活更安全、更踏实、更放心。
各位专家，各位朋友：
时代潮流浩浩荡荡，中华民族伟大复兴势不可挡。我们将更加紧密地团结在以习近平同志为核心的党中央周围，坚持习近平外交思想的科学指引，以更加积极主动的历史担当、更加富有活力的创造精神，为强国建设、民族复兴伟业和构建人类命运共同体事业作出新的贡献。
谢谢大家！

来源：外交部　发布：2025-11-24 15:44
当地时间2025年11月23日，国务院总理李强在约翰内斯堡会见南非副总统马沙蒂莱。

李强首先转达习近平主席对拉马福萨总统的亲切问候，表示数十年来，中国和南非亲如兄弟，友谊跨越山海，历久弥坚。在两国元首战略引领下，中南正携手推进新时代全方位战略合作伙伴关系，致力于造福两国人民。中方愿同南非一道继续努力，弘扬传统友谊，深化政治互信，坚定支持彼此核心利益和重大关切，拓展各领域合作，更好促进两国共同发展和中非团结合作。
李强指出，上个月，中共二十届四中全会审议通过了“十五五”规划建议，南非宣布“十点经济行动计划”。中方愿同南非加强发展战略对接，推动零关税举措在南非早日落地，发挥两国在资源禀赋、经济结构等方面互补优势，深化矿业、基础设施建设合作，打造汽车产业等合作新亮点，挖掘新能源、人工智能等新兴领域合作潜力，拓展卫星导航、联合实验室建设等科技创新合作。双方要加强减贫发展和乡村振兴经验交流，推进公共卫生、文化、教育、青年等领域合作，提升两国民众获得感。中国和南非共同发起《支持非洲现代化合作倡议》，推动国际社会加大对非洲关注和投入。中方愿同南非在金砖国家、二十国集团等平台加强协作，落实习近平主席提出的四大全球倡议，维护多边贸易体制，推动全球治理体系改革，捍卫广大发展中国家共同利益。
拉马福萨请李强转达对习近平主席的亲切问候和良好祝愿，表示习近平主席同我就建立两国新时代全方位战略合作伙伴关系达成重要共识，推动南中关系迈上历史新高度，为深化双边各领域合作注入强劲动力。南非坚定不移奉行一个中国政策，重申台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，将同中方继续在涉及彼此核心利益的问题上相互支持。感谢中方为南非经济社会发展提供的支持和帮助，愿同中方加强贸易、投资、矿业、工业、科技、能源基建、医疗卫生、减贫等领域合作，造福两国人民。南非愿为中国企业在南投资兴业提供安全、良好环境，并同广大非洲国家一道用好中方优惠政策，推动中非合作深入发展。南非高度赞赏习近平主席提出的四大全球倡议。中国支持南非主办二十国集团领导人峰会，为会议达成共识和成果发挥重要作用，南方表示衷心感谢，愿同中方密切在联合国、二十国集团等多边框架内的沟通协作，共同捍卫多边主义。（来源：新华网）

李强出席坦赞铁路激活项目开工仪式
来源：新华网　发布：2025-11-21 13:34
当地时间11月20日，国务院总理李强在卢萨卡同赞比亚总统希奇莱马、坦桑尼亚副总统恩钦比共同出席坦赞铁路激活项目开工仪式。

李强表示，去年9月，习近平主席同赞比亚总统希奇莱马、坦桑尼亚总统哈桑在北京，共同见证签署《坦赞铁路激活项目谅解备忘录》。一年多来，中坦赞有关部门和企业勠力同心、积极行动，推动项目取得重要进展，迎来了正式开工。坦赞铁路就像一条纽带，把中坦赞人民的心紧紧连在一起。坦赞铁路精神是凝结着心血与汗水的宝贵财富，需要我们倍加珍惜、共同守护。现在的中非合作，已经迈上了共逐现代化之梦的新征程。坦赞铁路是中非合作的标志性工程。中方愿同赞方、坦方一道努力，让这条满载着希望的铁路在新时代焕发出新光彩，为坦赞两国乃至整个非洲的发展注入更多动能。
李强指出，中国政府将会同坦赞两国政府，为铁路激活提供必要支持和保障。希望中坦赞三方坚持高质量、高标准推进施工建设，把项目打造成优质高效、安全可靠的精品工程，树立高质量共建“一带一路”的标杆。中方愿协助赞方、坦方推动坦赞铁路繁荣带建设，合力打造新的经济增长枢纽，同时在沿线合作实施医疗卫生、减贫惠农等更多“小而美”项目，更好促进民生改善。中方也愿同赞方、坦方以铁路激活为契机，推进铁路、公路、港口等基础设施“硬联通”，加强海关、商检、税务等领域“软联通”，不断提升贸易和投资便利化水平，促进中坦赞之间、中非之间的市场、产业融合对接，汇聚更大发展合力。展望未来，中非合作前景广阔。中方愿同赞比亚、坦桑尼亚等广大非洲国家一道努力，进一步弘扬坦赞铁路精神，落实好中非合作论坛北京峰会成果，推动新时代全天候中非命运共同体建设不断走深走实。
希奇莱马、恩钦比表示，坦赞铁路是三国老一辈领导人缔造的友谊丰碑，也是三国人民独立自强、团结互助的时代象征。重振坦赞铁路是三国命运与共、共创未来的象征，将成为中非人民传承友谊、携手振兴的生动实践。赞坦两国愿同中方通力协作，积极落实中非合作论坛北京峰会成果，将铁路激活项目打造成共同推进现代化建设的精品项目，促进区域互联互通，推动沿线国家产业升级、绿色转型和经济发展，服务人民福祉，谱写构建新时代全天候中非命运共同体的新华章。
活动期间，李强同坦桑尼亚副总统恩钦比进行了友好交流。

习近平发表题为《携手推进现代化，共筑命运共同体》的主旨讲话。
习近平首先代表中国政府和中国人民对出席峰会的外方嘉宾表示热烈欢迎。
习近平指出，在这收获的季节，很高兴同各位新老朋友相聚北京，共商新时代中非友好合作大计。中非友好穿越时空、跨越山海、薪火相传。中非合作论坛成立24年来特别是新时代以来，中国同非洲兄弟姐妹们本着真实亲诚理念，在世界百年变局中肩并肩、手拉手，坚定捍卫彼此正当权益；在经济全球化大潮中强筋骨、壮体魄，累累硕果惠及中非亿万百姓；在大灾大疫面前同甘苦、共拼搏，书写了一个个中非友好的感人故事；始终相互理解、彼此支持，树立了新型国际关系的典范。经过近70年辛勤耕耘，中非关系正处于历史最好时期。面向未来，中方提议将中国同所有非洲建交国的双边关系提升到战略关系层面，将中非关系整体定位提升至新时代全天候中非命运共同体。
习近平指出，实现现代化是世界各国不可剥夺的权利。中国正坚定不移以中国式现代化全面推进强国建设、民族复兴伟业。非洲也正朝着非盟《2063年议程》描绘的现代化目标稳步迈进。中非共逐现代化之梦，必将掀起全球南方的现代化热潮，谱写构建人类命运共同体的崭新篇章。
习近平提出，中非要携手推进“六个现代化”。
——要携手推进公正合理的现代化。推进国家现代化建设，既要遵循现代化一般规律，更要符合本国实际。中方愿同非方加强治国理政经验交流，支持各国探索适合本国国情的现代化道路，确保各国权利平等、机会平等。
——要携手推进开放共赢的现代化。互利合作是符合各国长远和根本利益的阳光大道。中方愿同非方深化工业、农业、基础设施、贸易投资等领域合作，树立高质量共建“一带一路”的标杆，共同打造落实全球发展倡议的样板。
——要携手推进人民至上的现代化。实现人的自由全面发展是现代化的最终目标。中方愿同非方积极开展人才培养、减贫、就业等领域合作，提升人民在现代化进程中的获得感、幸福感、安全感，共同推动现代化惠及全体人民。
——要携手推进多元包容的现代化。实现物质文明和精神文明协调发展是现代化的崇高追求。中方愿同非方密切人文交流，倡导不同文明相互尊重、包容共存，共同推动全球文明倡议结出更多硕果。
——要携手推进生态友好的现代化。绿色发展是新时代现代化的鲜明标识。中方愿帮助非方打造“绿色增长引擎”，缩小能源可及性差距，坚持共同但有区别的责任原则，共同推动全球绿色低碳转型。
——要携手推进和平安全的现代化。现代化离不开和平稳定的发展环境。中方愿帮助非洲提升自主维护和平稳定的能力，推动全球安全倡议率先在非洲落地，促进高质量发展和高水平安全良性互动，共同维护世界和平稳定。
习近平强调，中国和非洲占世界总人口的三分之一，没有中非的现代化，就没有世界的现代化。未来3年，中方愿同非方携手推进现代化十大伙伴行动，深化中非合作，引领全球南方现代化。
第一，文明互鉴伙伴行动。中方愿同非方打造治国理政经验交流平台，设立中非发展知识网络和25个中非研究中心，邀请1000名非洲政党人士来华交流。
第二，贸易繁荣伙伴行动。中方愿主动单方面扩大市场开放，决定给予包括33个非洲国家在内的所有同中国建交的最不发达国家100%税目产品零关税待遇，推动中国大市场成为非洲大机遇。扩大非洲农产品准入，深化电商等领域合作，实施“中非质量提升计划”。中方愿同非方商签共同发展经济伙伴关系框架协定，为中非贸易投资提供长期、稳定、可预期的制度保障。
第三，产业链合作伙伴行动。中方愿同非方打造产业合作增长圈，着力建设中非经贸深度合作先行区，启动“非洲中小企业赋能计划”。共建中非数字技术合作中心，建设20个数字示范项目。
第四，互联互通伙伴行动。中方愿在非洲实施30个基础设施联通项目，携手推进高质量共建“一带一路”，打造陆海联动、协同发展的中非互联互通网络。为非洲大陆自由贸易区建设提供帮助，深化物流和金融合作，助力非洲跨区域发展。
第五，发展合作伙伴行动。中方愿和非方共同发表在全球发展倡议框架内深化合作的联合声明，实施1000个“小而美”民生项目。注资中国－世界银行伙伴关系基金。支持举办2026年青奥会和2027年非洲杯，促进发展成果更好惠及中非人民。
第六，卫生健康伙伴行动。中方愿同非方成立中非医院联盟，共建联合医学中心。向非洲派遣2000名医疗队员，实施20个医疗卫生和抗疟项目，推动中国企业投资药品生产，继续对非洲遭遇的疫情提供力所能及的帮助。支持非洲疾控中心建设，提升非洲各国公共卫生能力。
第七，兴农惠民伙伴行动。中方将向非洲提供10亿元人民币紧急粮食援助，建设10万亩农业标准化示范区，派遣500名农业专家，建设中非农业科技创新联盟。实施500个公益项目。鼓励中非企业“双向奔赴”投资创业，为非洲创造不少于100万个就业岗位。
第八，人文交流伙伴行动。中方愿同非方深入推进“未来非洲职业教育”计划，共建工程技术学院，建设10个“鲁班工坊”。重点面向非洲妇女和青年，提供6万个研修名额。共同实施中非“文化丝路”计划和“广电视听创新合作计划”。将2026年确定为“中非人文交流年”。
第九，绿色发展伙伴行动。中方愿在非洲实施30个清洁能源项目，建设气象早期预警业务平台，开展防灾减灾救灾和生物多样性保护合作。设立中非和平利用核技术论坛，开展卫星遥感、月球和深空探测合作，助力非洲实现绿色发展。
第十，安全共筑伙伴行动。中方愿同非方建立落实全球安全倡议伙伴关系，为非方培训6000名军队人才和1000名警务执法人员，邀请500名青年军官访华。开展中非军队联演联训、联合巡航，实施“助力非洲摆脱雷患行动”，共同维护人员和项目安全。
为推动“十大伙伴行动”实施，中国政府愿为中非各领域务实合作提供强有力支持。
习近平最后强调，中国共产党二十届三中全会对进一步全面深化改革、推进中国式现代化作出系统部署。这将进一步深刻改变中国，也必将为非洲国家、为中非共逐现代化之梦提供新机遇、注入新动能。非洲有句谚语“同路人才是真朋友”。现代化道路上一个都不能少，一国都不能掉队。让我们凝聚起28亿多中非人民的磅礴力量，在现代化征程上携手同行，以中非现代化助力全球南方现代化，绘就人类发展史上崭新画卷，共同推动世界走向和平、安全、繁荣、进步的光明前景！
中非合作论坛共同主席国塞内加尔总统法耶，非盟轮值主席国毛里塔尼亚总统加兹瓦尼，非洲次区域代表南非总统拉马福萨、刚果（布）总统萨苏、尼日利亚总统提努布、坦桑尼亚总统哈桑，峰会特邀嘉宾、联合国秘书长古特雷斯，非盟委员会主席法基也在开幕式致辞。
非方领导人感谢中方主办此次中非合作论坛北京峰会，高度评价非中深厚传统友谊和中非合作论坛成立以来特别是2018年北京峰会以来取得的积极成果，高度赞赏习近平主席提出中非携手推进现代化“十大伙伴行动”。他们表示，中非合作论坛不仅是促进非中伙伴关系发展的有效平台，也已经成为引领南南合作的光辉典范。论坛合作基于友谊、尊重和互利共赢，中国对非合作不带任何政治附加条件，极大促进了非洲国家互联互通和经济社会发展。在当前复杂动荡国际形势下，深化对华合作更加成为非洲国家实现安全、稳定和可持续发展的希望。非中理念相近。非方高度赞赏并完全支持习近平主席提出的构建人类命运共同体重要理念和共建“一带一路”倡议、全球发展倡议、全球安全倡议、全球文明倡议，愿同中方共同倡导全人类共同价值，支持各国探索符合本国国情的现代化道路。非方坚定奉行一个中国政策，坚定支持中国政府为实现国家统一所作的一切努力，坚决反对外部势力借台湾、人权等问题干涉中国内政。非方祝贺中国共产党二十届三中全会成功召开，相信中国进一步全面深化改革、推进中国式现代化将为包括非洲国家在内的世界各国带来更多发展机遇。非方愿同中方继续秉持和平共处五项原则和中非友好合作精神，积极落实此次峰会成果，携手推进工业化和农业现代化，构建新时代全天候非中命运共同体，共同迈向和平、安全、繁荣、进步的光明前景。
峰会通过《关于共筑新时代全天候中非命运共同体的北京宣言》《中非合作论坛－北京行动计划（2025－2027）》。

（2024年9月5日 北京）
中华人民共和国主席 习近平
尊敬的法耶总统，
尊敬的非洲联盟轮值主席加兹瓦尼总统，
尊敬的各位国家元首、政府首脑、代表团团长，
尊敬的联合国秘书长古特雷斯先生，
尊敬的非洲联盟委员会主席法基先生，
各位朋友、各位嘉宾：
春华秋实，岁物丰成。在这收获的季节，很高兴同各位新老朋友相聚北京，共商新时代中非友好合作大计。首先，我代表中国政府和中国人民，对大家的到来表示热烈欢迎！
中非友好穿越时空、跨越山海、薪火相传。2000年中非合作论坛成立，在中非关系史上具有重要里程碑意义。24年来特别是新时代以来，中国同非洲兄弟姐妹们本着真实亲诚理念，携手前行。我们在世界百年变局中肩并肩、手拉手，坚定捍卫彼此正当权益；我们在经济全球化大潮中强筋骨、壮体魄，累累硕果惠及中非亿万百姓；我们在大灾大疫面前同甘苦、共拼搏，书写了一个个中非友好的感人故事；我们始终相互理解、彼此支持，树立了新型国际关系的典范。
经过近70年的辛勤耕耘，中非关系正处于历史最好时期。面向未来，我提议，将中国同所有非洲建交国的双边关系提升到战略关系层面，将中非关系整体定位提升至新时代全天候中非命运共同体！
各位朋友、各位嘉宾！
实现现代化是世界各国不可剥夺的权利。西方现代化进程曾给广大发展中国家带来了深重苦难。第二次世界大战结束后，以中国和非洲为代表的第三世界国家相继实现独立和发展，不断纠正现代化进程中的历史不公。中华人民共和国即将迎来75周年华诞，正坚定不移以中国式现代化全面推进强国建设、民族复兴伟业。非洲也正经历新的觉醒，朝着非盟《2063年议程》描绘的现代化目标稳步迈进。中非共逐现代化之梦，必将掀起“全球南方”现代化热潮，谱写构建人类命运共同体的崭新篇章。
—— 要携手推进公正合理的现代化。推进国家现代化建设，既要遵循现代化一般规律，更要符合本国实际。中方愿同非方加强治国理政经验交流，支持各国探索适合本国国情的现代化道路，确保各国权利平等、机会平等。

各位朋友、各位嘉宾！
今年7月，中国共产党二十届三中全会成功召开，对进一步全面深化改革、推进中国式现代化作出系统部署。这将进一步深刻改变中国，也必将为非洲国家、为中非共逐现代化之梦提供新机遇、注入新动能。
非洲有句谚语“同路人才是真朋友”。现代化道路上一个都不能少，一国都不能掉队。让我们凝聚起28亿多中非人民的磅礴力量，在现代化征程上携手同行，以中非现代化助力“全球南方”现代化，绘就人类发展史上崭新画卷，共同推动世界走向和平、安全、繁荣、进步的光明前景!
谢谢。

王毅出席2025年国际形势与中国外交研讨会并作主旨发言
来源：直通非洲　发布：2025-12-31
2025年12月30日，中共中央政治局委员、外交部长王毅在北京出席2025年国际形势与中国外交研讨会开幕式并作主旨发言。
王毅表示，2025年是世界反法西斯战争胜利80周年,也是联合国成立80周年。这一年，国际格局演变走向分水岭，单极霸权不得人心，多极世界扑面而来，进步还是倒退之争日趋激烈；经济全球化遭遇严重冲击，开放还是封闭之选迫在眉睫；全球局部战争和跨境冲突频发，和平还是战争之问扣动人心。
王毅说，面对历史演进新关口，我们在以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导下，高举构建人类命运共同体旗帜，以元首外交为战略引领，用最大诚意团结世界进步力量，尽最大努力汇聚和平发展能量，做世界和平乱局中的稳定锚、周边环境新局中的主心骨、国际秩序变局中的定盘星、全球发展困局中的主引擎、国际道义危局中的压舱石，为中华民族谋复兴，为动荡世界谋大同，不断开创中国特色大国外交新境界。
王毅强调，中国特色大国外交2025年的奋斗历程，让我们比以往任何时候都更加深切地感受到：中国与世界的关系正在朝着更加积极的方向发展，中国的国际影响力、创新引领力、道义感召力显著提升。今天的中国外交之所以从容自信、破浪前行，关键在于习近平主席领航掌舵，关键在于习近平外交思想科学指引，关键在于党中央集中统一领导，同时也在于广大人民群众的大力支持，在于中国的外交理念始终占据国际道义的制高点。
王毅表示，“十五五”时期是基本实现社会主义现代化夯实基础、全面发力的关键时期。中国与世界关系进入我们可以为人类发展进步作出更大贡献的新阶段。2026年作为“十五五”开局之年，中国特色大国外交要更有作为。我们将为国家发展民族振兴提供更坚实战略支撑，为走出大国关系新路开辟更有效途径，为构建周边命运共同体作出更积极努力，为全球南方共同迈向现代化汇聚更磅礴力量，为全球开放合作注入更强劲动力，为改革完善全球治理作出更突出贡献，为捍卫国家利益展现更坚定使命担当。
王毅强调，我们将更加紧密地团结在以习近平同志为核心的党中央周围，坚持习近平外交思想的科学指引，以更加积极主动的历史担当、更加富有活力的创造精神，为强国建设、民族复兴伟业和构建人类命运共同体事业作出新的贡献。

在历史演进重大关头开拓中国特色大国外交新境界
来源：直通非洲　发布：2025-12-31
——在2025年国际形势与中国外交研讨会上的主旨发言
王  毅
（2025年12月30日，北京）
各位专家，各位朋友：
大家好！很高兴岁末年初再次相聚，一道探讨国际形势，盘点中国外交。
2025年是世界反法西斯战争胜利80周年，也是联合国成立80周年。在这个厚重的历史性年份，世界再次来到何去何从的重要关口。
这一年，国际格局演变走向重要分水岭，单极霸权不得人心，多极世界扑面而来，百年变局下的新旧矛盾集中暴发，进步还是倒退之争日趋激烈。
这一年，经济全球化遭遇严重冲击，关税战破坏国际贸易规则，扰乱全球经济秩序，开放还是封闭之选迫在眉睫。
这一年，全球局部战争和跨境冲突频发，创下二战结束以来新高，地缘政治动荡持续蔓延，和平还是战争之问扣动人心。
面对历史演进新关口，我们在以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导下，高举构建人类命运共同体旗帜，以元首外交为战略引领，用最大诚意团结世界进步力量，尽最大努力汇聚和平发展能量，保和平、促合作、应变局、担道义，为中华民族谋复兴，为动荡世界谋大同，不断开创中国特色大国外交新境界。
面对世界和平乱局，中国是稳定锚。百年变局加速演进，国际关系动荡变革，大国发生冲突对抗的风险明显上升。
中国作为世界主要大国、联合国安理会常任理事国，始终以维护世界和平为己任，身体力行推动构建新型大国关系，劝和促谈致力热点问题降温，坚持以同球共济超越地缘博弈，为维护世界和平展现大国担当。
过去一年，中美关系历经起伏震荡，实现了总体动态稳定，这符合中美两国人民共同利益，符合国际社会共同期待；中俄关系更加坚如磐石，保持高水平稳健运行，两国领导人在历史性年份实现互访，凸显中俄相互信任、相互支撑的全面战略协作伙伴关系真谛；中欧总结建交50年合作经验，再次确认伙伴关系基本定位；全球南方10国正式加入“金砖伙伴圈”，20个成员的“金砖大家庭”不断兴旺，“大金砖合作”越发红火。
乌克兰危机延宕已接近4年。中方以习近平主席提出的“四个应该”为基本遵循，坚持不懈为和平创造条件，汇聚共识。作为乌克兰危机“和平之友”的倡导者之一，我们真诚欢迎一切有利于和平解决危机的努力，同其他各方一道为之积极奔走呼吁。现在，谈判的窗口已经打开，和平的曙光就在前面。尽管前进道路仍然崎岖坎坷，但中方愿继续发挥建设性作用，期待达成全面、持久、有约束力的和平协议，消除矛盾冲突的根源，实现欧洲长治久安。
面对周边环境新局，中国是主心骨。在变乱交织的世界中，亚洲成为举世公认的全球发展繁荣高地，我国同周边国家关系处于近代以来最好的时期。同时，周边格局和世界变局深度联动，维护周边繁荣稳定需要付出不懈努力。
在周边形势演变关键时刻，党中央召开新中国成立以来首次周边工作会议，明确周边在中华民族伟大复兴进程中的重要定位，提出建设和平、安宁、繁荣、美丽、友好“五大家园”的努力方向，确立构建周边命运共同体的总体目标，发出携手周边国家共创美好未来的战略信号，为我国同周边国家关系发展注入新的强劲动力。
习近平主席今年主场外交和重要出访着眼周边。东南亚之行以点带面，巩固同东盟国家睦邻友好，推进互利合作，迎接共同挑战。俄罗斯之行传承中俄友谊、捍卫历史正义，把两大邻国互信合作提升到新水平。中亚之行首提“中国—中亚精神”，签署永久睦邻友好合作条约，筑牢西北方向长期稳定根基。东北亚之行引领亚太务实合作，推动中韩关系改善发展。今年，我们还邀请印度、朝鲜领导人来华，中印关系呈现向好发展势头，中朝传统友谊得到巩固弘扬。习近平主席主持上海合作组织天津峰会取得圆满成功，制定上合组织未来10年发展战略，落地4个地区安全中心，创设6个合作平台，签署数十份各领域合作文件。我国同周边国家的交往正迈入加快构建命运共同体的新时期。
一年来的周边关系发展和周边环境演变再次证明，与中国为邻是好事、幸事。中国不在周边搞地缘争夺，而是致力于睦邻安邻富邻；不在周边搞势力范围，而是构建命运共同体；不在周边搞一言堂，而是践行大家的事一起商量着办。中国的周边，堪称睦邻友好的示范区。
面对国际秩序变局，中国是定盘星。联合国风雨兼程80年，国际体系变革按下快进键。面对时代发展大潮，有人极力踩刹车，有人试图开倒车，而中国的选择是面向未来，携手各方共建人类命运共同体，推动国际秩序朝着更加公正合理的方向发展。
构建人类命运共同体是习近平外交思想的核心理念，顺应时代发展进步潮流，符合中国人民和世界各国人民共同利益。今年胜利召开的中国共产党第二十届四中全会通过的“十五五”规划建议，以构建人类命运共同体为主线，部署未来五年的对外工作，展现出中国为人类谋进步、为世界谋大同的坚定信念和实际行动。
2025年，世界见证了全球治理变革的“中国时刻”。习近平主席郑重提出全球治理倡议，倡导主权平等、国际法治、多边主义、以人为本、行动导向五大理念，为推动构建更加公正合理的全球治理体系提出中国方案，为重振联合国的核心地位和主导作用注入中国动力。这一倡议的提出正当其时，切中当今世界迫切需求，得到150多个国家和国际组织迅速响应支持。中国隆重纪念中国人民抗日战争暨世界反法西斯战争胜利80周年，习近平主席发表重要讲话，弘扬伟大抗战精神，坚持正确二战史观，发出正义必胜、和平必胜、人民必胜的时代强音。习近平主席专门出席在北京举办的全球妇女峰会，强调要为加速妇女发展新进程凝聚更广泛共识、开辟更广阔道路。我国会同30多个国家共同创立国际调解院，成为首个专门以调解方式解决国际争端的政府间国际组织，呼应联合国宪章要求，为各国搭建起化解分歧的新平台。中国倡导成立世界人工智能合作组织，将致力于加强全球南方人工智能能力建设，弥合“智能鸿沟”，加快人工智能全球治理进程。
然而，就在这个世界各国人民汲取历史教训、共谋和平发展的特殊年份，当年发动侵华战争的日本，不仅不深刻反省自身犯下的种种罪行，其现职领导人竟然公开挑战中国领土主权、挑战二战历史结论、挑战战后国际秩序。对此，所有爱好和平的国家、所有不希望悲剧重演的人民都绝不答应。我们必须高度警惕日本军国主义沉渣泛起，必须坚决捍卫用鲜血换来的二战胜利成果，必须有效维护来之不易的和平稳定。
面对全球发展困局，中国是主引擎。全球经济增速放缓，单边主义、保护主义横行，国际经贸秩序遭受严重冲击，各国发展面临重大挑战。中国经济顶压前行、向新向优，以强大韧性和充沛活力为世界提供支撑，以更高水平对外开放包括单边开放与世界分享机遇，中国对世界经济增长贡献率继续保持在30%左右，高于七国集团总和，成为全球发展爬坡脱困的主要推进器。
过去一年，我们大力推进高质量共建“一带一路”，同南亚、拉美、中亚多个国家新签合作规划和行动计划，对共建“一带一路”国家非金融类直接投资同比增长20%以上。坦赞铁路激活续写中非友谊新丰碑，中吉乌铁路建设孕育区域联通新前景，中欧班列累计开行12万列，一条又一条双向奔赴的“黄金通道”加速延伸拓展。
过去一年，我们扛起促进全球发展重任，连续举办进博会、服贸会、消博会，海南自贸港正式启动全岛封关，同东盟全面完成并签署自贸区3.0升级版议定书，同非洲持续实施“十大伙伴行动”，同拉美国家建设“五大工程”，同阿拉伯国家构建“五大合作格局”，同太平洋岛国形成七大合作平台架构，成功举行首次东盟—中国—海合会峰会，同各方结成更紧密发展合作伙伴。
过去一年，我们克服外部环境干扰和挑战，向需要支持和帮助的国际伙伴伸出援手，对所有最不发达国家和非洲国家实施“零关税”，宣布在坚持发展中国家定位的同时，不在世贸组织谈判中寻求新的特殊和差别待遇，主动让利于全球南方国家，承担起中国的国际责任。
过去一年，我们广迎四方客，持续扩容免签“朋友圈”，迄今已对48国实施单方面免签、对55国实施过境免签，今年前三季度免签入境外国人超过2000万、同比增长50%以上，开创了中外人文交流新局面。中国同世界的交流交融不断加深，世界投向中国的目光更加理性友善。
面对国际道义危局，中国是压舱石。强权不是公理，赢者不能通吃；良知不会泯灭，公道自在人间。中国外交弘扬和平、发展、公平、正义、民主、自由的全人类共同价值，致力在国际上守正道、扬公道、行大道，坚定守护国际道义的底线。
为寻求更加持久的和平，我们践行客观公正、标本兼治的中国特色热点问题解决之道，坚持不干涉内政、不拱火浇油、不拉偏架、不谋私利，一秉诚意斡旋缅北、伊核、印巴、巴以等矛盾以及最近的柬泰冲突。我们的坚持和努力经得起历史检验。国际社会促成加沙停火的努力值得欢迎，但世界仍欠巴勒斯坦一个公道。巴勒斯坦问题不能再次被边缘化，巴勒斯坦人民争取民族合法权利的事业不能无果而终，“巴人所有、巴人治巴”的原则必须坚持，“两国方案”仍是全面、公正、持久解决巴勒斯坦问题的唯一正确选择。
为争取一个更平等的世界，我们在事关国际道义的大是大非问题上坚定站在历史正确一边，旗帜鲜明反对霸权主义和强权政治，向遭受不公的国家提供力所能及的道义和行动支持。关税战、贸易战损害各国正当权益，损害多边贸易体制。我们挺身而出，既是为了维护自身正当权益，更是为了捍卫国际公平正义。
各位专家，各位朋友：
中美关系是当今世界最重要的双边关系之一。中美两国的战略选择，影响世界历史的演进方向。一年来，我们坚持从自身与世界的整体和长远利益出发看待和处理对美关系，在重大原则问题上立场坚定、态度鲜明，在涉及中国核心利益的问题上针锋相对、寸步不让，同时同美方接触对话、寻求合作，推动美方理性客观看待中国，通过协商对话解决双方分歧。习近平主席同特朗普总统4次通话、多次通信，在韩国釜山会晤期间就事关中美关系以及世界和平与发展的重大问题深入沟通，引领中美关系巨轮穿越急流险滩、保持正确航向。
一年来中美关系发展的实践表明，能不能做到相互尊重、和平共处、合作共赢，是中美关系能否稳定发展、造福世界的关键所在。中美合则两利、斗则俱伤，居高临下行不通，言行不一不可取。中美必须在平等、尊重、互惠基础上寻找解决各自关切的办法，探索出两个大国的正确相处之道。
台湾问题是中国的内政，是中国核心利益中的核心。针对“台独”势力的不断挑衅以及美国大规模对台售武，我们当然要坚决反对、有力反制。今年是台湾回归祖国80周年，实现祖国完全统一，是在依法维护国家的主权和领土完整，是我们必须完成的历史使命。我们看到，越来越多的国家和中国站在一起，不仅重申坚持一个中国原则、承认台湾是中国的领土，还明确反对一切“台独”分裂行径，支持中国统一大业。任何企图阻挡这一历史大势的倒行逆施都必将以失败而告终。
中国特色大国外交2025年的奋斗历程，让我们比以往任何时候都更加深切地感受到：中国与世界的关系正在朝着更加积极的方向发展，中国的国际影响力、创新引领力、道义感召力显著提升。今天的中国外交之所以从容自信、破浪前行，关键在于习近平主席领航掌舵，关键在于习近平外交思想科学指引，关键在于党中央集中统一领导，同时也在于广大人民群众的大力支持，在于中国的外交理念始终占据国际道义的制高点。
各位专家，各位朋友：
“十五五”时期是基本实现社会主义现代化夯实基础、全面发力的关键时期，中国与世界关系进入我们可以为人类发展进步作出更大贡献的新阶段。2026年作为“十五五”开局之年，中国特色大国外交要更有作为。
第一，我们将为国家发展民族振兴提供更坚实战略支撑。“十五五”时期，我国发展将与世界百年变局进一步交织联动，国际形势深刻影响国内发展，中国发展深度牵动国际格局。
服务好“十五五”起步开局是明年外交工作重要使命。我们将增强历史主动，提高政治站位，紧密对标党和国家发展新目标，坚决完成元首外交新任务，以系统观念把握百年变局新动向，有力服务高质量发展，积极推进高水平对外开放，有效化解外部风险挑战，助力我国在激烈国际竞争中继续赢得战略主动。我们将把中国人民的利益与世界各国人民的利益更紧密地结合起来，把中国式现代化与世界各国的现代化建设更有机地对接起来，为续写经济快速发展和社会长期稳定两大奇迹新篇章作出外交领域的新贡献，为以中国式现代化全面推进强国建设、民族复兴伟业营造更有利外部环境。
第二，我们将为走出大国关系新路开辟更有效途径。大国是影响战争与和平的主要因素。世界必须找到一条新时期大国和平共进的新路。
中国锚定的是和平发展，在提升自身和平发展战略能力的过程中，致力于推动其他大国也走和平发展道路，携手构建和平共处、总体稳定、均衡发展的大国关系格局。我们将坚持按照相互尊重、和平共处、合作共赢三原则，打造中美两国积极互动新范式，在坚定维护国家主权、安全、发展利益基础上，推动中美关系实现健康、稳定、可持续发展。我们将巩固永久睦邻友好、全面战略协作、互利合作共赢的中俄关系，为中俄新时代全面战略协作伙伴关系不断增添新内涵，共同维护好大国关系和国际战略稳定。我们将弘扬中欧相互尊重、求同存异、开放合作、互利共赢的交往传统，打开中欧关系新空间，做坚守多边主义的真伙伴。
第三，我们将为构建周边命运共同体作出更积极努力。构建人类命运共同体是中国外交的崇高目标，是需要不懈努力、持续推进的历史进程。周边是推动构建人类命运共同体的关键。
我们将深入贯彻中央周边工作会议精神，秉持亲诚惠容、命运与共理念，携手各国共建和平家园，倡导共同安全意识，妥善管控矛盾分歧，让人民远离冲突和战争。共建安宁家园，积极斡旋热点问题降温回稳，培育彼此战略互信，消除矛盾滋生的土壤条件。共建繁荣家园，挖掘RCEP合作潜力，确保中国东盟自贸区3.0尽早实施，深化周边发展融合格局。共建美丽家园，加强生态文明交流，践行“绿水青山就是金山银山”理念，推动区域可持续发展。共建友好家园，扩大人文交流，推进民心相通，筑牢周边命运共同体的民意民心根基。
第四，我们将为全球南方共同迈向现代化汇聚更磅礴力量。现代化不等于西方化，中国与全球南方国家在现代化道路上相互支持、并肩前行，将共同绘就人类文明进步新的壮丽图景。
作为最大发展中国家，中国将坚定维护发展中国家整体利益，致力于全球南方联合自强。金砖国家是全球南方合作的重要平台。我们将支持金砖机制做大做强，推动金砖国家在多极化进程中提升代表性和话语权。2026年是中非建交70周年。我们将推进《支持非洲现代化合作倡议》，加快同非洲国家商签共同发展经济伙伴关系协定，推动对非洲“零关税”政策加快落地，书写中非命运与共的历史新篇。中东局势动荡牵动世界。我们将主办第二届中国—阿拉伯国家峰会，增强中阿团结互信，加快完成中国—海合会自由贸易协定谈判，朝着建设中阿命运共同体方向不断迈进。我们密切关注拉美地区形势变化，将坚定支持拉美国家捍卫自身主权和民族尊严，在自主选择的道路上加快发展振兴。
第五，我们将为全球开放合作注入更强劲动力。“十五五”规划是中国发展的新蓝图，也是中国与世界合作共赢的新愿景。中国将坚持高水平对外开放，持续向世界释放超大规模市场红利，引领全球开放合作潮流、对冲脱钩封闭逆流，同各国共克时艰、共享机遇。
我们将在高质量共建“一带一路”进程中，更好统筹重大标志性工程和“小而美”民生项目，妥善应对发展道路上出现的干扰和困难，建设好这一全球规模最大、范围最广的国际合作平台，走好这条中国与世界共赢之路。我们将坚定维护以世贸组织为核心的多边贸易体制，共同抵制保护主义和关税霸道霸凌，拓展同世界各国各地区的贸易和投资自由化便利化。作为2026年亚太经合组织东道主，我们将与各经济体加强沟通、密切协调，合力推进亚太共同体建设，激活并探索实现亚太自贸区的路径，让亚太地区继续走在世界开放合作的前列。
第六，我们将为改革完善全球治理作出更突出贡献。面对接踵而来的全球性挑战，国际体系和机制急需与时俱进、改革完善。习近平主席相继提出全球发展、全球安全、全球文明、全球治理四大倡议，倡导推进平等有序的世界多极化、普惠包容的经济全球化，为构建更加公正合理的全球治理体系提供了战略引领。
我们将同志同道合国家一道，践行真正的多边主义，继续做现行国际体系的维护者和建设者。我们将携手各方，增强联合国权威和地位，坚守联合国宪章宗旨和原则，支持联合国在关乎世界和平与发展的重大问题上发挥核心作用。我们将大力推动发展议题重回全球治理议程的中心，支持优先增加全球南方国家在各种治理机制中的权重。我们将积极弥补“治理赤字”、填补“治理盲区”、拓展“治理疆域”，本着开放包容精神同各方共商共建新的治理机制和平台。
第七，我们将为捍卫国家利益展现更坚定使命担当。身处百年变局，中国外交将勇于直面风高浪急甚至惊涛骇浪的考验。我们将坚持原则、坚守底线，坚定维护国家主权、安全、发展利益，坚决挫败一切分裂国家的行径。我们将以不畏强权的坚定意志，不断提升和完善反制裁、反干预、反“长臂管辖”能力，为有效维护国家和人民利益提供更有力机制保障。我们将毫不动摇践行外交为民宗旨，加快构建更加严密的海外安全保障体系，强化风险预警机制建设，加强同各国执法安全合作，让中国公民、法人在海外工作生活更安全、更踏实、更放心。
各位专家，各位朋友：
时代潮流浩浩荡荡，中华民族伟大复兴势不可挡。我们将更加紧密地团结在以习近平同志为核心的党中央周围，坚持习近平外交思想的科学指引，以更加积极主动的历史担当、更加富有活力的创造精神，为强国建设、民族复兴伟业和构建人类命运共同体事业作出新的贡献。
谢谢大家！

学思践悟习近平外交思想 砥砺奋进民族复兴新征程
来源：人民日报　发布：2025-12-18
新时代新征程，以习近平同志为核心的党中央深刻把握中国和世界发展大势，在对外工作上进行一系列重大理论和实践创新，领导我国对外工作取得历史性成就、发生历史性变革，习近平外交思想不断得到丰富和发展。不久前，《习近平外交思想学习纲要（2025年版）》出版发行，全面反映习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想在外交领域的原创性贡献和最新发展，为广大党员干部群众学习贯彻习近平外交思想提供了权威辅助读物。
习近平总书记指出，党的理论创新每前进一步，理论武装就要跟进一步。我们要及时跟进学习习近平外交思想最新发展，深刻把握其科学体系、精神实质、实践要求，持续用党的创新理论统一思想、指导行动。
一
习近平外交思想是不断发展的、开放的马克思主义理论，始终站在时代最前沿，回答世界新课题，为中国外交勇毅前行提供强大思想武器和科学行动指南。
（一）坚持理论创新，永葆时代先进性。
习近平总书记坚持运用历史唯物主义和辩证唯物主义，以追求真理的精神推进理论创新，以全新的视野深化对人类社会发展规律的认识，为马克思主义国际关系理论的发展作出了重大贡献。
理论创新的根本途径是“两个结合”。在坚持把马克思主义基本原理同新时代中国外交具体实际相结合的基础上，进一步将其同中华优秀传统文化相结合，书写了马克思主义中国化时代化的外交新篇。“第二个结合”赋予习近平外交思想鲜明的中国气派，传承中华文明的优秀品格：人类命运共同体理念彰显了“天下为公”的美好愿景，全球伙伴关系秉持了“和而不同”的包容精神，亲诚惠容的周边外交诠释了“亲仁善邻”的交往之道，“一带一路”倡议体现了“立己达人”的担当情怀。汲取着中华民族漫长奋斗积累的文化养分，中国特色大国外交具有了更宏阔历史纵深、更坚实文化根基。
理论创新的重大进展是科学体系日益完备。习近平总书记在2023年中央外事工作会议上精辟概括了中国特色大国外交的方针原则，确立了新时代中国外交追求的崇高目标，明确了构建人类命运共同体“四梁八柱”的科学体系。构建人类命运共同体，以建设持久和平、普遍安全、共同繁荣、开放包容、清洁美丽的世界为努力目标，以推动共商共建共享的全球治理为实现路径，以践行全人类共同价值为普遍遵循，以推动构建新型国际关系为基本支撑，以落实全球发展倡议、全球安全倡议、全球文明倡议、全球治理倡议为战略引领，以高质量共建“一带一路”为重要实践平台。2025年习近平总书记在首次中央周边工作会议上又提出建设和平、安宁、繁荣、美丽、友好“五大家园”共同愿景，明确了今后一个时期周边工作的目标任务和思路举措，为聚焦构建周边命运共同体指明方向。
理论创新的突出贡献是深刻回答时代课题。面对层出不穷的全球性挑战，习近平总书记开创性提出四大全球倡议，形成以共同发展促繁荣、以普遍安全保稳定、以文明互鉴增互信、以完善治理求大同的有机整体，为解决人类面临的共同问题提供了中国方案。针对单边霸凌行径和逆全球化思潮抬头，习近平总书记倡导推进平等有序的世界多极化、普惠包容的经济全球化，为变乱交织的世界注入宝贵的稳定性、充沛的正能量。
（二）服务民族复兴，发扬历史主动性。
理论新发展指导外交新实践，引领中国特色大国外交进入一个可以更有作为的新阶段，以更清晰的历史自觉服务强国建设、民族复兴伟业。
机制体制上，党中央对对外工作的集中统一领导全面加强。近年来，相继制定出台《中华人民共和国对外关系法》《中国共产党领导外事工作条例》，为新时代中国特色大国外交提供坚强法治保障。进一步理顺地方外事工作领导体制机制，稳步推进驻外机构体制机制改革。党中央总揽全局、协调各方的对外工作大协同格局不断巩固，顶层设计更加科学，制度体系不断完善，统筹两个大局更加有力，对外工作运行更加高效。
外交布局上，形成了范围广、质量高的全球伙伴关系网络。我们推动构建和平共处、总体稳定、均衡发展的大国关系格局，中美关系朝着相互尊重、和平共处、合作共赢方向发展，中俄战略协作更加成熟稳定坚韧，中欧全面战略伙伴关系稳步推进。我国同周边关系进入近代以来的最好时期，全球南方联合自强不断迈出新的步伐，汇聚起改革完善全球治理体系的时代强音，构建人类命运共同体成为国际社会共襄盛举的宏伟事业。
在习近平外交思想旗帜下，对外工作的战略自主性和历史主动性显著增强，我国已成为更具国际影响力、创新引领力、道义感召力的负责任大国，同世界的关系进入一个可以更多把握历史主动、更大程度影响世界发展方向的新时期。
（三）秉持胸怀天下，彰显道义引领性。
习近平外交思想心系人类前途命运，直面世界难题挑战，为人类进步事业贡献智慧，为完善全球治理指明方向。
纵观历史，人类社会呼唤新型的国际关系理论，既是民族的又是世界的，既肩负历史使命又顺应时代潮流。习近平外交思想就是中国共产党人给出的答案，主张以和平发展超越冲突对抗，以共同安全取代绝对安全，以互利共赢摒弃零和博弈，以交流互鉴防止文明冲突，以绿色发展呵护地球家园，以中国式现代化创造人类文明新形态，不走国强必霸、殖民掠夺的老路邪路，而是开辟中国特色大国外交的新路正路。这一系列重大理念和实践创新，超越了传统国际关系理论的窠臼，书写了人类政治文明的崭新篇章。
环顾世界，各国多元文明的合理内核彼此相通，在和合共生中相互照亮。习近平外交思想弘扬全人类共同价值，提炼人类发展进步积淀的共同理念，画出了不同国家民族价值追求的最大同心圆。“一带一路”大家庭已覆盖全球四分之三国家，四大全球倡议得到100多个国家和国际组织支持，84个国家加入“全球发展倡议之友小组”，就在近期，43个创始成员国又在联合国共同发起“全球治理之友小组”，越来越多的国家和地区组织愿意同中方携手建设命运共同体。国际政要和有识之士纷纷表示，习近平外交思想具有重大时代和世界意义，构建人类命运共同体理念为世界带来和平、发展和希望。
（四）深化规律认识，发挥实践指导性。
习近平外交思想坚持马克思主义立场观点方法，精辟概括“六个必须”的新经验新认识，提供了指导对外工作的科学方法。
必须做到坚持原则，就是在大是大非上旗帜鲜明，捍卫公平正义上仗义执言，坚定站在历史正确一边。必须体现大国担当，就是坚持独立自主传统，以胸怀天下的抱负，回应各国人民普遍关切，坚持引领世界的和平与发展。必须树立系统观念，就是秉持正确历史观、大局观，运用普遍联系、不断发展的观点和方法分析形势、制定政策。必须坚持守正创新，就是坚守中国外交的根本方向，与时俱进，不断探索新思路和新举措。必须发扬斗争精神，就是不畏强权霸道，树牢底线思维，原则问题上寸步不让，策略问题上灵活机动。必须发挥制度优势，就是坚持外交大权在党中央，加强统筹协调，确保各地区各部门形成强大合力。
“六个必须”经过实践反复验证，体现了我们党的政治优势、思想优势和制度优势，凝结着新时代外交守正创新、开拓进取的精神财富，是做好新征程对外工作的重要遵循。
二
伟大时代产生伟大思想，伟大思想指导伟大实践。紧跟习近平外交思想引领潮流的步伐，回顾新时代外交极不平凡的历程，我们越来越深刻体会到：
习近平总书记战略引领是根本保证。
新时代以来，外交工作之所以能够办成一系列大事要事，取得一系列重大突破，关键在于习近平总书记作为党中央的核心、全党的核心领航掌舵，在每个重要节点作出正确战略判断和决策部署；关键在于习近平外交思想科学指引，始终从人类发展大潮流和世界变化大格局中准确把握中国同世界关系。这是我们应对世界不确定性的最大确定性，是前进道路上战胜一切艰难险阻的最大底气。
坚持中国特色是信念之基。
坚定不移走中国特色社会主义道路，传承弘扬新中国外交优良传统，坚持社会主义政治方向，植根中华文明深厚积淀，中国特色大国外交之路就会越走越宽广，越走越坚实，就能为破解时代难题提供更多中国方案，作出更多中国贡献。坚持自信自立、开放包容、公道正义、合作共赢的方针原则，不断塑造中国外交独特风范，就能得道多助、行稳致远。
构建人类命运共同体是光辉旗帜。
站在人类何去何从的十字路口，习近平外交思想明确指出，构建人类命运共同体是新时代中国特色大国外交追求的崇高目标，也是世界各国人民前途所在。这一重大理念为变乱交织的世界廓清迷雾，推动国际关系实现从求同存异到同球共济的历史跨越，开辟了世界和平、安全、繁荣、进步的光明前景。
为中国式现代化营造有利外部环境是应尽使命。
我国发展进入基本实现社会主义现代化的关键时期，国际形势演变深刻影响国内发展，外部环境不确定难预料因素增多。对外工作要牢记初心使命，紧紧围绕经济建设这个中心，既为实现高质量发展提供更坚实战略支撑，又以中国新发展为世界提供新的合作机遇，在中国同世界的良性互动中实现合作共赢。
三
党的二十届四中全会擘画了“十五五”时期中国发展的宏伟蓝图，全党全国各族人民正在向着中国式现代化光明前景阔步前行。新征程上，我们要更加自觉地用习近平外交思想武装头脑，攻坚克难、砥砺奋进，交出无愧时代、不负人民的答卷。
进一步提高政治站位。
深入学习《纲要（2025年版）》是当前和今后一个时期的重要政治任务。要迅速掀起学习热潮，在全面学习、全面把握、全面落实上下功夫，准确把握习近平外交思想的精髓要义和科学方法，全面提高应对世界百年变局和处理繁重涉外事务的能力水平。深刻领会党和国家最高利益之所在，认真贯彻执行好党中央对外方针政策，淬炼更忠诚的政治品格、更昂扬的精神风貌、更过硬的政治素质，坚定走好践行“两个维护”的第一方阵。
进一步加强理论建设。
彰显习近平外交思想蕴含的中国之路、中国之理，以此回答国际社会的时代之题、世界之问，都离不开对习近平外交思想的体系化研究、学理化阐释。广大外交外事工作人员要坚持正确政治方向，站稳中国立场，善于运用习近平外交思想的观点方法，深入研究中国外交和国际关系中的重大问题，在学思践悟中坚持“两个结合”，扎根中国大地，赓续中华文脉，厚植理论根基，以更加严谨务实的科学态度，提炼阐释重要和标识性概念，逐步构建起具有国际影响的中国外交学知识体系。
进一步展现担当作为。
学习的目的全在于运用。要不断把学习成果转化为实干实效，坚持元首外交战略引领，围绕构建人类命运共同体这条主线，推动四大全球倡议走深走实，推进高质量共建“一带一路”，拓展平等开放包容的全球伙伴关系，构建更加公正合理的全球治理体系。始终坚持与时俱进，持续推动外交观念、体制、能力革新提升，增强对外工作的主动性、预见性、创造性。弘扬中国外交优良传统，推进外交队伍建设，打造对党忠诚、勇于担当、敢斗善斗、纪律严明的外交铁军。
进一步提升传播效能。
传播力决定影响力，话语权就是主动权。要以习近平总书记提出的重大理念倡议为核心资源，广泛传播习近平外交思想的时代价值和世界意义，弘扬这一重要思想的真理力量和道义担当，阐明中国特色大国外交的理论逻辑和实践逻辑。把宣介中国的主张同应对全球性挑战结合起来，构建起融通中外、耳目一新的叙事体系。贴近不同国家和群体，创新传播载体方式，发挥线上线下、官民学媒合力，讲好中国和中国人民的故事，讲好习近平外交思想与实践的故事。
思想指引方向，奋斗开创未来。我们要更加紧密地团结在以习近平同志为核心的党中央周围，以习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想特别是习近平外交思想为遵循，深刻领悟“两个确立”的决定性意义，增强“四个意识”、坚定“四个自信”、做到“两个维护”，担当作为、踔厉奋发，不断开创中国特色大国外交新局面，为以中国式现代化全面推进强国建设、民族复兴伟业作出新的更大贡献！(来源：《人民日报》)

李强在二十国集团领导人第二十次峰会上的讲话
来源：外交部　发布：2025-11-24
在二十国集团领导人第二十次峰会上的讲话
（2025年11月22－23日，约翰内斯堡）
中华人民共和国国务院总理　李强
尊敬的拉马福萨总统，
各位同事：
很高兴出席二十国集团约翰内斯堡峰会。感谢拉马福萨总统和南非政府的热情接待和周到安排。
本次峰会的主题是“团结、平等、可持续”，其中“团结”被置于首位，这让人不禁想起二十国集团一路走来的历程。1999年，亚洲金融危机暴露出全球经济治理协调不足，二十国集团机制应运而生。2008年，国际金融危机爆发后，机制升格为领导人峰会，带领世界经济走向复苏。不同地区、不同制度文化的成员携手同行，一次次攻坚克难，共促全球进步发展，其关键就在“团结”二字。
习近平主席在二十国集团领导人第十七次峰会上指出，团结就是力量，分裂没有出路。当前，世界经济再次面临巨大挑战，单边主义、保护主义甚嚣尘上，各种经贸限制和对立对抗增多。很多人在思考，到底是什么阻碍了国际社会的团结？综合各种分析，比较突出的有两点：一是各方利益诉求存在差异。对差异如果不进行积极调和，就会带来矛盾和纷争。二是全球合作机制存在不足。特别是公平公正且具权威性、执行力的协调机制相对缺失，难以在更大范围形成共识和合力。二十国集团应当正视存在的问题，探寻解决之道，推动各方重回团结协作的正轨。
面对世界经济复苏乏力，我们要坚持和衷共济。现在全球经济深度融合，没有一个国家能够独善其身，开放合作才能互利共赢。二十国集团应当坚定维护自由贸易，建设开放型世界经济。中方发布了“落实《二十国集团支持非洲和最不发达国家工业化倡议》中国行动”，支持减缓发展中国家债务，同南非共同提出《支持非洲现代化合作倡议》，还将设立全球发展学院，推动各国共同发展。
面对分歧矛盾，我们要坚持求同存异。各国在一些问题上有分歧是正常的，但这不应成为团结的障碍，更不能将其作为打压别国的借口。二十国集团应当积极寻找利益最大公约数，通过平等协商妥处纷争摩擦，推动解决各自合理关切。中方愿同各方加强战略沟通和宏观政策协调，巩固扩大共同利益基础。
面对治理困局，我们要坚持与时偕行。推进全球治理体系改革，重在顺应大势、守正创新。世界多极化是不可逆转的时代潮流。二十国集团应当带头坚持多边主义，加快推动世界银行、国际货币基金组织、世贸组织等机构改革，提升发展中国家话语权，构建更加公平开放的国际经贸秩序。
各位同事：
当前，气候变化、能源、粮食等多重挑战叠加，尤其需要国际社会以团结凝聚力量、靠协作破解难题。二十国集团应当发扬伙伴精神，展现更加积极的政治意愿，推动更为广泛的国际合作，共同应对挑战，合力推动发展。
第一，加强生态环保合作，提升发展韧性。气候和生态问题关系全人类的长远发展，这些年全球极端天气等事件频发，实现《巴黎协定》目标时间紧迫，任重道远。二十国集团应当秉持科学精神，坚持共同但有区别的责任原则，体现担当，抓紧行动。中国已宣布新一轮国家自主贡献目标，愿同各方加强“昆明－蒙特利尔全球生物多样性框架”内合作，推动《联合国气候变化框架公约》第三十次缔约方大会成果加快落地。
第二，加强绿色能源合作，推进公正转型。太阳能、风能等新能源天然具有普惠公平的特点。推动能源体系绿色转型，不仅将为人类发展提供强劲动能，也将更好保障各国平等发展权利。二十国集团应当推动全球绿色产业合作，保持产业链供应链稳定畅通，促进相关技术、产品的自由流通应用。中国已建成全球最大的可再生能源体系，同100多个国家和地区开展绿色能源合作，过去5年向世界提供的风电光伏产品累计为其他国家减少约41亿吨碳排放。中方愿继续以自身所能，为各国能源转型提供支持。
第三，加强粮食安全合作，保障稳定供应。现在全球仍有7亿多人面临饥饿威胁，必须采取切实行动为他们提供帮助。二十国集团应当推动优化全球粮食流通供给，构建大宗商品合作伙伴关系，建设开放、稳定、可持续的全球粮食市场，强化对粮食短缺国家的供应保障。同时，用好二十国集团农业部长会等平台，加强农业科技合作，提升粮食生产能力。中方愿同各国一起推动落实国际粮食安全合作倡议，为抗击饥饿与贫困作出新贡献。
各位同事：
近年来，新一轮科技革命和产业变革加速推进，为世界带来前所未有的发展机遇，但也可能形成新的不平等和发展鸿沟。人类文明的进步，不仅体现在经济、技术的发展及物质的丰富这些方面，更应体现在让所有成员公平获得发展机会、享有发展成果。新技术加快了世界发展变化的步伐，但我们不能坐视同行的伙伴被远远落下，更不能利用新技术设置发展壁垒。二十国集团要负起应有责任，推动各方坚持开放共赢、机遇共享，努力提升世界各国人民福祉。
一是推进人工智能的普及应用与有效治理。人工智能发展依赖全人类的共同智慧，开放普惠是必然要求。二十国集团应积极推进人工智能研发合作与成果共享，弥合智能鸿沟，完善治理规则。中国是人工智能技术主要的开源贡献国，欢迎更多国家加入世界人工智能合作组织、《开放科学国际合作行动计划》等，推动人工智能朝着有益、安全、公平方向健康有序发展。
二是促进关键矿产的互惠合作与和平利用。这对关键矿产的可持续供应、维护全球资源安全至关重要。二十国集团应支持“联合国秘书长能源转型关键矿产小组”发挥积极作用，落实《二十国集团关键矿产框架》，推动优化产业链供应链各环节利益分配，更好维护发展中国家利益，同时审慎对待军事等用途，防范安全风险。中国同有关方提出《绿色矿产国际经贸合作倡议》，欢迎各方积极参与。
三是强化对全球南方的发展赋能与民生支持。二十国集团应加大对非洲等发展中国家的能力建设帮助，特别是发挥科技赋能作用，创造更多就业岗位，促进妇女、青年群体发展。中方愿同各方一道落实曼德拉湾目标，让更多青年从经济全球化中获益。
中国人常说，众擎易举，独力难成。让我们团结一心、不懈努力，用实际行动为改革完善全球治理、共促经济发展发挥更大作用，共创繁荣美好的未来。
谢谢大家！

驻德班总领事出席南非和解日大会
来源：直通非洲　发布：2025-12-18 23:16
12月16日，南非政府在夸纳省举行和解日纪念大会，南非总统拉马福萨、体育文化部长麦肯齐、夸纳省省长恩图利分别讲话。多国驻南非使节出席活动。驻德班总领事李志工应邀出席，并与南非和各国嘉宾进行友好交流。
拉马福萨总统讲话时强调，南非是多元一体的国家，各族群不分肤色、语言和文化，都是南非民族共同体的成员，享有平等的权利和机会，不存在针对特定人种的歧视和暴力。我曾自豪地向中国领导人介绍，南非国歌是世界上唯一用四种民族语言演唱的国歌，这充分体现了南非的民族平等与包容和解。当前，某些外部势力无视南非民族和解与团结的事实，试图挑动南非的种族仇恨和对立，这是注定不会得逞的。
南非和解日是1995年设立的全国性公共假日，旨在引导社会勿忘南非黑人与白人殖民者之间血腥撕杀的历史创伤，推动不同族群之间的理解、包容与和解，促进国家团结与社会稳定。（来源：驻德班总领馆）

坦赞铁路焕新升级 汇聚中非发展合力
来源：撒哈拉视野　发布：2026-01-03 23:41
在坦桑尼亚达累斯萨拉姆中央车站，20世纪70年代修建的站房依然保持着旧有外观，站台旁停着老式柴油机车。不少机车已超过设计寿命，只能依靠拆旧件维持运行。如何让一条运行近半个世纪的铁路焕发更大活力？一场系统性行动正悄然展开。
在赞比亚中央省的新卡皮里姆波希车站轨道上，工人们用套筒扳手、撬棍等工具，将一颗颗钢轨扣件、道钉卸下，移开铁轨，工程师斯坦利·西穆希告诉记者：“我们正在给站内一段轨道更换新的枕木。”
今年11月，坦赞铁路激活项目进入全面施工阶段。不久后，这条承载着历史荣光的中非“友谊之路”将焕然一新，重新投入使用，续写合作共赢新篇章。

打造高质量共建标杆
坦赞铁路全长1860.5公里，东起坦桑尼亚港口城市达累斯萨拉姆，西至赞比亚的新卡皮里姆波希，由中国政府提供无息贷款援建。1976年7月，这条铁路正式移交给坦、赞两国政府运营。
坦赞铁路由三国老一辈领导人共同缔造，承载着深厚友谊和共同追求，被誉为“自由之路”和“友谊之路”。在当时极为艰苦的条件下，中国派出数万工程人员，数百名中、坦、赞建设者为此献出生命。对坦桑尼亚和赞比亚来说，它不仅是一条出海通道，更是国家独立和区域互助的象征。
运营49年来，坦赞铁路累计运送货物3000多万吨、运载旅客4000多万人次，成为保障坦赞两国及周边国家经济运行的“大动脉”。近些年来，即便在运力有限、班次减少的情况下，坦赞铁路仍发挥着服务民生的作用。它不仅是沿线民众的日常出行选择，聚集在一个个中小站点附近的食品小贩、搬运工、杂货摊、修理铺，构成了当地微型经济生态。

近年来，设备老化、管理机制滞后等原因限制了坦赞铁路货运能力，而区域经济发展与物流需求日益增长。在此背景下，坦赞铁路的现代化改造被提上议事日程。2024年，中、坦、赞三方启动了铁路系统性升级的前期调研，计划在轨道、信号、牵引供电、车辆等方面进行全链条提升，使坦赞铁路成为面向印度洋的长期稳定出海走廊。
2025年11月20日，国务院总理李强在赞比亚首都卢萨卡同赞比亚总统希奇莱马、坦桑尼亚副总统恩钦比共同出席坦赞铁路激活项目开工仪式，为这条老铁路的再出发按下“启动键”。李强指出，中方将同坦桑尼亚和赞比亚一道，把项目打造成优质高效、安全可靠的精品工程，树立高质量共建“一带一路”的标杆，并以此为契机推进铁路、公路、港口等基础设施“硬联通”，加强海关、商检、税务等领域“软联通”，不断提升贸易和投资便利化水平，促进中坦赞之间、中非之间的市场、产业融合对接。
在坦桑尼亚国家博物馆最近举办的一个关于坦赞铁路的活动上，记者见到曾参与铁路建设的退休工人、73岁的索罗蒙·姆瓦卡桑加。他直言铁路老化严重、速度偏低，已影响区域货运能力，许多货主不得不转向成本更高的公路运输。他对铁路激活项目寄予厚望：“铁路升级后，青年有工作、农民能卖货、企业敢投资。它不仅是一条铁路，更是未来。”

为发展注入新动能
非洲物流成本远高于世界平均水平，在基础设施领域存在大量投资缺口。坦赞铁路激活项目有助于非洲弥补基建赤字，提升整体运力，同时降低内陆国家矿产出海成本，助推非洲更紧密地融入全球经济。
随着激活项目的推进，坦赞铁路货运能力预计将提升至每年240万吨，货物运输时间或将缩短近三分之二。
不仅如此，根据三国联合声明，中、坦、赞将携手推动建设坦赞铁路繁荣带，释放区域发展潜力，助力坦、赞两国工业化和农业现代化，改善沿线百姓民生福祉。
安哥拉天主教大学教授威尔逊·内韦斯表示，随着非洲国家稳步推进区域一体化，“非洲希望在产业、技术、就业和能力建设方面加强与外界合作”。在他看来，在互惠互利的伙伴关系下，交通干线改造不仅关乎提升物流能力，更有望引领区域经济发展走上快车道。
北京大学非洲研究中心副秘书长王进杰指出，中非基础设施合作正从“重建设”向“重运营、重治理、重可持续”转型。从援建项目走向共同运营的经济走廊，既关乎坦赞铁路自身能否用得久，也关乎未来中非相关领域合作模式能否实现迭代升级。

在此次改造中，三方在坦赞铁路沿线规划布局物流枢纽、工业园区，叠加加工制造、农业冷链、仓储和各类生产性服务，以带动周边区域发展。同时，为保障铁路能实现商业化可持续运营，还配套设立培训中心、职教项目以及现代化的公司治理与监管框架。
达累斯萨拉姆大学中国研究中心主任汉弗莱·莫希接受记者采访时说，坦赞铁路现代化不是一般意义上的项目升级，而是在东非乃至整个非洲大陆格局加速演变背景下的一次战略性再定位。他表示，坦赞铁路历史久远、深得民心、沿线产业链较完整、与中国在东非的其他项目可形成联动，这条经济走廊前景广阔，未来有望成为东非制造业和贸易的主轴。
莫希说，坦桑尼亚希望重新成为区域枢纽，赞比亚希望降低物流成本、提高出口稳定性，中国希望与非洲汇聚更大发展合力，“三方目标高度一致，这就是坦赞铁路现代化的最大前景与底气所在”。（来源：撒哈拉视野）

非洲在变局中发出更响亮声音
来源：新华网　发布：2026-01-02 23:11
当前，以非洲国家为重要代表的全球南方卓然壮大，正从全球治理的被动参与者逐步变为重要推动者，深刻影响世界百年变局的进程与走向。
推动全球治理的“非洲时刻”
11月下旬，G20约翰内斯堡峰会聚焦推动全球南方国家尤其是非洲国家普遍关注的发展议程。美国政府未派代表出席此次峰会，还在会前对南非施压，反对未经美方同意“以二十国集团共识为前提发表任何峰会成果文件”。
与会各方并未屈从于美国的压力，而是以“压倒性共识”在开幕当天即宣布通过《二十国集团领导人约翰内斯堡峰会宣言》，强调通过多边合作应对全球挑战，并呼吁加强对发展中国家的支持，以推动包容性增长与可持续发展。
南非总统发言人文森特·马格韦尼亚在接受新华社记者采访时表示，此次峰会宣言的顺利通过表明各国正以实际行动加强协作、支持多边主义。
这是非洲首次主办二十国集团峰会，并在推动峰会取得积极成果方面发挥关键作用，将非洲的发展诉求、独特视角和本土解决方案推向全球治理的前台。这样的“非洲时刻”并非偶然，而是全球南方国家在百年变局加速演进背景下群体性崛起的结果，彰显了全球南方力量。
非洲是希望的热土。国际货币基金组织预测，2025年撒哈拉以南非洲经济增速将达4.1%，高于全球平均水平。非洲大陆自由贸易区建设正取得实质性进展，目前已有48个国家完成协定批准，关税减让和规则协调正在加速推进。联合国非洲经济委员会发布的《2025年非洲经济报告》预计，到2045年非洲内部出口将增长45%，跨境贸易额将增加2757亿美元。
坦桑尼亚达累斯萨拉姆大学中国研究中心主任汉弗莱·莫希说，包括非洲国家在内的全球南方国家，在国际体系中的政治自信和议程设置能力显著增强。在国际议程中，这些国家不再只是被动接受者，而正逐步成为理念的提出者和规则的共建者。
寻求突破困境的“非洲方案”
在国际政治经济格局深刻变化的当下，非洲国家面临着与发展息息相关的一系列严峻挑战。正如非洲联盟委员会主席优素福在第80届联合国大会上所言，持续冲突、国家间紧张关系、暴力极端主义抬头等对非洲发展构成阻碍，建设一个和平、团结、繁荣、自强的非洲任重道远。
这一年，非洲部分地区安全压力增大，武装冲突、恐怖主义、政治动荡等复杂矛盾交织。刚果（金）反政府武装“M23运动”年内不断发动攻势，该国东部局势急转直下；苏丹内战延宕不绝，3000多万人急需人道主义援助；多个西非国家经历政变、政变未遂或脆弱的政治过渡，马里、尼日尔和布基纳法索由军政府掌权，几内亚比绍军方宣布“全面掌控”国家权力，贝宁发生未遂政变。
尽管各国局势动荡的直接诱因不尽相同，但其背后普遍交织着西方殖民遗留问题、恐怖主义蔓延等难题。同时，在内部压力之外，美国加征关税等外部冲击和干预也加重部分非洲国家的困境。
发展是解决一切问题的总钥匙。没有发展，就没有和平安宁，也就没有应对全球共同挑战的基础。非洲国家普遍认识到，谋求战略自主、探索符合自身国情的发展道路、加快推进非洲大陆一体化进程，是有效解决当前治理困境的“非洲方案”。
在今年2月举行的非洲联盟峰会上，与会领导人聚焦纠正历史不公。各国期待通过推进区域一体化和非洲大陆自贸区建设，努力将庞大人口规模和统一市场优势转化为内生增长动力，希望从根本上缓解殖民统治遗留的结构性脆弱、治理失能和产业基础薄弱等问题，逐步走出治理困境。
12月16日，以“建设一个新的团结非洲”为主题的首届非洲峰会在加纳首都阿克拉开幕。加纳外长阿布拉夸在开幕式上表示，非洲推进一体化进程所处的全球环境正在发生快速而深刻的变化，非洲应发出统一声音，协同外交和经济立场，转变为积极塑造全球发展走向的重要力量。
振兴全球南方的“中坚力量”
12月15日，一批重约1吨的贝宁“甜面包”菠萝抵达湖南长沙机场，标志着这一贝宁特有品种水果正式进入中国市场。“零关税待遇大幅降低了我们的贸易成本。”贝宁“甜面包”菠萝中国进口商负责人王珏说，“我们计划将这批菠萝投放到省内外的连锁超市和水果店。目前市场反馈很好！”
长期以来，中国一直重视推动非洲优质特色农产品输华，并建立了相关“绿色通道”，缩短检验检疫时间，扩大关税豁免。今年6月，中方进一步宣布，愿通过商签共同发展经济伙伴关系协定，落实对53个非洲建交国实施100%税目产品零关税举措。
作为中国政府对外援助修建的第一条铁路，坦赞铁路是坦桑尼亚、赞比亚两国的交通大动脉。2025年，这条承载着中赞、中坦深厚友谊的“钢铁之路”迎来新一轮升级与振兴：坦赞铁路激活项目于11月正式启动。项目完成后，将联通南部和东部非洲铁路、公路与港口体系，推进区域基础设施“硬联通”。赞比亚交通与物流部长弗兰克·塔亚利指出，这条铁路将成为促进区域贸易、扩大就业和实现共同繁荣的重要引擎。
去年9月，中非合作论坛北京峰会成功召开，中国和非洲开启共筑新时代全天候命运共同体的新阶段。自那以来，中非双方锚定峰会共识，携手推进“六个现代化”，共同实施“十大伙伴行动”。现在的中非合作，已经迈上了共逐现代化之梦的新征程，成为振兴全球南方的“中坚力量”。
一年来，中国同肯尼亚、南苏丹等国签署“一带一路”合作规划，高质量共建“一带一路”蓝图不断铺展；推进莫桑比克纳卡拉旧港升级改造、续签亚吉铁路技术服务协议，助力非洲发展筑牢互联互通根基；移交中国首个文化旅游类援外项目坦桑尼亚恩戈罗恩戈罗-伦盖地质公园、启动聚焦中非媒体智库交流的“2026中非伙伴赋能行动计划”，中非人文交流内容愈加丰富……
数据显示，2025年1月至11月中非贸易额首次突破3000亿美元，中国连续16年保持非洲最大贸易伙伴地位，双边贸易结构愈加多元。肯尼亚非洲政策研究所所长卡关贾在接受新华社记者专访时表示，非中合作与伙伴关系经受住了时间的考验，为全球南方合作树立典范。
中国和非洲从来都是命运与共的好朋友、好伙伴、好兄弟。展望新的一年，中非将迎来开启外交关系70周年，2026年也是“中非人文交流年”。中非加强团结合作，共同维护发展中国家的正当权益，符合历史正义，符合时代潮流，也符合中非28亿人民的共同愿望。中非同心同向、携手共进，必将凝聚起磅礴力量，掀起全球南方现代化热潮，谱写构建人类命运共同体的崭新篇章。（来源：新华网）

2025：非洲大陆的中国印记
来源：撒哈拉视野　发布：2026-01-01 23:09
2025年，中非合作论坛步入成立25周年的历史性时刻。从共建“一带一路”的宏伟擘画，到真实亲诚理念的深入人心，从民相亲、心相通的深厚情谊，到共逐现代化的坚定步履，中非合作之路日益宽广。在广袤的非洲，记者深切感受到，合作赋能正让这片古老的大陆涌动出更大生机。
一株“幸福草”，点绿荒漠，温润人心。
今年是中国与毛里塔尼亚建交60周年。2025年6月，记者来到这个“沙漠之国”，记录中国菌草技术如何在此落地生根、造福一方。目之所及，菌草田郁郁葱葱。菌草既成为当地重要的饲草来源，也构筑起防风固沙的生态屏障。
这是1月18日在毛里塔尼亚伊迪尼村的中国援毛里塔尼亚畜牧业技术示范中心拍摄的菌草试验田一隅。新华社记者 司源摄
喜悦，真切写在人们脸上。牧民阿米尔·阿卜杜的羊群从瘦骨嶙峋变得膘肥体壮。“多亏中国专家，我们终于能喂养好牲畜，日子有了盼头！”
在毛里塔尼亚首都努瓦克肖特周边，一位常来探望菌草园的老人说，她自幼未见过沙漠之外的世界，这片意外生长的绿意，宛如梦中的园圃。
在“千丘之国”卢旺达，菌草技术正悄然改变成千上万家庭的生活。当地青年莱昂尼达斯自福建农林大学学成归国后，带领团队利用菌草培育蘑菇，供应市场。看到当地孩子们开心食用蘑菇营养餐，记者更深切体会到“幸福草”所承载的期待。
一座体育场，筑梦基石，照亮前程。
在肯尼亚首都内罗毕的塔兰塔体育城建设一线，记者看到，夜幕虽深，工地却灯火通明，成百上千建设者昼夜轮班，全力以赴。
这是3月18日在肯尼亚首都内罗毕拍摄的塔兰塔体育城项目施工现场。新华社记者 韩旭 摄
这座由中国企业承建、将作为2027年非洲杯主赛场之一的现代化体育综合体，自奠基之日便承载厚望。肯尼亚总统鲁托在视察开工现场时表示，这里将崛起一座世界级体育殿堂。
塔兰塔体育城建设故事系列短视频在社交平台发布后，网友留言：“中国始终以实际行动助力非洲建设”“感谢中国，期待更多合作佳音”。
塔兰塔体育城是中非合作的一帧缩影。2025年4月，鲁托在访华前夕接受新华社记者采访时说，蒙内铁路、拉穆港等重大基础设施合作项目不仅改善了肯尼亚国内的互联互通，也促进了东非地区的区域一体化和经济发展。
一场论坛会，心声共鸣，新程同启。
2025年11月，在南非约翰内斯堡，“全球南方”媒体智库高端论坛中非伙伴大会如期举行。会场内气氛热烈，媒体代表作为中非友谊的见证者与传递者，分享从东非辽阔草原到西非苍茫沙漠、从南部非洲繁荣社区至印度洋畔静谧村落的所见所闻所感。
11月13日，在南非约翰内斯堡，与会嘉宾代表出席“全球南方”媒体智库高端论坛中非伙伴大会开幕式。新华社记者 陈为 摄
在为期两天的会议中，来自中国和41个非洲国家的160余家主流媒体、智库、政府部门等机构和非盟的200余名代表围绕“全球治理变革中的中非担当”“全球南方振兴中的中非行动”和“全球文明共生中的中非交融”等议题展开深入交流。与会嘉宾纷纷表达对深化中非交流的热切期盼，称赞中国在团结“全球南方”推进现代化进程中的作用。
数据最有说服力。2024年，中非贸易额达2956亿美元，同比增长4.8%，连续第4年创历史新高。中国连续16年保持非洲第一大贸易伙伴国地位。同时，中国也是非洲最主要外资来源国之一。中方持续扩大对非开放，宣布对53个非洲建交国实施100%税目产品零关税……
回望2025年，这些被定格的瞬间表明，中非合作植根于共同的历史记忆，更指向携手奔赴的未来。展望前路，中国与非洲将继续携手，深耕厚植，为民生福祉，为和平繁荣。（来源：撒哈拉视野）

安哥拉社会各界就美对台军售问题表达对中国的支持
来源：直通非洲　发布：2026-01-01 00:10
12月29日，安哥拉社会各界就美对台军售问题公开表达对中国的支持。
安执政党人民解放运动外事书记奥古斯托表示，安人运与中国共产党传统友谊深厚，安人运始终恪守一个中国原则，在台湾问题上的立场是旗帜鲜明、一以贯之的，坚定认为世界上只有一个中国，中华人民共和国政府是代表全中国的唯一合法政府，台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。安方密切关注台海局势发展，坚定支持中方维护国家主权和领土完整，反对任何形式的“台独”，支持中国人民争取国家统一正义事业。
同日，安中友协发表声明强烈谴责美对台军售，表示这一行径严重违反《联合国宪章》和国际法，是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，损害中国的主权和领土完整，不利于区域和全球稳定；安中友协坚定支持一个中国原则，始终同中国政府和人民团结一致。《安哥拉日报》等媒体亦登载安方重申一个中国原则立场的表态。（来源：驻安哥拉使馆）

大使随笔：续写中马友好新篇章
来源：人民日报　发布：2025-12-30 00:55
今年是中国和马里建交65周年。中国和马里都拥有悠久历史和灿烂文化。近代以来，两国人民经过艰苦斗争，各自赢得民族独立和人民解放。1960年马里独立不久即同中国建立了外交关系，是撒哈拉以南非洲最早同中国建交的国家之一。2024年9月2日，习近平主席在北京人民大会堂会见来华出席中非合作论坛北京峰会的马里总统戈伊塔。两国元首宣布，将中马关系提升为战略伙伴关系，推动中马关系发展迈上新台阶。建交65年来，中马人民坚定支持彼此走独立自主的发展道路，高效开展经济社会领域合作，并肩促进全球南方团结发展，是真诚友好、患难与共的兄弟和伙伴。
中马政治互信历久弥坚。两国在涉及彼此核心利益和重大关切的问题上相互支持，共同维护多边主义和国际公平正义。马里政府长期恪守一个中国原则，为恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位作出重要贡献，坚定支持中方维护国家主权和领土完整的努力。中方以实际行动支持马方在主权、安全、发展方面的合理诉求，支持马里人民致力于国家统一、民族振兴的正义事业。
中马务实合作硕果累累。在马里独立初期，中国克服困难为马里援建了纺织厂、糖厂、皮革厂、制药厂等工业和民生项目，为马里经济发展和工业体系奠定良好基础。中国援建的巴马科国际会议中心、巴马科第三大桥、马里医院、卡巴拉大学城、3·26体育场等项目在马里经济社会发展中发挥着重要作用，是马里人民心中的明星工程。双边贸易稳步提升，2024年两国贸易额突破10亿美元，同比增长23%。中非合作论坛北京峰会提出的“十大伙伴行动”相关项目在马里有序展开，萨福光伏储能电站、“数字马里”等项目持续深化中马务实合作。中方开展的修缮小学、打井等民生项目遍及马里各地，赢得当地民众广泛赞誉。
中马民间友好薪火相传。自1968年以来，中国累计向马里派遣30批医疗队、医疗人员900多人次，为当地患者提供医疗服务超过700万人次，被马里民众誉为“东方白衣天使”。孔子学院和孔子课堂在马里掀起了学习中文、了解中国文化的热潮。中方通过提供政府奖学金、举办培训班等方式，为马里各界人士和青年创造赴华学习交流机会，为赓续两国传统友谊培养生力军。
千川江海阔，风好正扬帆。中非合作论坛北京峰会为中非关系发展指明了方向。不久前，中国共产党二十届四中全会成功召开，会议通过了“十五五”规划建议，擘画了中国式现代化的光明前景，必将为中非共逐现代化之梦注入新动能。中方愿同马方携手努力，落实两国元首达成的重要共识，进一步深化政治互信、充实务实合作、丰富人文交流，在构建新时代全天候中非命运共同体的进程中，续写中马友好新篇章。（来源：《人民日报》，作者为中国驻马里大使李响）

宝船作序 文化和鸣——中非文明对话续写时代新篇
来源：撒哈拉视野　发布：2025-12-30 00:55
在北京的中央礼品文物管理中心展厅内，一个“郑和宝船”模型十分引人注目。这件由塞舌尔前总统詹姆斯·米歇尔赠送的国礼，映照出一段源远流长的中非文明交流史。
600多年前，中国明代航海家郑和率船队七下西洋，足迹最远至非洲东岸和红海沿岸，谱写了中非文明乃至世界文明交流互鉴的壮丽篇章。如今，“郑和宝船”所承载的文明交流对话从历史走向现实。在平等、互鉴、对话、包容的文明观指引下，中非携手执笔，继续书写“文明因交流而多彩，文明因互鉴而丰富”的动人新篇。
源远流长　万里和鸣
阿兰·巴特勒-帕耶特曾担任塞舌尔总统府国务秘书，亲历了塞舌尔将宝船模型作为国礼赠予中方的全过程。在他看来，“郑和宝船”作为历史上海洋外交的象征，传递了和平、合作、理解的理念。
“中国倡导的‘和而不同’理念，道出文明包容共存的关键。中国拥有悠久历史和深厚文化底蕴，还以开放心态与世界分享，促进各国相互理解。”巴特勒-帕耶特说。
这是2024年5月14日在北京中央礼品文物管理中心展厅拍摄的塞舌尔前总统詹姆斯·米歇尔赠送的“郑和宝船”模型。新华社记者杨光摄
在与塞舌尔一海之隔的肯尼亚和坦桑尼亚，人们发现了更加久远的非中文明对话印记。据湖南省长沙铜官窑博物馆人员考据，这两个非洲国家沿海地区出土了中国唐代的长沙窑釉彩瓷片，比郑和下西洋的历史阶段还早数百年。
位于达累斯萨拉姆市的坦桑尼亚国家博物馆，展有多枚中国瓷片和多份航海史料图。博物馆历史分馆馆长肖马里·拉贾布·肖马里说，郑和船队来到非洲，不仅带来丝绸、瓷器和茶叶等商品，更促进了文化交流。“这一壮举对非中文明互鉴意义重大，印证了我们的紧密联系早已深植于数百年的历史中。”
“许多中国游客慕名而来，只为亲眼见证这些跨越数个世纪的历史信物。它们不仅是非中友谊的见证，更承载着两个文明对话的永恒记忆。”肖马里说。
600多年前，印度洋贸易航线上的“千年古港”——东非城邦基卢瓦基西瓦尼，迎来远道而来的中国船队，见证了满载黄金、香料与瓷器的商船云集的盛况。
如今，基卢瓦基西瓦尼岛已被列入联合国教科文组织《世界遗产名录》。与其隔海相望，由中企承建的“未来港”基卢瓦渔港正铺陈一幅现代化的繁荣景象。
古今交汇间，中非携手并肩书写友谊新篇章。
交流互鉴　携手前行
宝船至，礼仪行。“郑和宝船”记载的文明交流对话正从历史走向现实，将“协和万邦”“和而不同”等理念从古代海上丝绸之路延展至今。
回顾非中文明交流史，肖马里认为，非中交流在平等、相互尊重的基础上展开，与西方大航海开启的霸权史有根本区别。“郑和远航的目的绝非奴隶贸易，而是以商贸与外交为主。”
2017年，河南省文物局与肯尼亚国家博物馆启动中肯旧石器联合考古项目，以全球南方视角探索人类起源的奥秘。
2024年年底，《豫见东非 中肯考古——博戈利亚湖遗址石制品研究》一书出版，标志着中肯旧石器联合考古取得阶段性成果。肯尼亚国家博物馆馆长玛丽·吉昆古高度评价该项目的重要意义，认为这种技术与经验交流推动非洲史前遗产焕发新生，也让世界对人类起源有了更加多元的认识。
2023年11月3日，中肯联合考古队队员娄文台在位于肯尼亚巴林戈郡马里加特镇的临时驻地内对石器进行三维扫描。新华社记者王冠森摄
河南省文物考古研究院副研究馆员赵清坡认为，中肯联合考古成果推动全球人类起源研究范式的转变：即从“西方中心”向“多源多点”的共同探索模式发展。
2024年9月，中方在中非合作论坛北京峰会期间提出开展中非携手推进现代化十大伙伴行动，并将文明互鉴伙伴行动列为中非“十大伙伴行动”之首。
近年来，中国和肯尼亚学者联合编撰《肯尼亚植物志》，中非科研人员在航天等前沿领域携手攻关填补非洲国家多项成果空白，双方蓬勃开展的学术合作推动非洲在基础设施、新能源、电子信息等关键技术产业上取得突破……中非合作交流不断拓展新的领域。
2025年6月10日，世界各地举办丰富多彩的活动，庆祝首个联合国“文明对话国际日”。联合国内罗毕办事处总干事班古拉在纪念活动中呼吁响应首个国际日号召，强调对话是通往和平之路。
坦桑尼亚达累斯萨拉姆大学中国研究中心主任汉弗莱·莫希说，每种文化都有其独特价值，应该相互尊重、互学互鉴。中国提出的理念符合当今国际社会推动多元共存、包容发展的普遍共识。
文明同舟　共创未来
中非合作论坛北京峰会把2026年确定为“中非人文交流年”，将围绕“夯实全天候友谊　共逐现代化梦想”主题举办系列人文交流活动，促进中非人民心相通、情相融、力相聚，厚植中非友好民意基础。
近年来，中非学术合作蓬勃开展，智库交流日益深化，不断助推发展实践。
“当今世界格局已不同往昔，各国都在探索符合自身国情的现代化道路。我们应摒弃文明冲突论，支持文明包容互鉴与共同发展。”塞舌尔前社会发展和文化部部长贝尔纳·沙姆拉耶说。
2025年11月，“全球南方”媒体智库高端论坛中非伙伴大会全体会议在南非约翰内斯堡举行。乌干达发展观察中心执行主任阿拉维·塞曼达在发言中说，郑和率船队到访非洲时，其目的并非殖民或掠夺，而是开展贸易与友好交往。这一历史事实充分体现了非中关系始终建立在互惠与合作基础之上。
塞曼达说，在回顾历史的同时，更应着眼未来，寻找进一步加强文明互鉴与文化交流的机遇。他特别提到，即将到来的非中人文交流年将为双方深化数字、媒体与文化合作提供新契机。
在塞舌尔渔业和蓝色经济部部长让-弗朗索瓦·费拉里的办公室，一张郑和航海路线图摆在书架上。航海图上标注的“慢巴撒”“麻林地”等非洲东海岸古地名与《明史·郑和传》相互印证，勾勒出海上丝绸之路深厚而悠远的文化脉络。
这是2025年3月17日在塞舌尔首都维多利亚塞舌尔渔业和蓝色经济部部长让-弗朗索瓦·费拉里办公室拍摄的郑和航海图。新华社记者董江辉摄
“世界要变得更美好，文化和历史是最坚实的纽带。”费拉里说，中国拥有深厚的文明积淀，可以为世界提供宝贵的智慧与经验。“我们应善用各自的文明资源，促进全球团结。”（来源：撒哈拉视野）

金沙萨环线公路项目高边坡治理完成后的航拍图。　余 跃摄
刚果（金）首都金沙萨西南郊的工地上，摊铺机缓缓“吐出”滚烫的沥青，压路机紧随其后夯实路面，一条崭新的道路向前延伸。
近日，中企承建的刚果（金）首都金沙萨环线公路项目累计完成碎石底基层施工60公里，标志着这一重要民生工程建设进入全面加速阶段。这条新建的环线公路全长约72公里，设计双向四车道，建成后将极大缓解金沙萨交通拥堵，为当地居民出行带来便利。
“一揽子”合作，破解拥堵困境
金沙萨人口超过1700万。作为全市跨区交通的“主动脉”，穿城而过的N1国道仅为双向两车道，却承担了70%的城市交通压力。高峰时段，原本10分钟的车程经常要耗费1个多小时。当地一家物流公司负责人博西无奈地说：“从市中心到郊区仅22公里的路程，日常通行需要3个多小时，路上拥堵导致生鲜货物损耗率至少增加15%。”
2024年6月22日，在刚果（金）总统齐塞克迪和总理图卢卡共同见证下，金沙萨环线公路项目正式启动。项目分为西南环线与东南环线两段，串联起金沙萨市区与姆富蒂、卢当德里等周边数十个村镇，全线包含多座桥梁、涵洞及道路周边治理工程。该项目由华刚矿业股份有限公司出资，中刚基础设施建设股份有限公司负责组织实施，中铁八局等中资企业承建。
在金沙萨西南郊区的姆富蒂村，村民马贝莱说：“以前，从我们村去市区只有一条坑洼不平的土路，下雨时道路泥泞，出趟门很不方便。现在，这条土路因环线公路修建将升级为双向四车道的大路。”商贩盖特米·恩东巴也深有体会：“以前去批发市场进货，仅在路上就要耗掉大半天，生意很难做。现在部分路段修好了，生意也变好了。”
作为中刚“一揽子”合作框架下的重点基建项目，该项目主要通过技术转移和产业联动，提升当地发展能力。中刚基础设施建设股份有限公司董事长庞龙表示，环线公路建成后，将极大改善金沙萨交通拥堵状况，提升城市交通运行效率。
“环线公路建成后将彻底打破城市发展只依赖中心城区的格局。”刚果（金）国家大型工程局局长尼科·恩扎乌·恩扎乌表示，该项目是政府改善民生、促进经济发展的战略性工程，通车后预计能分流三成金沙萨的交通流量，有效缓解首都主城区交通拥堵状况，降低运输成本，提升金沙萨与周边省区互联互通水平。
因地制宜，打造品质工程
施工中，中方团队克服困难，因地制宜改进施工工艺，确保工程高质量推进，中企的专业水准和敬业精神赢得刚果（金）各界人士的一致好评。
中铁八局金沙萨项目部负责人张剑波表示，中方建设团队从一开始就树立目标——打造一条平整耐用、适配当地气候特性、真正经得起时间检验的高品质环线公路。施工期间，中方团队克服热带高温、雨季洪水等挑战，“从材料选择到施工工艺，中企全力以赴确保工程质量。”张剑波说。
为应对金沙萨常年高温的气候特点，中方团队研发出适应高温的沥青配方；针对当地粉沙土过于松软的特性，施工团队在易松动的边坡地带架起菱形骨架当“脊梁”，再铺设六棱块做“护甲板”，以“双保险”降低滑坡隐患。
在环线公路K12段的姆富蒂桥建设中，18根直径1.5米的桩基需要钻穿4种不同性质的岩层。“难度好比在千层酥里打桩。”中铁八局金沙萨项目总工程师谭桥说，既要面对细砂层极易溃散的特性，又要稳稳钻开坚硬岩层，团队采用的冲击钻成孔技术方案最终与复杂地质条件精准适配。中方还引入适配当地环境的80吨门式起重机及专用架桥机等中国装备，这些大型设备的应用开创了刚果（金）境内桥梁建设工艺的先河。
“项目充分展现了中国企业的技术实力和责任担当。”刚果（金）公共工程部官员卢多维克表示，“相信这些道路和桥梁会像金沙萨的棕榈树一样稳稳扎根。”
民生“痛点”，变成幸福“支点”
金沙萨环线公路项目的稳步推进，正在解决曾经困扰当地民众的出行难、就业难等生活“痛点”，为民生改善提供坚实“支点”。
项目施工中，中方建设团队在保证工程进度与质量的同时，认真履行社会责任，按照“中方技术+本地人力”模式，在施工过程中充分吸纳当地民众就业，开展技能培训，培养管道工、钢筋工、电工、焊工、机械维修工等当地技术人才，留下了“带不走的发展能力”。
中刚基础设施建设股份有限公司总经理何修义介绍，截至目前，该项目已累计带动当地3000余人就业，培养出10多个工种400余名技术人才。“是中国企业教给我们修路技能，给了我们在家门口就业的机会。”当地员工塞缪尔说，他已能熟练操作摊铺机。
目前，部分路段已投入使用，改善了当地居民的出行条件，有效节省了通勤时间。“新道路带来新生活。”在米腾迪镇新落成的建材市场里，店主露西告诉记者，她的瓷砖生意比去年增长了3倍，“过去客户总抱怨运输成本太高，现在批发商直接通过环线公路送货，我们的售价下降了15%。”
提起新路带来的变化，当地一所学校的学生玛利亚兴奋不已：“以前上学路上总会粘一脚泥，自从修了这条公路，我到学校时鞋子还干干净净。”该校校长比安弗尼·卢克巴说：“学校有约300名小学生和250名中学生，现有的7间教室根本不够用。中国企业正为我们建造10间新的教室。”
夕阳西下，金沙萨环线公路在暮色中向远处延伸，车灯与沿线村镇的灯火交相辉映。这条由中刚两国建设者共同筑就的道路，承载着金沙萨发展的新希望。（来源：《人民日报》）

刚果（金）正在同中国加强在职业培训领域合作——访刚果（金）国务部长利孔比奥
来源：新华网　发布：2025-12-27 00:21
12月22日，刚果（金）国务部长兼职业培训部长马克·埃基拉·利孔比奥在首都金沙萨接受新华社记者专访。新华社记者 史彧 摄
刚果（金）国务部长兼职业培训部长马克·埃基拉·利孔比奥日前在刚果（金）首都金沙萨接受新华社记者专访时表示，刚果（金）同中国的合作已从传统基础设施和项目建设，拓展至职业培训和青年就业领域，迈向更加注重技能培育与就业对接的新阶段。
利孔比奥日前出席了中国—刚果（金）职业技术教育培训大会。他在会前对新华社记者说，当前刚果（金）正加快推进矿业、基础设施和城市建设等一系列重点项目，对技术工人和专业技能人才的需求日益迫切。一项合格的培训、一种获得认可的技能，能够为青年打开就业之门。
利孔比奥近日走访了上加丹加省和卢阿拉巴省的多家中资企业，他发现这些企业大多设有条件完善、水平较高的培训中心。“其中一些培训中心原本面向企业内部员工，但我已与这些企业达成共识，从明年开始，一些培训项目将逐步面向刚果（金）社会。”
利孔比奥说，这意味着更多刚果（金）青年将有机会进入高水平的培训中心，接受优质师资的指导，并直接对接就业岗位。“我们的青年将因此真正从培训中获益，并获得工作机会。”
利孔比奥表示，刚果（金）与中国在职业培训领域的合作并非临时安排，而是建立在长期交流的基础上。早在2016年，他就曾赴华接受政策规划和宏观经济领域的培训，他对中国在发展规划和经济治理方面的经验有了更直观认识。
2024年，利孔比奥赴华出席世界职业技术教育发展大会，并实地考察中国职业教育体系与产业发展，就职业培训、技能对接和青年就业等议题与中方深入交流。他表示，这些交流为两国在职业培训领域开展务实合作奠定了基础，相关合作机制正从书面协议逐步转化为具体成果。
此次中国—刚果（金）职业技术教育培训大会上，中方专家围绕矿业、基础设施和应急医疗等领域开展培训，并在培训后协助学员对接招聘机会。
利孔比奥说，刚果（金）希望通过同中国深化合作，帮助更多青年掌握实用技能，在国家发展进程中实现稳定就业。他强调，这项合作是一个长期进程的重要开端。（来源：新华网）

塞中医疗合作推动塞卫生体系结构性转变——访塞内加尔健康与公共卫生部长易卜拉希马·西
来源：新华网　发布：2025-12-27 00:21
12月23日，在塞内加尔首都达喀尔，塞内加尔健康与公共卫生部长易卜拉希马·西在中国援塞内加尔医疗队50周年纪念图片展开幕式上致辞。新华社发（帕帕·登巴·盖耶摄）
塞内加尔健康与公共卫生部长易卜拉希马·西12月23日接受新华社记者专访时表示，塞中医疗合作已成为推动塞内加尔卫生体系整体提升的重要力量，在改善公共卫生条件、提升医疗服务能力和培养本土医务人员方面发挥了深远作用。
“中国医疗队长期扎根塞内加尔多地，尤其是在医疗资源相对匮乏的偏远地区，为当地民众提供了稳定、可及的医疗服务。”西在当天出席中国援塞内加尔医疗队50周年纪念图片展开幕式时对记者说，“这种合作不仅体现在看病治病层面，更体现在对卫生体系的长期建设上。”
他介绍说，中国援塞医疗队作为两国医疗合作的重要载体，最早从塞内加尔南部济金绍尔起步，逐步向其他地区拓展，在不同地区形成稳定服务网络。这种循序渐进推进合作的方式，使医疗援助与当地实际需求紧密结合，也为塞内加尔医疗资源的区域均衡布局提供了有力支持。
他还说，两国医疗合作在基础设施和能力建设方面成果丰硕。由中国政府援建的贾姆尼亚贾儿童医院，如今已成为塞内加尔全国儿科诊疗的重要中心，显著提升了当地儿童医疗服务水平。
“在此基础上，两国还将合作重点延伸至医疗人才培养领域，通过赴华培训与在塞本地开展医疗协作相结合的方式，持续提升医务人员专业能力。”西还特别提到，中国在现代医学与传统医学方面的经验为塞内加尔提供了有益借鉴，中医针灸等治疗方式正逐步融入塞内加尔医疗体系，有效丰富了本土医疗服务手段。
在他看来，塞中医疗合作的一个重要特点，是始终注重能力建设而非一次性援助。通过长期派驻医疗队、技术交流和人员培训，合作逐步转化为塞内加尔自身医疗体系能力的一部分，为当地公共卫生事业的可持续发展奠定了基础。
他说，塞中医疗合作秉持以人民健康为中心、兼顾现实需求与长远发展的务实理念，“这一合作持续推进、不断深化，推动了塞内加尔医疗体系实现结构性转变。”
西强调，塞中医疗合作实践表明，围绕民众实际需求持续推进合作，才能在改善医疗服务和公共卫生条件方面取得长效成果。“这正是双方合作最宝贵、也最值得延续的经验。”他期待与中方在医疗技术升级、专业人才培养等方面进一步加强合作，更好满足民众对健康服务的需求。
自1975年起，中国福建省开始向塞内加尔派遣援外医疗队。50年来，福建共向塞内加尔派出20批医疗队。（来源：新华网）

肯尼亚学者：中国的高质量发展对非洲具有重要启示
来源：新华网　发布：2025-12-25 23:39
肯尼亚主流媒体《星报》日前刊发肯尼亚智库南南对话执行主任斯蒂芬·恩代格瓦撰写的文章说，中国积极、战略性地推进经济转型升级，在数十年强劲增长的基础上，实施前瞻性的“高质量发展”模式，为全球伙伴与世界文明进步贡献了宝贵经验。文章摘要如下：
中国明确而系统地将具体经济战略与长远的国家愿景、科技抱负以及可衡量的社会福祉紧密结合，坚定致力于创新驱动发展、环境治理引领、产业现代化以及落实以人为本的发展理念。这为非洲发展中经济体提供了发展参照。
对于非洲政策制定者而言，中国从快速增长转向智慧增长的战略举措尤其具有启发意义。中国当前战略以系统性、由国家推动的科技创新投资为基石，通过持续的相关产业政策，中国已在多个新兴领域占据主导地位。
非洲从中获得的关键启示在于，培养类似的战略定力。通过对研究机构、先进技术、职业培训及数字基础设施进行有目的的长期投入，可以培育富有活力的生态系统，助力本土企业提升创新能力、增加附加值并融入全球价值链。
真正的发展必须坚持以人民为中心。中国的发展模式日益注重教育公平与质量、社会安全网的扩展、医疗服务的可及性以及缩小地区差距的针对性措施。这对非洲国家的启示十分明确：经济增长若不能切实、广泛地改善国民生活水平、安全保障与发展机会，终将是不可持续的。
中国近期的实践及相关重要思想为适应性治理提供了鲜活的研究案例，证明可持续、有韧性的进步来源于对创新的战略性投入、对环境与社会适应性的承诺，以及对改善民生的坚定关注。这正是高质量发展的核心所在，也为非洲塑造符合自身特点的美好未来提供了可供借鉴的重要启示。（来源：新华网）

非洲雄狮卡翁达逝世，他曾深刻影响了中国外交
来源：澎湃新闻　发布：2021-06-18 22:53
一棵参天大树倾倒了，一只非洲雄狮睡去了，一位中国人民的老朋友永久地走了。
他就是卡翁达。
很多中国年轻人可能不熟悉，但对一些上了年纪的中国人来说，这是一个曾经非常熟悉的名字，一位改变了南部非洲，也深刻地影响了中国外交和世界的人物。
6月17日，卡翁达走完了自己波澜壮阔的一生，在赞比亚首都卢萨卡的一家军队医院去世，享年97岁。
赞比亚政府随即宣布，全国进入21天的全国哀悼期，暂停一切娱乐活动并降半旗致哀。
因为没有卡翁达，就没有今天赞比亚。
是他领导人民推翻了英国的殖民统治，1964年，赞比亚宣布独立，曾蹲过英国殖民者监狱的卡翁达，出任赞比亚首任总统。
但他的影响力，绝不止于赞比亚。
非洲大陆是西方殖民最残酷、人民遭遇最悲惨的地方。赞比亚独立了，但南部非洲很多地区，仍生活在殖民者的残暴统治之下。
卡翁达坚决反对南非种族隔离，安哥拉、莫桑比克、津巴布韦、纳米比亚、南非等国游击队，在争取民族武装解放的过程中，都得到了卡翁达的积极支持。可以说，没有卡翁达，也就没有今天的非洲。
对不少中国人来说，卡翁达更是中非友好的一个象征。
新华社2019年的一篇文章就披露，今天我们习以为常的“全天候朋友”，其实是一个外来词汇，首创者就是卡翁达。
赞比亚是南部非洲第一个与中国建交的国家，作为开国总统的卡翁达，曾多次访华，尤其是1974年第二次访华时，他和毛泽东主席留下了一段影响历史的对话。
毛主席说：“我看美国、苏联是第一世界。中间派、日本、欧洲、澳大利亚、加拿大是第二世界。咱们是第三世界。”
卡翁达说：“我同意主席先生的分析。”毛主席又说：“美国、苏联原子弹多，也比较富。第二世界，欧洲、日本、澳大利亚、加拿大，原子弹没有那么多，也没有那么富。你看这个解释好不好？”
卡翁达说：“主席先生，您的分析很确切，十分准确。”
毛主席鼓励卡翁达：“研究一下吧。”
卡翁达回答：“我想不用研究，我们的意见可以取得一致，因为在我看来，这个分析已经很确切了。”
毛主席：“第三世界人口很多。”
卡翁达：“确实如此。”
毛主席最后说：“亚洲除了日本，都是第三世界，整个非洲都是第三世界，拉丁美洲也是第三世界。”
这是中国领导人第一次公开阐述“三个世界”的论断，这一论断对中国外交有着重大的影响，卡翁达则是第一位见证人。
而且，中国能有今天的国际地位，也与卡翁达等非洲朋友有着莫大的关系。
他曾在联合国讲坛上大声疾呼，联合国中没有新中国人民的代表，这是错误的。
1971年10月25日，第26届联合国大会，以压倒性多数通过2758号决议，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的一切合法权利。在23个提案国中，有一个就是卡翁达领导的赞比亚。
毛泽东主席曾感慨地说，“是非洲的黑人兄弟们，把我们抬进的联合国。”对非洲的老朋友，中国自然不会忘记。
卡翁达1967年第一次到访中国，周恩来总理亲自去机场迎接。看当时的老照片，人们走上街头，载歌载舞，高举着卡翁达的画像，欢迎他来到中国。
赞比亚是内陆国，独立后由于支持其他非洲国家独立运动，作为支柱经济的赞比亚铜出口通道被切断。为了打破封锁，新生的赞比亚和坦桑尼亚，迫切希望能修建一条跨国铁路，
为这条铁路，卡翁达和时任坦桑尼亚总统的尼雷尔，曾向美国、苏联、英国等国求助，但都遭到了拒绝。
他们最终向中国求助。
毛主席大手一挥，告诉尼雷尔：“你们有困难，我们也有困难，但是你们的困难和我们的不同，我们宁可自己不修铁路，也要帮你们修建这条铁路。”
这就是后来闻名世界的坦赞铁路。尼雷尔曾感动地说：“历史上外国人在非洲修建铁路，都是为掠夺非洲的财富。而中国人相反，是为了帮助我们发展民族经济。”
卡翁达也回忆说：“我和尼雷尔总统一同去西方国家，告诉他们赞比亚和坦桑尼亚需要这条铁路。然而，西方国家拒绝了我们，告诉我们不要期望有这样一条铁路。然后我们去北京见了毛泽东和周恩来。他们坚定地表示，‘我们和你们一同建这条铁路。’于是，中国兄弟姐妹们来了，我们一同拼搏。你看，这种友谊多么单纯。当其他人都认为不可能的时候，我们建成了这条铁路。还有什么能超过这种友谊呢？”
是啊，还有什么能超过这种友谊呢？
也正是这次访问中国回国后，卡翁达便创造性提出“全天候朋友”这个名词。从此，“全天候朋友”，被多次在不同场合用来形容中赞、中非关系。看新华社的报道，在卡翁达的家中，一直摆放着他与毛泽东主席会见时的合影。
新华社的一篇报道，还提到一个细节：
每有中国朋友到访赞比亚，只要身体条件允许，卡翁达都会热情接待。他会用标志性饰物白手帕抚摸每位到访朋友的额头，送上祝福，和中国朋友畅谈赞中友谊的历史和今天。
有时，他还会为大家弹起吉他或者钢琴，高唱由他填词的歌曲《团结一心》，共同祝愿两国关系不断发展。话别时，他会坚持送到门外，向每一位中国朋友挥舞白手帕，目送大家远去……作为赞比亚的国父，卡翁达尤其让人尊敬的是，1991年选举遭遇挫败后，他没有恋栈，而是毅然交出了权力。尽管他后来也遭遇过政治迫害，但一直坦然以对……
他离开了政治舞台中央，但却赢得了更多人的尊重。网络上还有不少短视频，年事已高的卡翁达，拄着拐杖，在人们的喝彩声中，跳起欢快的非洲舞蹈……
为表彰他杰出贡献，2003年，赞比亚总统姆瓦纳瓦萨举行隆重仪式，授予他最高荣誉勋章“赞比亚之鹰伟大统帅勋章”。2010年，卡翁达还被授予南部非洲发展共同体最高奖章“塞雷茨·卡马爵士”勋章。
2009年11月15日，卡翁达也因为他的杰出贡献，被中国非洲人民友好协会授予“感动中国的五位非洲人”之一。
现在，一个叱咤风云的人物，最终归于尘土。一个时代结束了，
时间，才是最残酷的敌人。但时间，也见证了什么才是患难之交，什么才是荣辱与共，什么才会万古长青。
为人民做出贡献的人，他的名字永垂不朽，他的功勋无人忘记。
唉，熟悉尼雷尔、熟悉卡翁达的人，也逐渐老了。
个人观点，不代表任何国家
为人民作出贡献的人
人民将永远怀念他
卡翁达先生
一路走好

南非总统呼吁青年群体为国家发展贡献力量
来源：中新网　发布：2021-06-16 22:57
中新网约翰内斯堡6月16日电 (记者 王曦)南非总统拉马福萨16日在2021年南非青年节庆祝活动上发表讲话。他呼吁南非年轻人挺身而出，为推动南非向前发展发挥应有的作用。
当日，拉马福萨在讲话中重点谈到南非青年群体就业。他说：“广大的青年男女，你们的国家需要你们。我们需要你们站起来，来证明属于南非青年人的美好生活其实触手可及。”此前，拉马福萨证实，南非政府的“总统就业计划”目前已经初见成效，后续还将推出更多促进青年人就业的措施，以加快南非经济复苏脚步。
今年南非青年节的主题为“为包容性和转型社会增加青年就业”。特别是在南非迎来第三波新冠肺炎疫情冲击的情况下，南非总统拉马福萨的此番讲话别具深意。就在6月15日晚间，他宣布南非因新冠肺炎疫情反弹重新上调针对疫情的“封锁令”等级。
截至目前，南非新冠肺炎确诊病例总数达到1761066例，死亡病例58087例。

南非提高疫情防控状态 中南两国航班熔断

原标题：南非提高疫情防控状态 中南两国航班熔断
近期南非第三波新冠疫情肆虐，南非总统拉马福萨当地时间6月15日晚通过南非国家电视台宣布该国从2级疫情防控状态提升到3级疫情防控状态。同时，因南非约翰内斯堡至中国深圳航班经检测确诊32名新冠病毒阳性个案，中南两国航班正式熔断。

南非总统拉马福萨表示：“新增感染人数激增意味着我们必须再次收紧对人员流动和集会的限制。我们需要更严格地执行疫情防控措施，对不遵守规定的人要采取更坚决的行动。因感染人数增加，我们决定将南非疫情防控等级提升至3级。”
受第三波疫情冲击，南非日增新冠肺炎确诊病例数在一个月时间里从2000多人直逼近万，在这种情况下，南非宣布宵禁时间提前至每日22时到次日凌晨4时，同时严控室内外聚会人数。

非洲累计新冠确诊超500万例 疫情形势不容乐观
来源：新华社　发布：2021-06-15 21:58
非洲疾病预防控制中心12日发布的数据显示，非洲累计新冠确诊病例已超过500万例，达5011502例，累计死亡134239例，累计治愈4504296例。
近来，非洲部分国家疫情严重反弹，一些地区疫苗接种推进缓慢，疫情形势不容乐观。

部分国家严重反弹
南非
是非洲新冠疫情最严重的国家，确诊病例数占非洲确诊病例总数三分之一以上。南非国家传染病研究所10日晚发布声明说，南非7日移动平均新增病例数达到5959例，于当天“技术性”进入第三波疫情。
自5月底以来，
赞比亚
新冠确诊病例数快速上升，单日新增病例数由此前的百例以内增至千例以上，10日和11日单日新增确诊病例均高于2000例；该国新冠重症和死亡病例数近来也大幅增加。赞比亚卫生部常务秘书肯尼迪·马拉马9日表示，该国新冠病例数激增主要由于民众未遵守防疫措施以及近期频繁举行的选举集会所致。
乌干达
总统穆塞韦尼6日就新冠疫情防控形势及下一步防控举措发表全国电视讲话时表示，该国第二波疫情中感染者的死亡和危重病例所占比例高于第一波时的情况；受第二波疫情影响最严重的群体年龄段是20岁至39岁，10岁至19岁年龄段的感染者也明显增多；医院的床位和氧气供应都出现严重短缺，医疗资源面临极大压力。
疫苗接种推进缓慢
据非洲疾病预防控制中心公布的数据显示，截至10日，已有50个非盟成员国获得约5490万剂新冠疫苗，其中已经接种3590万剂疫苗。从覆盖面来看，
非洲只有约0.6%的人口完成疫苗接种
。疫苗接种排名前五的非洲国家是摩洛哥、埃及、尼日利亚、埃塞俄比亚和南非。
世界卫生组织5月表示，
疫苗供应短缺、交付推迟令许多非洲国家在疫苗接种普及率方面落后。
据非盟数据显示，当前非洲的疫苗需求中99%需要进口。世卫组织非洲区域主任玛奇迪索·穆蒂日前呼吁有关国家能与非洲国家共享疫苗，帮助非洲填补缺口。
穆塞韦尼6日说，乌干达的疫苗接种工作受全球疫苗短缺影响，并因印度暂停对外供应疫苗出现更大缺口。他表示，政府正尽一切努力确保获得更多疫苗，以覆盖所有目标群体。
尼日利亚卫生部长奥萨吉·埃哈尼尔3日在新闻发布会上说，政府计划从任何愿意共享疫苗的国家引进疫苗。尼政府的目标是到2022年底让70%符合条件的尼日利亚人完成疫苗接种。
一些国家接种速度缓慢。南非人口约有5800万，政府计划在2021年底前为67%的人口接种疫苗。政府订购了超过5000万剂疫苗，但该国自2月启动疫苗接种以来仅有约161万人接种。据媒体报道，南非疫苗接种缓慢并非因为缺少疫苗，而是由于疫苗接种点少、接种点只在工作日开放和网上预约不利于老年人操作等因素。
地区经济遭到重创
在5月举行的联合国安理会关于非洲和平与安全议题的高级别会议上，联合国秘书长古特雷斯说
，新冠疫情让非洲约1.14亿人陷入极端贫困，并导致非洲大陆经济增长放缓。
此外，分裂言论、仇恨言论和错误信息带来新的社会矛盾，增加了地区冲突和不稳定因素。
非盟委员会主席法基曾表示，全球旅行禁令和国家封锁扰乱了非洲经济，导致许多非洲国家通货膨胀、民众失业和生活水平下降等。此外，疫情也对非洲中小企业和公立医院等造成了巨大打击。
疫情将继续对非洲经济和社会发展产生深远影响。

New Year Address to the Nation
December 31, 2025

The Kremlin, Moscow
New Year Address to the Nation.
President of Russia
Vladimir Putin
: Citizens of Russia, friends,
At this moment, as we stand on the threshold of the New Year, we all feel the passage of time.
Before us lies the future, and what it holds largely depends on us.
We draw strength from
within ourselves and from those who stand beside us – those who are dear and close to our hearts – and we are always ready to lend our shoulder in return. This
mutual support gives us confidence that all our aspirations, hopes, and plans
will definitely be realised.
Naturally, each of us has personal, unique dreams, very special in their own way. Yet they are
inseparable from the destiny of our Motherland and from the sincere desire to be
of service to it.
For we are united –
the people of Russia. The labour, achievements, and successes of each of us add
new chapters to its thousand-year history, while the strength of our unity
determines the sovereignty and security of our Fatherland, its development, and its future.
The New Year is,
above all, a time when we hope for the best, for goodness and good luck. It is
a special and magical holiday, when we open our hearts to love, friendship, and compassion, to sympathy and generosity.
We strive to bring
joy and warmth through our care for those in need of support and, of course, to stand by our heroes – the participants in the special military operation – in both word and deed.
You have taken upon
yourselves the duty of fighting for our native land, for truth and for justice.
On this New Year’s Eve, millions of people across Russia, I assure you, are
with you: they think of you, share your feelings, and place their hopes in you.
We are united by a sincere, selfless, and devoted love for Russia.
I wish all our
soldiers and commanders a happy New Year! We believe in you and in our victory.
Friends,
In just a few
moments, we will hear the chimes of the Kremlin clock, and the New Year will
begin. We welcome it together with the nearest and dearest: our children, parents,
friends, and comrades-in-arms. Even those who are far away – you are still with
us in spirit.
I wish you all good
health and happiness, understanding and prosperity. And, above all, love which inspires
us. May our traditions, faith, and memory bind all generations together,
supporting us always and in everything.
We are one – a great, strong, and united family, and that is why we will continue to work and to create, to achieve our goals, moving only forward for the benefit of our
children and grandchildren, for the benefit of our great Russia.
Happy New Year,
friends!
Happy 2026!

TITLE: Meeting on developments in the special military operation zone • President of Russia

Events
Meeting on developments in the special military operation zone
The Supreme Commander-in-Chief
chaired a meeting on the developments in the special military operation zone.
December 29, 2025
16:30
The Kremlin, Moscow
President of Russia Vladimir Putin:
Good afternoon, comrades,
Today, we will hold a regular
meeting on the developments in the special military operation zone. Our meeting
is taking place right before the New Year when we traditionally sum up the results.
During the expanded meeting of the Defence Ministry Board, the Defence Minister spoke in detail about the results
of the outgoing year 2025, and the Chief of the General Staff did the same.
Today, we will focus on the current
state of affairs along the line of contact, discuss the results of our work,
hear reports by commanders of groups of forces on the results of accomplishing
objectives by your military units and formations, and talk about short-term
plans.
As we always do at such meetings, I would like to ask the Chief of the General Staff to report on the overall
situation along the entire front line.
Mr Gerasimov, the floor is yours.
Chief of the General Staff
Valery Gerasimov
Gerasimov Valery
Chief of the General Staff of Russia’s Armed Forces – First Deputy Minister of Defence
:
Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
The Joint group troops are advancing
along almost the entire front. Military units and formations are defeating the enemy and advancing deeper into its defences.
In December, over 700 square
kilometres of the territory and 32 population centres were liberated, which is
the highest monthly advance tallied in the outgoing year. In all, 6,640 square
kilometres of territory and 334 population centres came under our control this
year.
The enemy is not undertaking any
active offensive actions. Its main efforts are focused on strengthening its defences,
and it is attempting to slow the pace of our advance by carrying out
counterattacks in certain sectors and through mass use of drones.
The North group of forces continues
to expand the safety zone in the border areas of the Sumy and Kharkov regions.
In December, following the liberation of Volchansk, control was established
over five localities in these regions. Simultaneously with the execution of combat missions, engineer units of the group are clearing the Sudzha,
Glushkovo, and Korenevo districts in the Kursk Region of mines. Units of the Korean People’s Army have provided significant help in this regard.
Formations of the West group of forces continue defeating enemy formations east of Kupyansk on the left bank of the Oskol River. The territory controlled by the encircled Ukrainian grouping
on the left bank has been reduced by more than half. Today, Boguslavka and Dibrova have been fully liberated. In the Krasny Liman and Rubtsy sectors, military
units and formations of the West group are actively advancing inside the city
of Krasny Liman. The destruction of enemy formations encircled in Drobyshevo
continues. The Russian troops control more than half of the localities.
After liberating Seversk, the troops
of the South group of forces are advancing along a wide front toward Slavyansk
and continue liberating Kostantinovka.
Having liberated Krasnoarmeysk and Dimitrov, the Centre group troops are advancing along a wide front. North of the Krasnoarmeysk-Dimitrov agglomeration, in Grishino, we have taken control of the entire southeastern part of the settlement.
At the same time, the group troops are
successfully creating a safety zone in the Dnepropetrovsk Region. About half of Novopavlovka has been liberated; street fighting continues in Novopodgorodnoye.
The East group of forces continues to advance in the Zaporozhye Region on the western bank of the Gaichur River, moving
deeper into the enemy defences.
The troops of the Dnieper group of forces are advancing towards the city of Zaporozhye. Lukyanovskoye has been
liberated; the liberation of Primorskoye is nearing completion, and street
fighting is underway in Orekhov.
Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
The execution of missions to liberate the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics, as well as the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions, will continue as planned.
This concludes my report.
Vladimir Putin:
Thank you, Mr Gerasimov.
Just the other day, the day before
yesterday, on December 27, we held a working meeting to review in detail the situation along the directions of operation of the Centre and East group of forces.
Following the liberation of Krasnoarmeysk and Dimitrov, the Centre group of forces is completing the elimination of the Ukrainian Armed Forces group encircled there and is, at the same time, conducting an offensive towards the state border, the border of the Donetsk People’s Republic.
The situation is also developing
favourably in the combat zone of the East group of forces in the Zaporozhye
Region. After crossing the Gaichur River, this group breached the enemy defences
and is advancing at a good pace towards Zaporozhye.
In December, the group liberated over
200 square kilometres of territory and ten population centres, including the city
of Gulyaipole.
Let us now discuss other directions
and discuss the situation in those sectors. We will begin with the north and then move south.
I give the floor to Colonel General
Yevgeny Nikiforov. Please.
Colonel General Yevgeny Nikiforov:
Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
After the liberation of the Kursk
Region, the North group of forces focused heavily on expanding the safety zone
on Ukrainian territory along the borders of the Belgorod and Kursk regions.
In the course of offensive
operations, military units and formations of the group took control of over 940
square kilometres of border areas in the Sumy and Kharkov regions and liberated
32 population centres. In the Sumy Region, 18 population centres were
liberated, including two in December. In the Kharkov Region, during combat
operations in December, five population centres were taken under control. In total, since the beginning of the Russian offensive, 14 population centres have
been liberated. The largest of them is the district centre, the city of Volchansk.
Vladimir Putin:
What is the total length of the line of operations to create these safety
zones?
Yevgeny Nikiforov:
In the Sumy Region, the safety zone is more than 16 kilometres in depth
and 60 kilometres along the front. At the same time, the forward units are less
than 20 kilometres away from the regional centre. In the Kharkov Region, the safety
zone extends up to 15 kilometres in depth and more than 130 kilometres along
the front line.
Vladimir Putin:
You mentioned the capture of Volchansk. When did that happen?
Yevgeny Nikiforov:
We took it in November.
Vladimir Putin:
How do you assess the significance of taking this city?
Yevgeny Nikiforov:
The liberation of Volchansk significantly expanded the length of the safety
zone and ensured the advance of the group southwards.
Vladimir Putin:
Good. Mr Nikiforov, this is a very important task, as it ensures the security of Russia’s border regions. In 2026, this work certainly needs to be
continued. I would like to thank you for the results, you and all personnel.
Mr Kuzovlev, the West group of forces is
operating effectively, and the Chief of the General Staff reports regularly. We
also met recently, and you briefed me on the situation in your sector. I would
ask you today to provide a detailed report on the results of combat missions in this area.
Please, proceed.
Colonel General Sergei Kuzovlev
: Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
In the Krasny Liman sector, combat missions are
being carried the 25
th
Army forces. Currently, units of the 67
th
Motor Rifle Division have entered Krasny Liman from several directions
and are engaged in combat operations in the neighbourhoods. They are advancing
westward, systematically clearing pockets of resistance in the enemy’s
strongholds. The 164
th
and 169
th
motor rifle brigades and the 11
th
Tank Brigade have secured the main road axis of Krasny
Liman – Zakotnoye – Seversk, thereby cutting off the enemy group’s primary
supply routes.
During the combat operations, the community of Dibrova has been liberated. Part of the forces has advanced to the northern
outskirts of Ilyichevka settlement and is currently engaged in street battles
to liberate it from the enemy.
Simultaneously, assault units of the 25
th
Army are developing their offensive westward, currently advancing through the forested areas of the Holy Mountains National Park, thereby expanding the zone
of control along the Seversky Donets River.
Vladimir Putin
: I would like to highlight the successful
operations on the Krasny Liman axis; they are important. Of course, the liquidation of this group in the north must be completed – we discussed this as well, and I recall precisely, on the left bank. How many enemy forces remain
there, according to our estimates?
Sergei Kuzovlev
: In the Boguslavka axis, we are completing the destruction of enemy forces in the 6
th
Army’s sector, and approximately 10 battalions remain in the 1
st
Army’s sector. That is
slightly over 2,500 combatants.
Vladimir Putin
: The numbers are gradually dwindling;
recently, you reported 3,500, correct? You reported that. You have also just noted
that the enemy’s attempts to hinder our operations inside Kupyansk must,
naturally, be resolutely thwarted.
I know that you are taking the necessary
measures.
Sergei Kuzovlev
: Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief, on the Kupyansk axis, the liquidation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces formations
encircled east of Kupyansk is being conducted in accordance with the plan
approved by the General Staff. Currently, our forces are destroying units of the 14
th
Mechanised Brigade in the area of the communities of Podoly
and Kupyansk-Uzlovoy. The operation is in its final stages.
We plan to completely block part of the enemy
group in January-February.
Vladimir Putin
: Good. Thank you very much.
I also extend my best wishes and gratitude to the personnel of the group.
Mr Medvedev, the South group of forces
is operating confidently and effectively. How is the situation progressing in your area?
Lieutenant General Sergei Medvedev:
Comrade Commander Supreme-in-Chief,
After liberating Seversk, the 3
rd
Army continues to carry out its missions in the western direction, with the primary focus towards Slavyansk, without slowing the pace of advance.
At present, the envelopment of Svyato-Pokrovskoye from the north and south has been secured and completed. On the northern flank, units have reached Zakotovo; on the southern flank, they
have reached the eastern outskirts of Bondarnoye. Combat missions in the direction of Seversk are ongoing.
Vladimir Putin
: What is the current situation in Konstantinovka?
Sergei Medvedev
: Comrade Supreme
Commander-in-Chief, in Konstantinovka, units of the 3
rd
Army Corps continue
to mop up the northeastern outskirts of the city. The Stroysteklo plant has
been taken under control, and operations to liberate the Konstantinovka Metal
Works are ongoing.
Vladmir Putin:
Approximately, what percentage of the city is currently under our control?
Sergei Medvedev
: Up to 45 percent, Comrade Supreme
Commander-in-Chief. If we take the northeastern outskirts, then about 40
percent.
Vladmir Putin:
We fully understand that the liberation of Seversk and the effective operations in Konstantinovka are
creating conditions for further offensive actions and for taking control of the entire Slavyansk–Druzhkovka–Kramatorsk agglomeration, as well as the enemy’s
defensive line as a whole. In coordination with the West and Centre groups of forces, this opens the way to complete liberation of Donbass. This is a strategically critical area, and your pace of advance is excellent.
I have already had the opportunity
to speak with your subordinates. Please, once again convey my gratitude and best wishes to them for their successful performance.
Sergey Medvedev:
Yes, sir.
Vladimir Putin:
Mr Teplinsky, your group is
positioned directly opposite a fortified area the enemy created many years ago.
Nevertheless, you continue to carry out active operations in this direction.
How do you assess the overall
situation?
Colonel General Mikhail Teplinsky:
Comrade
Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
The Dnepr group of forces,
overcoming the enemy’s prepared defensive lines, is advancing toward the city
of Zaporozhye. Stepnogorsk, which served as the enemy’s main defensive
stronghold on the way to the regional centre, has come under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. The liberation of Lukyanovskoye has been completed today.
The operation to take Primorskoye is nearing completion.
Combat operations are currently
underway in the city of Orekhov, in Novoandreyevka, Novoyakovlevka, Belogorye,
and Pavlovka settlements.
Over the past two months, the group
has liberated five localities. At present, units of the group continue
offensive operations in the Zaporozhye Region. Forward units are about 15 kilometres
away from the southern outskirts of Zaporozhye. This concludes my report.
Vladimir Putin
: Fifteen kilometres?
Mikhail Teplinsky:
Yes, approximately 15 kilometres to the outskirts.
Vladimir Putin
: Mr Teplinsky, I would also like to note your soldiers and commanders’ effective and successful actions. Please,
convey my best wishes to them.
Mikhail Teplinsky:
Yes, sir.
Vladimir Putin
: We are fully aware that the enemy
forces positioned opposite you have been preparing their defences in this area
for many years, and we know how difficult the conditions are. Nevertheless, you
are successfully accomplishing the tasks assigned to the group. In the short
term, it will be necessary to continue the offensive in coordination with the East group in order to liberate Zaporozhye. Thank you very much.
Mikhail Teplinsky:
Yes, sir.
Vladimir Putin
: Mr Belousov, would you like to add anything?
Defence Minister
Andrei Belousov
Belousov Andrei
Defence Minister of the Russian Federation
: Yes. Everything is proceeding
according to plan and at a fast pace.
In fact, as reported by Mr Gerasimov, progress
is ahead of the initially projected schedule. In December, we have achieved the highest operational tempo of the entire year.
Vladimir Putin
: Thank you.
Comrades,
The liberation of Donbass, the Zaporozhye
Region, and the Kherson Region is being carried out in stages, in accordance
with the plan for the special military operation. Our groups of forces are
advancing confidently, breaching the enemy defences. Units of the Ukrainian
Armed Forces are retreating along the entire line of contact.
The commanders of the groups reported on the current situation, and I ask you to continue to carry out the tasks of the special
military operation strictly in line with the concepts and plans of the General
Staff.
I would once again like to express my gratitude
to all Russian servicemen currently performing combat missions along the entire
line of contact, across the front.
Undoubtedly, the decisive role in the successes
of the Russian Armed Forces at the front belongs to our soldiers and officers.
In liberating the land of Donbass, they display courage and heroism, risking
their lives daily.
I would like to address them directly and emphasise the following.
Comrades,
You are setting a true example of service to the Fatherland, service to the Motherland, fulfilling your combat missions for the benefit of our great Russia.
I thank you for your valiant service to the Fatherland and wish you a happy upcoming New Year.

TITLE: Meeting with Deputy Minister of Defence Anna Tsivileva • President of Russia

Events
Meeting with Deputy Minister of Defence Anna Tsivileva
Vladimir Putin held a working meeting with State Secretary – Deputy Minister of Defence and Chair of the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation to support participants in the special
military operation Anna Tsivileva.
December 30, 2025
14:10
The Kremlin, Moscow
President of Russia Vladimir Putin
: Ms Tsivileva, today I would like
to discuss the aspect of your work that is directly related to the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation.
I know that a great deal is being done, but the most important thing is
the personal warmth and dedication you bring to this work. This is absolutely
essential in such matters. You must maintain this approach in the future. This
is exactly how we should interact with our service personnel who are defending our
Motherland.
That said, despite the extensive work being
done, as with any such undertaking, there will always be issues that require
particular attention. It is possible that some issues or problems arise, which
the state previously missed but must resolve now.
Please report on all these areas and, of course, on the results.
Deputy Minister of Defence
Anna Tsivileva
Tsivileva Anna
State Secretary – Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation
: Mr President,
Two and a half years ago, the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation was established by your Executive Order. Today, it
employs 4,300 social coordinators who carry out their duties not only in all
regions of the Russian Federation – our branches are present across the country – but also in municipalities, in small districts, towns, and villages. These
are the places where our veterans – participants in the special military
operation – return to, and where their families and friends live.
Perhaps the foundation’s main achievement is
that we have not simply organised our work in accordance with the Presidential
Executive Order and the charter but have created an entire socioeconomic
ecosystem. This system deals with rehabilitation and resocialisation, but most
importantly, the reintegration of our heroes, as well as their families –
particularly the vulnerable category of those who have lost loved ones or whose
relatives are missing in action.
Naturally, this work cannot be done
dispassionately. Thousands of our social coordinators and employees are
themselves participants in the special military operation or their relatives,
people who have travelled this path and now have the strength, desire and readiness to help others.
I would like to emphasise that this
work has been organised, in large part, thanks to our close and consistent
cooperation with other ministries and federal executive bodies. We have
established a highly effective interdepartmental cooperation framework. We
actively participate in the work of the Government, as well as the legislative
bodies: the State Duma and the Federation Council. We maintain ongoing
cooperation with all ministries and relevant federal executive authorities
whose decisions directly affect the integration of our veterans into civilian
life and the provision of assistance to them.
We also work in close coordination
with the security agencies: first and foremost with the Ministry of Defence,
the Prosecutor’s Office, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Guard
Service, the National Guard, and Rosfinmonitoring. In other words, with all
agencies that support our efforts and help address a wide range of issues that
arise. You are absolutely right in saying that we often face complex,
non-standard, and extraordinary challenges. The format you created – a state foundation
with a flexible rather than a rigid bureaucratic structure that works directly
with individual requests – has proven its effectiveness. This structure makes
it possible to act quickly and make decisions promptly, even in situations that
are new not only for us, but also for the state. Thanks to this coordinated
approach, decisions on assistance are made swiftly and reach our veterans in the shortest possible time.
Feedback is an essential task for us. Each veteran is supported by a dedicated social coordinator who works directly
with the individual and their family, fully understanding their specific
circumstances and needs. Our objective is not merely to resolve an issue or respond
to an inquiry, but to accompany the veteran through every stage until the matter is fully resolved. It is essential that a veteran knows that a social
coordinator is always there: a constant point of support and guidance
throughout their lives.
Over the two and a half years of our
operation, we have received approximately 2.3 million requests and appeals for various forms of assistance. Of these, 96 percent have been resolved
positively. In addition, the Federal Guard Service conducted a sociological
survey to assess the level of trust our core audience places in the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation. The results show a 90 percent approval rate, which
is a strong indicator of confidence and trust on the part of our beneficiaries.
What are our areas of focus and our
responsibilities? They mainly cover essential support services: obtaining
necessary documents, payments, ensuring access to state social security
benefits, offering free legal assistance, and arranging medical care, including
health resort treatment when needed. Special care is provided for those who are
injured, severely wounded, or disabled. They receive modern prosthetics –
including devices not listed on the federal programme – or, if necessary, we
pay an additional fee to the Social Fund to secure a certificate, allowing the individual
to obtain prosthetics that restore as much functionality as possible.
This marks a major advancement in the prosthetic field, which has evolved considerably over the past year and a half as we established a standard for prosthetic care. We are now funding not
just the prosthesis itself, but a full spectrum of services, including
rehabilitation, pre-fitting preparation, fitting, and training in prosthetic
use. Thanks to this comprehensive approach, our heroes can now genuinely lead
fully active lives.
During the prosthetic industry
exhibition at the Federation Council, Valentina Matviyenko and I were touring
the displays when we met some of our service members who, despite serious
injuries, had chosen to continue serving in the Ministry of Defence. They
shared how they had run a half marathon – nearly 22 kilometres – and were
training for a full marathon. Ms Matviyenko rightly remarked, “What kind of disabled persons are they? Few of those here could perform the work these guys
do.” And she was absolutely right. Therefore, reviewing regulations, including
legislative ones, has now become a routine part of our work because…
Vladimir Putin
: Any revisions must not, under any
circumstances, infringe the rights of our guys.
Anna Tsivileva
: Of course.
Vladimir Putin
: These changes should serve only to improve and stabilise their situation, never to make it worse.
Anna Tsivileva
: Exactly. Our initiatives are
driven entirely by the veterans’ own requests; they do not infringe their
rights but instead provide them with additional opportunities. We often receive
inquiries on key issues such as acquiring new skills, retraining, and further
education. This also extends to employment and resocialisation, aiming for the full integration of individuals into society, regardless of their disabilities.
In other words, we have
fundamentally reshaped society’s perception of people with disabilities. They
are no longer seen merely as individuals in need of help, but as people with
the opportunity to lead active lives, benefit the state, and fully pursue their
goals and aspirations. This represents an entirely new mindset, one inspired by the veterans themselves through their proactive approach to life and their
determination to continue serving the state, even in civilian roles.
This [presentation] briefly covers our spheres
of activity in figures. One of them is medical assistance. We consider it
important to conduct a medical examination of those who return [from the special military operation] because medical support they will receive from
healthcare facilities depends on the state of their health. Based on the results of medical examination of 65,000 such people, we have identified health
issues in 55,000 cases and new medical conditions in 12,000 cases. Checking up
on your health is really very important, especially since our heroes do not pay
much attention to their health. Like other people, they sometimes have latent health
issues. If left unattended, they can eventually reactivate, whereas
comprehensive health screening helps young people take care of their health,
improving their health or dealing with medical problems that got worse during
the hostilities.
The family factor is extremely important.
According to statistics, rehabilitation is much more effective when you have a close relative by your side. We encourage families to accompany our heroes
during rehabilitation programmes and even cover the cost of these trips.
Other issues have to do with providing
technical means of rehabilitation. It is also important that we help improve
living conditions in houses and flats where people with disabilities live. This
is very important; it makes everyday life more comfortable for them and their
families. This includes specialised kitchens, bathrooms, special openings, and smart home equipment. If they decide to work from home, which some of them do,
especially those who are wheelchair-bound or have lost their eyesight, we
provide the necessary equipment so that they can work from home and also
receive new competencies, for example, online.
We have a wonderful programme used at School
21, Sberbank’s school of digital technology, where IT professionals, including
those who were seriously wounded or have lost their eyesight, are trained
remotely.
Speaking about prosthetic devices, our men are
good athletes seriously engaged in sports.
As for retraining and employment, it is an extremely important sphere, as I have pointed out. Moreover, it is very
important for us to help our veterans expand their horizons. In this photo you
can see our veteran, a long-haul driver. We travelled with him in his KAMAZ
truck. The KAMAZ manufacturer has started making hand-controlled trucks and buses, including public transport, which we have seen at the Abilympics
competition in Kazan, so that our veterans can use prosthetic legs and arms to resume their profession.
Of course, there is great demand for our
programme of providing vehicles to double amputees. Our men not only gladly use
them to work and spend time with their families but also willingly take part in rallies and even take extreme driving courses.
Certainly, we engage our veterans in sporting
and cultural events. Sports play a vital role for them. We have individuals
with prosthetics who go mountaineering. There was an instance this year of them
climbing Mount Elbrus. We have a team that plays rugby and goes skiing, having
mastered these sports while using prosthetics. They also take part in snowboarding. Indeed, the demand for active sports is very high
This serves not only as a means of improving
health, but also as a tool for resocialisation, as it transforms a combat
brotherhood into a sporting one. They come together, share experience, support
each other, feel much more at ease and confident, and, of course, challenge one
another to competitions and various contests. They meet and communicate very
actively.
Regional governors also provide active support,
and we regularly hold Defenders of the Fatherland Cup competitions.
A particularly important area is our veterans’
participation in the patriotic education of young people and in preserving the memory of our heroes, their comrades-in-arms. Memorial plaques are being established,
and various projects are being developed that truthfully convey the story of a comrade’s feat. We have already published an entire trilogy – three books
written by veterans themselves, our heroes who are participants in the special
military operation.
Vladimir Putin
: Are they the authors?
Anna Tsivileva
: Yes, they are the authors.
These books have now been eagerly taken up by our film directors and producers, with plays being staged in the regions based
precisely on these real-life stories and accounts written by our heroes.
I would also like to note that we have actively
implemented the instructions on which you gave us your support, and they have
proven to be very necessary and in demand. As I mentioned earlier, this
includes the distribution of vehicles. But we also had another project – the design, production, and distribution of adaptive clothing for our veterans,
taking into account their specific conditions and injuries.
This is particularly important work, and it
originated from seeing, during meetings with veterans, how they would adapt
regular clothing for themselves, cutting and sewing it themselves. This is, of course, unsatisfactory. We now have a project we named On Wings, which brought
together our designers and clothing manufacturers to begin producing stylish,
fashionable clothing for various purposes. This includes business suits,
sportswear, casual wear, and even evening attire for formal events, all
tailored to the specific needs of individuals with disabilities.
Through the Defenders of the Fatherland
Foundation, we distribute such sets – comprising winter, summer, and demi-season outfits as complete collections. The greatest number of requests is
precisely for this clothing. It allows our veterans, these young men, to feel
fashionable and stylish, which is their wish. One of their key desires is for this clothing not to highlight their disability but to be like everyone else’s.
That is our objective here.
Furthermore, for those who continue to serve
within the structures of the Ministry of Defence and security agencies,
clothing and military uniforms are now being developed with account for disabilities, prosthetics, and even specialised footwear.
This is very important.
Another project we have implemented with you is
the effort to expand the scope of the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation’s
work to include the families of those missing in action. This initiative now
allows us to provide these families with crucial support, including
psychological support. Their members often become psychologists themselves and it gives them a chance to process their own grief, fosters a powerful sense of community and shared purpose; this peer support model helps them find respite
from their grief.
Many of the women who have themselves lost
loved ones have become trained psychologists and our foundation staff.
Furthermore, we offer this category of beneficiaries comprehensive assistance
in securing due payments and legal support.
A particularly sensitive issue has also been
successfully resolved. Combat veteran status has now been granted to individuals
from special military units who contracted with the Ministry of Defence
directly from penal institutions. The core concern was one of perceived
inequity, as these individuals had demonstrably atoned for past offences
through their service. Their persistent request for formal veteran recognition and the full spectrum of social benefits that accompany it has now been fulfilled
thanks to your support. This matter is now resolved.
Pursuant to the Minister’s instruction, we are
actively digitalising the Defence Ministry’s operations, specifically social
support mechanisms. A key example is the certificate of participation in the special
military operation. Previously, obtaining this document involved months of bureaucratic procedures. Now, it is accessible almost instantly with a single
click through the government services portal. This certificate is directly
linked to approximately 70 percent of state-provided social support measures.
Furthermore, we are developing a unified data
platform, or “data mart.” This system will integrate all support measures
available to a veteran based on their region of residence. All regions will be
connected to this platform by the end of the current year. Its primary benefit
is proactive, simplified access: veterans will be able to obtain information
via the government services portal about support measures for which they are
eligible.
Therefore, digital transformation is a critical
priority for us – given the scale of our mission, the requirements we must
meet, and, most importantly, our own internal drive to deliver these
improvements as quickly as possible.
We would also like to make a proposal.
First of all, we would like to thank you for the extensive support you have
provided and for helping us implement a large number of important initiatives. However,
there are several issues I would like to raise.
The first concerns active-duty
military personnel who currently fall outside the scope of the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation, as our mandate formally applies only to those who have
been discharged from the security services.
Vladimir Putin:
There are those who choose to remain in service.
Anna Tsivileva:
Exactly. Among them are soldiers
who, despite having sustained severe injuries or disabilities, continue their
service. They undoubtedly deserve the same level of care and support. This
includes access to prosthetics, technical rehabilitation equipment, the adaptation of their living conditions, as I mentioned earlier, and the opportunity to participate in sporting events, including covering travel
expenses for competitions such as the Defenders of the Fatherland Cup. This
category of soldiers regularly turns to us for assistance.
At present, we are addressing these
needs through extra-budgetary resources and sponsors. However, we believe this
assistance should be provided on a systemic basis. Young men who became
disabled as a result of combat-related injuries should also fall within our
scope of care in terms of support in these areas.
The second category includes those
who participated in counter-terrorism operations in our border regions. We
propose extending our coverage to include them as well.
These are the issues and requests we
have. The Supervisory Board has approved this proposal, and we respectfully ask
for your support in amending the relevant Executive Order.
Vladimir Putin:
Let us do this. What difference
does it make whether combat operations took place in a border area or in the special
military operation zone? Formally, there is no difference. These individuals
were defending the Fatherland under life-threatening conditions, and they
sustained serious injuries. For the state, and for society, this distinction
should not exist. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to extend this support
to both categories.
As for the first group, this is
equally self-evident. Perhaps this situation was not fully considered
previously: if a person remains in service within the Armed Forces, it may
appear that they remain under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defence. But
that should not concern us. It should not matter. A person took part in hostilities and was seriously wounded; of course, the state has an obligation
to ensure they can feel fully in-demand, not
only within their service in the Ministry of Defence, but also beyond it. As you rightly noted, they should have full access to sports and to housing
adapted to their post-injury needs. This must, without question, be done.
I would like to thank you and everyone working at the foundation, not only for the results you have achieved,
but also for the sincere and caring attitude toward your work and toward
people. This is the most important thing. I see that our men recognise this,
feel it, understand it, and support your efforts. For my part, I will do
everything possible to ensure that this work continues to be carried out as effectively as possible.
Thank you, Ms Tsivileva.

Events
Maria Lvova-Belova met with families facing difficult situations
Commissioner for Children’s
Rights Maria Lvova-Belova met with families in need of reinstating parental rights
or lifting restrictions on such rights. The meeting took place at the Presidential
Executive Office.
December 15, 2025
15:00
Moscow
Regional representatives also took part in the event via videoconference. The meeting participants reviewed situations
involving six families.
Two mothers from the Ulyanovsk Region came to Moscow with similar requests: both are
seeking to have their parental rights reinstated in respect of children who
will soon turn 18. The Commissioner for Children’s Rights noted that in both
cases she would petition for the expedited consideration of the women’s
applications. It was agreed that colleagues from the region would support the mothers
and their children throughout the reunification process.
Maria Lvova-Belova
Lvova-Belova Maria
Presidential Commissioner for Children’s Rights
also took personal oversight
of the situation in two families from the Trans-Baikal Territory. In one case,
a father has been raising his two daughters alone since the death of his wife. The younger child is currently in an institution, and the father has so far been unable
to have his parental rights reinstated due to the lack of documentation proving
that he has been treated for alcoholism. He has achieved a stable remission, has
a job and maintains a good relationship with the girls. The Commissioner for Children’s Rights noted that regional specialists would help the father in re-filing
his claim and would invite a narcologist to testify in court.
Additionally, two mothers from the Khabarovsk Territory
will receive support through the regional resources of the Vyzov (Challenge) special
project.
As Maria Lvova-Belova noted, such meetings make it
possible to identify the most common challenges faced by mothers and fathers seeking
to have their parental rights reinstated. Going forward, these issues will be
submitted for consideration by the interagency working group on assistance to families with children and the prevention of social orphanhood.

At thematic panels chaired by regional governors, the meeting participants discussed key issues related to personnel training, such as forecasting labour market needs, career guidance
models, developing a national qualifications system, and the role of employers
in professional development, including for veterans of the special military
operation, training of highly qualified personnel to ensure technological
leadership and training of specialists for the digital economy.
In his remarks, Maxim Oreshkin
outlined three horizons for personnel training: overcoming the labour shortage,
fine-tuning the education system, and responding to technological challenges related
to the introduction of autonomous systems, artificial intelligence, and platform solutions, all of which are driving significant changes in the labour
market.
Alexei Dyumin noted that the expanded meeting of the Commission is addressing issues of critical importance,
as a wide range of economic sectors are experiencing a shortage of specialists.
The personnel training system is failing to keep pace with employers’
constantly evolving demands. Mr Dyumin emphasised that the goals of achieving
technological leadership, as set by the President, and mastering new
technologies that are entering our lives require substantial human potential.
He stressed that ensuring adequate personnel was a complex task affecting not
only economic development but also the country’s defence capability.
Anton Kotyakov reported that the unemployment rate in the country currently stands at 2.2 percent. The number of unemployed citizens is virtually equal to the number of job vacancies. In the 30–39 and 40–49 age groups, labour market participation has practically reached
its peak. Further economic growth will depend directly on the increase of labour
efficiency. There are also skills-related challenges: new technologies require
a systematic update of current workers’ competencies. According to forecasts,
by 2032, an average of 1.7 million people will need to enter the economy
annually, which is comparable to the number of graduates. Key objectives
include accurate forecasting of future demand, high-quality career guidance,
aligning needs and training programmes, as well as expanding continuing
education in line with new technological developments.
In his speech, German Gref addressed
the role of artificial intelligence in tackling human resource challenges.
The expanded meeting of the State Council Commission
on Human Resources confirmed the effectiveness of a joint approach to addressing these issues and made it possible to identify priority areas for personnel policy for the coming period. The participants discussed all the proposals
in detail and refined the wording of the initiatives. The finalised materials
will be included in the draft list of presidential instructions for the upcoming State Council meeting, scheduled for the end of the year.

Events
Meeting of Russia’s Maritime Board
The Maritime Board of the Russian Federation held its meeting.
December 23, 2025
18:30
The meeting of the Maritime Board was chaired
by Aide to the President
Nikolai Patrushev
Patrushev Nikolai
Aide to the President
and attended by ministers and heads
of departments, maritime regions and organisations involved in the maritime
sector.
The discussion focused on the drafting of a comprehensive project for the development of the Russian Federation Arctic zone
of and the Trans-Arctic Transport Corridor.
At the meeting, the main approaches to shaping
this comprehensive project were proposed; it is expected that it would become a strategic planning document containing a system of interconnected investment
and innovation projects based on the territorial principle and aimed at achieving Russia’s national development goals and ensuring a comprehensive

Events
Ruslan Edelgeriyev took part in the 30th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change
The Russian delegation
has completed its work at the 30
th
session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP30), held in Belem,
Brazil, on November 10–21, 2025. A key outcome of the session was the adoption
of a balanced package of decisions that does not undermine the national
interests of energy-producing states.

On the sidelines of COP30, Special Presidential Representative for Climate and Water

Ruslan Edelgeriyev
Edelgeriyev Ruslan
Aide to the President
held a series of bilateral meetings with
high-ranking representatives from the Republic of Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico, and Venezuela. During these meetings, the parties
aligned their positions on key negotiation tracks and agreed to deepen
cooperation.
In the course of his bilateral engagements and public statements, the Presidential
Aide consistently advocated the position that climate action must not become a tool for discrimination in international trade or a threat to global energy
security. He underscored that the pathways for implementing a just energy transition
must be determined independently by each state, with due consideration for national circumstances and socioeconomic development priorities.
During the negotiations, the Russian Federation, in coordination with a broad group of developing countries, succeeded in preventing the adoption of aggressive
scenarios for a forced phase-out of hydrocarbon-based energy. Consequently, the final document contains no mention of the roadmap, proposed by several states,
for the complete cessation of fossil fuel use.
A significant
outcome was the approval of the Republic of Turkiye as the chair of the next
climate conference, COP31, to be held in 2026. On behalf of the Russian
Federation, the Special Presidential Representative for Climate and Water
Resources provided comprehensive and consistent support for Ankara’s bid throughout
months of consultations, recognising Turkiye as a strategic partner capable of ensuring
constructive and inclusive dialogue at the future conference.
The Russian
delegation also participated constructively in deliberations on other matters.
In particular, Russia supported the decision to scale up adaptation finance by developed countries for the benefit of developing nations.
The Russian Federation will continue its
responsible participation in the negotiation process, remaining committed to implementing the Paris Agreement based on the principles of fairness and common
but differentiated responsibilities.

Events
Meeting of the Council for Interethnic Relations Presidium
Deputy Chief
of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Magomedsalam
Magomedov chaired a meeting of the Presidium
of the Presidential Council for Interethnic Relations.
December 17, 2025
16:00
Opening the first meeting of the Presidium of the Council with newly appointed members, Magomedsalam
Magomedov reviewed the Council’s performance during the year. The Deputy Chief
of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office noted that the situation in the sphere of interethnic relations remained stable and controllable
despite ongoing attempts by foreign anti-Russian centres to precipitate social
unrest in order to drive a wedge between the peoples of Russia. In this regard,
in the coming year, it is planned to place greater emphasis on strengthening
unity and interethnic harmony, implementing state ethnic policy in the regions
and municipalities, timely forecasting and responding to conflicts, and increasing the effectiveness of civil society institutions.
The main outcome of the work
this year was the meeting of the Council for Interethnic Relations chaired by the President, during which Vladimir Putin supported the vision developed by the Council regarding the goals and priority areas of state ethnic policy for the coming decade, subsequently approving the State National Policy Strategy to 2036. In addition, an initiative to designate 2026 as the Year of Unity of the Peoples of Russia in the Russian Federation was endorsed.
Head of the Federal Agency for Ethnic Affairs Igor Barinov provided information on the progress in drafting
the federal plan of activities to implement the Strategy in 2026–2028. The participants
approved the document in general and offered several suggestions. Concluding
the discussion on this matter, Magomedsalam Magomedov had the following to say,
“Given that the public authorities of the constituent entities of the Russian
Federation and local self-government bodies are encouraged to follow the provisions of the State National Policy Strategy in carrying out their
activities and drafting plans in this sphere, a unified framework of planned
activities for implementing the Strategy, aligned with common benchmarks,
should be created across the country. It is imperative to provide guidelines when
working with the regions.”
During the meeting, the participants
also reviewed matters related to planning and organising the work of the Council in 2026. A new structure of working bodies was approved. The following
commissions were created: Commission on Strengthening National Civic Identity;
Commission on Preserving Russia’s Ethnocultural and Linguistic Diversity; Commission
on Legislation, Ensuring Interethnic Harmony, and Preventing Extremism; Commission
on Media Support and International Cooperation; Commission on Regional Aspects
of State Ethnic Policy and Promotion of Civil Society Institutions. The
scientific support was
entrusted to the Scientific Council of the Russian Academy of Sciences on Complex Problems of Ethnicity and Interethnic Relations.
Decisions on the matters at hand have been made at the end of the meeting.

Events
Expanded meeting of the Council for State Policy on Promoting the Russian Language and Languages of the Peoples of the Russian Federation
The third, expanded-format
meeting of the Council for State Policy on Promoting the Russian Language and Languages of the Peoples of the Russian Federation took place.
November 19, 2025
18:00
Opening the meeting, Chair of the Council,
Presidential Adviser Yelena Yampolskaya reported on the implementation of the President’s instructions issued following previous meetings. Council members
and invited experts presented detailed reports on each assigned area.
Ms Yampolskaya highlighted the development of unified state textbooks on the Russian language and literature,
which are expected to be phased into the educational process beginning
September 1, 2027. She also referred to the forthcoming law restricting
excessive Latinisation and the use of foreign borrowed words in public spaces,
set to take effect on March 1, 2026; the nationwide revival of recitation
programmes in schools and colleges effective from September 1, 2025; and the creation of 2,500 school literary clubs across the country, which have already
proven highly popular among schoolchildren.
Yelena Yampolskaya reminded
participants that in early November 2025, the President signed Executive Order
establishing September 8 as the Day of Languages of the Peoples of the Russian
Federation. She added that, at the President’s instruction, a draft federal law
on the languages of the peoples of Russia has been prepared and will soon be
submitted to the State Duma for consideration.
Yelena Yampolskaya made several
proposals, among other things suggesting holding a nationwide online video
competition titled Reading with the Whole Family to promote family reading
traditions. She also emphasised the need to improve preschool education by ensuring that kindergartens are supplied with high-quality children’s
literature.
Director General of the Znaniye (Knowledge)
Society Maxim Dreval presented the results of the Rodnaya Igrushka (Native Toy)
nationwide competition, aimed at developing games and toys rooted in traditional Russian spiritual and moral values. This year, around 150,000 such
games and toys are expected to be produced. At Ms Yampolskaya’s suggestion, the second stage of the competition in 2026 is expected to focus on toys designed
for preschool institutions. Maxim Dreval also spoke about continued efforts to promote the mobile game Say It in Russian, which aims to popularise the Russian
language among young people and reduce the use of Anglicisms.
The meeting participants also
discussed the development of a programme to update school library collections
by March 1, 2026; preparations for the first International Forum of School
Librarians, scheduled to take place in Moscow in December 2025; measures to improve the quality of training for primary school teachers; the opening of a cultural and educational interactive space for the promotion of the Russian
language at the Vladivostok branch of the Russia National Centre on September 4, 2025; and the organisation of the Nikolai Dobronravov National Poetry
Competition, which will kick off on November 22, 2025, and will be open to poets aged 14 and older.
Following the meeting, Yelena Yampolskaya will
prepare a report to the President containing proposals for the further
improvement of state language policy.

Events
Meeting of the Commission for Veteran Affairs
Deputy Prime Minister
Tatyana Golikova held a regular meeting of the Presidential Commission on Veterans’ Affairs. The discussion focused on the provision of medical care to veterans of the Great Patriotic War and participants in the special military
operation.
November 14, 2025
11:20
In Russia, the provision of medical
care to veterans of the Great Patriotic War and equivalent categories of citizens is under ongoing monitoring. As of October 1, routine medical
examinations have been conducted for more than 124,000 veterans of the Great
Patriotic War, including 67,700 who received home visits. Subsequently, based
on the results of these examinations, medical care was provided to 107,000
veterans, with 66,000 receiving treatment in their homes.
Special attention is also given to those who defended the country during the special military operation. A new
section, Procedure for Providing Medical Care to Combat Veterans, has been
incorporated into the state programme for guaranteeing free medical care to citizens for 2025–2027. This procedure grants combat veterans priority access
to all types of medical care.
Key provisions also include access
to spa treatment, the right to choose a convenient primary healthcare facility
with a designated personal coordinator, the right to consultation with a medical psychologist at all stages of care, and various aspects related to routine
medical examinations and follow-up for veterans.
Following the meeting, a number of instructions were issued to the Ministry of Health to be implemented in coordination with the regions.

The agenda includes regional experience, measures to support student
families, the introduction of corporate demographic standards, the protection
of reproductive health, and proposals on addressing housing problems of families with children.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin:
Colleagues,
Today, we are holding the first meeting of the
Council
for the Implementation of State Demographic and Family Policy. We will evaluate what
has been accomplished, and outline further steps in our joint work.
I want to emphasise right away that supporting families and creating
conditions that enable the birth of as many children as possible in Russia is a crucial and, effectively, a cross-cutting trend of all our national projects and strategic development plans. It permeates practically all spheres of life and encompasses everything that is needed and important for our people.
This is an absolute priority because it concerns the future of our
country. In this regard, it is particularly important for the state, the business community, civil society, and leaders of our traditional religions to coordinate
and consolidate their efforts. Additionally, we all need support from the media,
as well as well-aligned actions at all levels and in all areas, actions based
on a single line of logic.
The Council’s composition – and it includes representatives of federal
and regional authorities, public and non-profit organisations, scientific and entrepreneurial communities – undoubtedly reflects the commitment to a comprehensive, system-wide approach to addressing the tasks we face. I hope
that today we will discuss specific proposals aimed at making our policy on demographic
development and support for families more effective and robust.
Colleagues,
Falling birth
rates have become a global trend and a global challenge in the modern world. While
not in all countries are affected equally, many, particularly economically developed
nations, face this issue, and Russia is unfortunately no exception. Additionally,
as you know, we suffer from the effects of two demographic pitfalls, as we call
them: the tragic losses of WWII, the Great Patriotic War, and the crisis of the 1990s, which took place just after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Different countries
respond to this demographic challenge in various ways, including the encouragement
of uncontrolled, and even chaotic migration to replace the native population, often
sacrificing their identity and culture, and, importantly, their internal political
stability.
Our choice is
unequivocal: we support the family as the fundamental basis of Russian society
and aim to protect and preserve genuine family values and traditions, which have
united and strengthened our country for centuries.
It is my deep
conviction that we can only address the demographic challenge by developing our
own demographic potential, by preserving and increasing the number of all native
peoples in Russia, supporting large family traditions, and implementing programmes
to bring home our compatriots, Russian and Russian-speaking people who form the core of our society.
This approach
guarantees our future, preserves the ethno-cultural balance in Russian society
and strengthens our sovereignty.
I have said
on many occasions that families with three or more children should be seen as a standard and natural way of life in our country. In this regard, internal
guidelines, people's beliefs, and their priorities hold immense, sometimes
decisive, importance.
According to sociologists, an increasing number of our citizens express a desire to have
large families.
In 2005, our citizens
believed that a family should have 2.4 children (this is statistical data – the figure may sound strange for the media representatives present here, but
statisticians consider this normal) and now this figure is over three children,
and this trend is very important.
And one more thing. I believe that you will, most likely, discuss this issue today. Ms Valentina
Matviyenko and I have agreed that I will speak and then will leave you to attend to my routine matters, and you will continue working in these wonderful
Kremlin interiors under the supervision of Ms Matviyenko. But this is what I would like to say. Ms Tatyana Golikova is focusing on this issue all the time
when communicating with her colleagues in the Government, and she persistently
revisits this issue when engaging with me – how to provide financial
support for families. This is absolutely correct. It is very hard to address
demographic issues without this.
But,
of course, inner moral values, attitudes and principles are much stronger and more important. Did Russian peasant households earn average European-style
incomes? No, they did not, but each peasant family had seven to ten
children. Their values and attitudes
were different. This is what underlies demographic policy, and this should lie
at its foundation.
It
is now very important (I believe this is
also one of the Council’s objectives) to promote and uphold the internal attitude that I have mentioned, that tendency of the internal attitude that I just spoke about, so that the desire to create a family, to marry and to have many children becomes prevalent in the public mentality.
Certainly,
no pressure should be exerted in this sphere. A decision to have a child is,
certainly, a private and personal matter of any person, any family. However, we
should work jointly and make sure that people (young people, in the first
place) would sincerely aspire to a happy motherhood, would aim to effectively
raise their children, and that they would feel confident that the state will
support them whenever necessary, lend them a helping hand, and that it will do
everything possible to prevent living standards from deteriorating following
the birth of children but would, rather, raise the family status.
You know, we have already
created an entire range of essential tools for providing this support. I am
talking about maternity capital, flat-rate benefits for low-income families and low-interest mortgages. I would also like to recall that, from 2025, regions
whose birth rates fell short of average Russian levels in 2023 received
additional funding for implementing birth rate expansion programmes. In 2025–2030, 41 regions will receive about 75 billion
rubles. The family taxation initiative will be launched in early 2026; it will
reduce income tax levels to six percent for low-income families raising two
children and more.
When
formulating support measures, we base them on the real needs of families. What
would I like to highlight in this regard? It is clear that large families,
whose expenses are always significant, find it more difficult to purchase a larger flat or house on their own. Support measure is therefore available,
including a payment of 450,000 roubles from the state to help repay mortgages.
In several
regions, local authorities are actively addressing the housing needs of large
families. Overall, I would like to reiterate that tackling demographic
challenges and supporting families is a shared responsibility, one that
involves all levels of government, from federal to municipal. It is essential for regions to take a proactive approach and develop their own solutions. As an example of effective regional policy in this area, I would like to highlight
the work being done in the Nizhny Novgorod Region. The governor described this
to me in detail during my working visit there. The region’s initiatives include
several significant support measures, foremost among them regional family
capital, which provides monthly payments to families for three years following
the birth of a child – whether it is the first, second, third, or subsequent
child. Moreover, every family, regardless of income level, receives support
upon the birth of a child.
What else
do I think is important to highlight? Young people today – not only in Russia –
often postpone having children, believing they should first focus on other
goals. But as time passes, it can turn out that the best years for starting a family have been irretrievably lost. Our task is to help young people
understand that they do not have to choose one path over another but can
successfully combine parenthood with studying or building a career. Yes, it may
be challenging, but it is possible, and it is important to balance these
responsibilities with raising a child.
Of course,
this requires significant effort and hard work, but the state stands ready to provide assistance and support. We must continue to remind people of something
that may seem obvious but still needs to be said aloud: fatherhood and motherhood are a source of joy, and there is no need to postpone happiness.
That is what truly matters. At the same time, it is also essential that we help
young people and families navigate this important stage of their lives.
Several relevant decisions have recently been made.
Pregnancy and childbirth benefits have been increased for full-time
students. In some regions, lump sum payments have been approved for pregnant
students. Universities are opening baby care rooms and part-day child care
groups. We should certainly encourage everything that is being done in this
sphere, primarily in the system of higher education but also at secondary
education establishments.
I know that the Federation Council helped organise a Festival of Student
Families in July, as Ms Matviyenko has told us. I believe it was held at Bauman
University.
Federation Council Speaker
Valentina
Matviyenko
Matviyenko Valentina
Chairwoman of the Council of Federation
:
Yes,
this is true.
Vladimir Putin:
I consider it important to continue to improve
support measures for young families, including student families. I also hope
that the Demography Council will make a practical contribution to this.
Overall, we must regularly analyse the effectiveness of the measures we
are taking in the sphere of family policy, improving the system of social
support to make it as transparent as possible, understandable and convenient
for families with children. It should be
applied proactively and ultimately help people achieve their dreams of a big
and close-knit family with many children.
Of course, financial and social support measures, both federal and regional ones, are extremely important. I would like to emphasise that business,
our large companies are becoming involved in this work and are implementing
corporate programmes for young families.
At the same time, I would like to repeat that the solution of demographic problems begins with each family and, as I have already stated,
with the people’s attitude and world outlook. We see that the revival of genuine
family traditions has sparked widespread social response. It is not surprising
that the Our Family contest has become so popular. It is extremely important
for the values of respect for large families with many children and love for children as the nation’s future to become a unifying feature of the rising
generations.
I strongly hope that the Demography Council and its professional
competence will make a great contribution to the fulfilment of the tasks we
face and to the further development of our family and demographic policy for the benefit of our citizens and the country as a whole, of course.
Thank you very much. I would like to wish you success in your efforts.
Valentina
Matviyenko
: Mr
President, first of all, I would like to express my gratitude for your
participation in today’s Council meeting and for your unprecedented personal
commitment to demographic issues.
When the head of state, amidst numerous other pressing matters, addresses demographic
and family policy so systematically and substantively, it serves as a powerful
motivator for leaders at all levels of government, business executives, and other sectors.
Most
importantly, it is crucial for everyone to understand that this is not a situational programme, nor a temporary or one-off project, but rather a serious, long-term effort – and it is only through this approach that we will
yield results. This challenge must be addressed by society as a whole.
I would
also like to underscore separately that now, when society is truly consolidated
and patriotic, and when our citizens have gained a renewed appreciation for Russia’s value, for family, and for traditions, we have an excellent
opportunity to embark on a qualitatively new stage of demographic policy.
Do you
still have time, or must you leave?
Vladimir
Putin
: I must
leave, but I will stay and hear you out.
Valentina
Matviyenko
Matviyenko Valentina
Chairwoman of the Council of Federation
: Mr
President, I will be very brief.
You have
already noted that the Council established on your initiative comprises the finest specialists and professionals across various fields. Every Council
member recognises their personal responsibility.
Today, you
have set new additional tasks, and we will, of course, be guided by them.
Specific
working groups and an expert council have been formed within the Federation
Council. We are engaging a wide range of experts, with institutions of the Russian Academy of Sciences participating. I am aware that the Academy
President is present here today. On October 28, they will hold a dedicated
meeting of the Russian Academy of Sciences Presidium devoted to demographic
issues. So, as they say, the process is underway across society.
We have
established close cooperation with the Presidential Executive Office, the relevant State Council commission, the Government, and regional authorities.
Our team has analysed the full range of federal and regional support measures.
We have thoroughly studied international experience because, as you rightly
noted, this is a challenge for all developed nations – even China now faces
this serious challenge.
We have
prepared a number of proposals. We hope to formalise them as a list of your
instructions, should you agree, so that we receive your instructions to implement following today’s discussion.
The key issue is well known: housing. The family mortgage programme. Of course, thanks
to this initiative, millions of families have been able to acquire housing of their own. However, upon closer examination, Mr President, it turns out that
family mortgages are increasingly becoming a metropolitan mortgage, as more
than half of the preferential loans intended to boost the birth rate are being
issued in Moscow, St Petersburg, and the Moscow and Leningrad regions. We
believe it would be appropriate to refine this tool. It is necessary to create
conditions that allow families with children to improve their housing conditions
in the areas where they actually live, on their native land. This would, in turn, give a powerful boost for housing construction across the regions of the Federation, including smaller towns, and would promote planned territorial
development.
Given the particular focus on large families,
we also propose differentiating the family mortgage rate according to the number of children: the more children a family has, the lower the rate should
be.
A model of preferential, affordable rental
housing for families with children, as you have also mentioned, requires
further development. DOM.RF has already prepared specific proposals in this
regard, which Mr Mutko will present in more detail today.
You know, Mr President, dreams are inspiring.
Imagine, for example, if a third or fourth child were born into a family and the state were to grant them an apartment or a home of their own. This would,
of course, stimulate the development of individual and wooden housing
construction. We have vast forest resources for that. It is every family’s
dream, and such a measure would certainly serve as a strong incentive to have
more children.
We also believe that the time has come to improve the maternity capital
programme. It should now be reoriented towards supporting large families – the birth of a third and subsequent children. At present, maternity capital for a second or third child is significantly lower than for the first child. We
believed a similar approach should be applied to regional maternity capital
payments.
Overall, there should, in my view, be a unified philosophy: all
additional support measures, both federal and regional, should be directed
primarily towards encouraging the birth of third, fourth, and subsequent
children.
Infrastructure. You are, of course,
absolutely right to note that the state must provide the necessary
infrastructure: schools, educational facilities, clubs, and so forth. Yet this
family-centred approach must be applied in all areas: modern playgrounds,
barrier-free environments for strollers, and mother-and-child rooms in public
institutions. Among the proposals we have received from the regions and public
organisations are: the creation of designated parking spaces for large
families; exemption of children’s fares in taxis; and separate check-in counters for families with small children at airports, among others.
Our society has a strong,
long-standing tradition of special care for expectant mothers and children.
Undeniably, this deeply-held value must be translated into practical, everyday
benefits for families with children, which does not necessarily require
significant budget expenditures. We are ready (and are already acting) to prepare corresponding recommendations for businesses, regions, and federal
agencies.
Furthermore, it is crucial that
employers actively engage with demographic objectives. As this is a national
priority, businesses must also demonstrate their social responsibility by contributing. Progress is already underway: we are collecting information from
the regions, and a new national GOST corporate demographic standard has
recently been approved. While its application is currently voluntary, we
believe companies that implement high standards of demographic support should
be encouraged and incentivised and, all other things being equal, be entitled
to certain state preferences. This is only fair.
We must also streamline the system
of state support, as there are no trivial details in this endeavour. For instance, if a new mother receives a substantial one-time payment from her
employer for the birth of a child, this amount is currently counted as income.
As a result, she can lose her right to receive a flat-rate child care benefit.
We have submitted proposals to the Government, and a resolution is already
being prepared to exclude such employer payments from the calculation of average per capita family income. In our view, it would be logical to extend
this approach to other demographic support payments, regardless of their
source.
Our Council has also uncovered
startling situations, such as a working woman receiving no maternity benefits
at all. This can occur if her company is undergoing bankruptcy when she goes on maternity leave, leaving no source for the payment. We have rectified this by submitting new legislation, which has since been adopted; in such cases, payments
are now made by the Social Fund.
Here is another critical example. A woman may be de facto employed by a company but is formally registered as self-employed – an arrangement some businesses find economically efficient. The consequence is that when she becomes pregnant, she is not entitled to paid
maternity leave and is essentially thrust into financial limbo, with no
benefits or guarantees. While these issues might seem minor to some, they are
in fact vital, critical even, and we are committed to addressing them
thoroughly.
Finally, I would like to thank the Ministry of Labour and Minister Anton Kotyakov for supporting the law that increases
maternity benefits for new mothers who are university students. These benefits
have been raised almost tenfold, Mr President, representing truly significant
support.
You
mentioned the necessity of placing special emphasis on student families.
Considerable efforts have also been made in this regard. A non-reducible
standard of support for student families has been established. Specific
measures are being implemented by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education,
with university rectors and Minister of Science and Higher Education Valery
Falkov actively engaged in this agenda – many thanks to him for his commitment.
We are
currently preparing legislative amendments that will enable priority placement
in nurseries and kindergartens near universities for children from student
families.
Moreover,
Mr President, this is a highly significant issue – it is widely discussed. We
propose considering a more proactive development of nursery networks, both in residential areas and at universities, as well as at large enterprises.
Nurseries are absolutely essential for women to balance studies, work, and motherhood. Nearly all regions have fulfilled your instructions regarding
kindergarten construction. The programme has been implemented, and there is
virtually no shortage; however, nurseries remain inadequate. Women fear being
out of work for three years, thereby losing professional skills, and if they
have a second or third child, this period extends to six or nine years. Support
is needed for these three years before kindergarten. I believe we should
implement a nursery construction programme, including private ones, possibly by simplifying requirements for establishing such institutions, naturally without
compromising child safety.
We would
like to request that you instruct the Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoys to the Federal Districts to personally oversee demographic policy in the regions.
I would
like to cite an example – Igor Shchegolev – today, he can truly be called the Plenipotentiary Envoy for Demography, not just a Presidential Plenipotentiary
Envoy.
Special
thanks must be extended to the governors. They have genuinely excelled, fully
embracing their responsibilities. Demographic programmes have been adopted in all regions. I am confident they will begin to yield results.
It is also
crucial for the demographic agenda to receive adequate and appropriate media
coverage. Several years ago, Alexei Gromov and I convened a meeting with
leaders of all media communities: television, film, radio, internet, online and offline cinemas, and so on. We encountered absolute mutual understanding and agreed on many points. There are robust, substantive plans in place. Council
member Oleg Dobrodeyev will elaborate on this today.
I think I should conclude here.
Accurate statistics and population
surveys reflecting the realities are needed for correct managerial decisions.
Our Council has already delved deeply into the topic. It concerns, among other
things, measurements of demographic attitudes and reproductive plans of our
citizens.
However, we
have to exercise utter caution regarding various sociological studies that are
unprofessional, unscientific and incorrect. Sociology is a very complicated
science.
Objectives
studies are currently conducted by Rosstat (Federal State Statistics Service),
but regrettably, once every five years, while we need more updated information.
This is obviously not enough.
I have laid
out just some proposals, my colleagues will add up to them.
We keep analysing family support measures currently in effect, and identifying and scaling-up the most effective of them.
Mr President, we are about to mark the wonderful holiday –National Unity Day. I would like to remind the words of great Russian scientist Dmitry Mendeleyev, who was a great Russian patriot – the power of Russia is in its unity, in the military and the graceful family spirit that
multiplies the growth of the nation. That’s what we stand for. We shall do our best for our Fatherland to be strong, independent, sovereign, and, of course, with many large families.
Thank you
once again for your participation.
Vladimir
Putin
: Thank you,
Ms Matviyenko.
Once I have stayed here, let me say just a couple of words
to comment on your remarks.
You are obviously aware that the Government is
trying to preserve all kinds of mortgage loan tools. What has remained of the preferential
mortgage is intended to support basically families with children, both the six-percent family mortgage, the two-percent mortgage in some regions of Russia
that require our special attention and support for families with children, and so on.
We will definitely
keep improving everything, including private housing construction which last year and the year before ensured
a good growth of housing construction. This should evidently be also supported.
We indeed have a lot of forests, and you have
rightly said that some people like and will gladly live in the forest but not
everyone. Therefore, apart from forests, we need relevant infrastructure.
Valentina Matviyenko
: Mr President, I didn’t mean that. I meant that we have a lot of timber and we can step
up wooden housing construction. This clarification is to dispel possible misinterpretations of what I said.
Vladimir
Putin
: I see your
point, but with available timber we need infrastructure. It is not just timber –
it is pipelines, roads, communications, transport and other related things.
But this is
a very correct idea overall. Mr Mutko will tell us the share of private housing construction in the total housing construction growth. I think it was 50 percent.
DOM.RF General Director
Vitaly Mutko
Mutko Vitaly
General Director of DOM.RF
: Even as of today, the ratio is 60 to 40, with individual private housing making
up 60 percent. It grew by 40 percent. It’s
due to preferential mortgage expanded towards private houses purchasing and building.
Vladimir
Putin
: Indeed, this is the result of expanding
preferential mortgage to private housing construction. Do you see how impressive
the result is? I mean to say that you have generally expressed the right
things, and the Government is attending to exactly these matters.
Now, regarding maternity capital. You know,
this idea first came to me and my colleagues in the Government at that time, and it turned out to be a very successful one. Of course, we must now think on how
to improve this tool. We are making every effort to support it and to ensure it
is regularly adjusted for inflation.
But I would ask you to bear one thing in mind.
There is a constant temptation to use maternity capital to resolve various
issues. Naturally, families with children always face many of them, they are
endless. Yet the most important thing is not to allow these funds to be spent
on things that are secondary or insignificant.
Valentina Matviyenko:
That’s right.
Vladimir Putin:
People are different; they have different
goals and interests. Maternity capital must not be allowed to be squandered. Whatever
happens, interests of children and women are above all. Although the term
“family capital” is sometimes used, I deliberately called it maternity capital – and for good reason. We must prioritise the protection of women and children.
Therefore, I ask you to approach this matter with great care. Families have
fundamental needs, and that is the principle we must uphold.
Now, as for material support in general – of course, it is absolutely necessary. All our actions are aimed at providing it.
But I have already spoken about the ideological aspect of this issue. I think
you will all agree with me that demographic challenges appeared in many Western
European countries long before they emerged here, even back in Soviet times,
despite the much higher standard of living enjoyed by citizens in those
countries. Other problems have since arisen. I will not repeat them, but
demographers understand this well. Factors such as getting education,
post-university education, building a career, other ambitions, and the postponement of the birth of the first child, along with urbanisation and the broader effects of a post-industrial society, have all contributed. People’s
consciousness has changed, their priorities have shifted, their values and life
orientations have evolved. In general, this is not a bad thing –indeed, it is a sign of development – but it is important that the fundamental values
associated with the continuation of life, with the joy of childhood, and with
the happiness of motherhood and fatherhood, are preserved. These are things
that no amount of money can buy.
Of course, it is essential to create the right
conditions. As the saying goes, “we must not breed poverty” – and that is
entirely true. But one cannot replace the other. Value-based orientations are
important, and for that, joint and concerted efforts are crucial.
And, as I said at the beginning, we must
support people’s natural aspirations to have more children. This is absolutely
clear. We must do so through consistent, practical
actions, both in the material sphere and in social policy.
Ms Matviyenko mentioned baby nurseries. I absolutely agree on this point. Some regions have failed to resolve the kindergarten issues completely but the governors are attending to these matters,
and I am sure all the outstanding issues will soon be resolved. Basically,
everything has been completed, the programme has been completed. However, you are
right about baby nurseries to make sure that a woman does not drop out of a production process and does not lose her professional skills, which means a lot in the modern world as the situation is changing rapidly, the pace of changes is enormous, especially in production. It is crucial in this regard that a woman should have an opportunity to return to her job without losing qualification.
You are
certainly absolutely right, we have to address this issue. Ms Golikova, we have
repeatedly discussed this matter, and we must give it another thought, but certainly
without slacking safety requirements for these child care institutions. The requirements
may be changed, they must be up-to-date to embrace modern capabilities and materials,
equipment and everything else. Modern technologies allow for resolving many
issues of children’s facilities safety in a modern way, and that’s what we must
do. Therefore, the requirements must not be slackened but changed in accordance
with modern capabilities.
I would like
to finish with what I began with and what I repeatedly addressed – the inner motivation, the ideological beliefs of our society and what Ms Matviyenko referred to as respect for the very notion of childhood, fatherhood and motherhood.
Regarding motherhood – I think everyone is perfectly aware of that – yet I will say it again. All peoples of Russia
(we have many peoples, the Russian nation embraces over 100 ethnicities, to be
more exact,192 ethnicities living here, and we have been communicating with
each other for as many as a thousand years) have some beliefs common for all. I mean an attitude to mummy, to mother, which has a special sacred significance for all of us. Even our major traditional religions have the image of mother on icons as the central image. Just look at our basic religious values. What do they look like? A Madonna with the baby, she prevails. In other cultures, for example, in Europe, the main image is that of the Saviour. In our country, you know what is depicted on the icons. Do you get it? This is the first point.
Second, regarding patriotic education – one word is being passed over from generation to generation, which is natural for us – Motherland. In fact, mother and homeland are blended in our consciousness as one general image.
We must definitely
support these fundamental value-based attitudes in a talented, vivid and masterful way, including and above all with the active engagement of cultural figures and mass media representatives.
I want to wish you all the best in your today’s work.
Thank you
very much.

UGANDA AND THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA HOLD A POLITICAL CONSULTATIVE MEETING IN KAMPALA.
International
December 21, 2025
UGANDA AND THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA HOLD A POLITICAL CONSULTATIVE MEETING IN KAMPALA.
Kampala, Uganda — The Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Vincent Bagiire Waiswa, has today chaired high-level bilateral consultations with a delegation from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, led by H.E. Saqr Sulaiman Al-Qurashi, Director General for African Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom. The engagement forms part of structured political consultations aimed at strengthening Uganda–Saudi Arabia relations across diplomatic, economic and people-centred pillars.
Opening the meeting, Mr. Bagiire Vincent Waiswa the Permanent Secretary expressed appreciation for the enduring friendship between Uganda and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, noting that the relationship has matured into a practical partnership delivering tangible development outcomes. He welcomed the Saudi delegation and introduced the Ugandan technical team, emphasizing the consultative and forward-looking nature of the engagement.
Mr. Bagiire commended the Kingdom’s sustained contribution to Uganda’s socio-economic transformation, particularly in health, education and human capital development. He highlighted the strategic importance of the Naguru Heart Institute, supported by Saudi Arabia, which is expected to significantly ease pressure on the Uganda Heart Institute and strengthen national capacity in specialised cardiac care. Additional support to regional hospitals and vocational training institutions was recognised as a critical investment in inclusive service delivery and skills development. Education cooperation featured prominently, with recognition of Saudi Arabia’s longstanding support to the Islamic University in Uganda, which has grown from 88 students in 1989 to over 14,500 today. This growth reflects shared commitment to developing a skilled, values-driven generation capable of contributing to national, regional and global development.
On labour mobility, both sides acknowledged the economic and social value of Ugandan professionals working in the Kingdom, while candidly addressing challenges related to preparedness, cultural orientation and skills matching. The meeting agreed on the importance of enhanced pre-departure training, certification and standardised guidelines, implemented through closer collaboration between relevant ministries, embassies and recruitment agencies. These measures aim to safeguard workers’ welfare, improve outcomes for employers and strengthen confidence in labour cooperation frameworks.
The consultations also reaffirmed strong political alignment on regional and global issues, including peace and security in Africa and the Middle East. Uganda’s role in regional stability, particularly its peace initiatives and contribution to security in Somalia, was recognised as a foundation for shared prosperity and investment confidence. Turning to economic cooperation, the Permanent Secretary outlined Uganda’s ambition to position itself as a competitive destination for investment, value addition and tourism. He invited Saudi investors to partner in agro-industrial value chains, including coffee, meat, dairy, poultry, fish, fruits and horticulture, supported by improved standards, halal certification processes and modern testing laboratories. Opportunities for collaboration in science, technology and innovation, vaccine research, minerals development, and contextual digital solutions were also highlighted.
The PS further proposed collaboration on establishing a Saudi–Uganda Industrial Park, leveraging Uganda’s Free Zones regime to serve Middle Eastern and East African markets with tax-efficient, export-oriented production. Ongoing investments in regional road infrastructure and market connectivity were underscored as part of Uganda’s strategy to anchor stability through trade and shared growth.  The meeting concluded with a shared commitment to develop clear priorities, operational guidelines and a joint implementation mechanism to translate discussions into measurable results. Both sides expressed readiness to convene the Joint Commission and to sustain high-level exchanges, including a future visit by H.E. the President of the Republic of Uganda to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at a mutually convenient time. The engagement reaffirmed Uganda and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s shared vision of a partnership anchored in mutual respect, inclusive development, multi-sectoral investment and people-to-people ties—positioning both countries as trusted partners in a rapidly evolving global landscape.

SECOND UGANDA ANNUAL DIASPORA CONVENTION REAFFIRMS GOVERNMENT’S COMMITMENT TO INCLUSIVE GROWTH, PARTNERSHIP.
International
December 19, 2025
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has reaffirmed its strategic commitment to positioning the Ugandan diaspora as a central pillar of national development, global competitiveness, and economic transformation during the Second Uganda Diaspora Convention 2025. Convened under the theme: Economic and Commercial Diplomacy, the Convention
brought together Ugandans from across the world, senior government officials, heads of diplomatic missions, development partners, and private sector actors to consolidate dialogue, share policy direction, and co-create pathways for deeper diaspora engagement in Uganda’s growth agenda.
Welcoming participants, Amb. Johnny Muthahi Muhindo, Head of the Diaspora Department at MoFA, described the Convention as a maturing platform anchored in partnership, ownership, and results. He emphasized that the diaspora are no longer considered ad-hoc contributors to Uganda’s story, but are strategic partners in shaping shared prosperity. “This engagement is designed for you to speak to us to tell us what you bring, what works, and how we can jointly unlock Uganda’s full potential. The diaspora policy we are finalizing belongs to you, and your ownership is essential,” Amb. Muhindo noted. He highlighted ongoing benchmarking with countries such as India, Ethiopia, and Kenya, alongside comprehensive skills mapping initiatives, aimed at aligning diaspora expertise with Uganda’s development priorities. A draft Diaspora Policy, now at an advanced stage, has been widely circulated to ensure inclusivity, responsiveness, and long-term impact.
Representing the Permanent Secretary/Secretary to the Treasury, Mr. Joseph Enyimu, underscored the Government’s evolving policy outlook that positions the diaspora as investors, market connectors, skills carriers, and trusted ambassadors of Uganda’s economic brand. He noted that Uganda’s merchandise exports surpassed USD 10
billion by June 2025, rising to USD 11 billion when services are included, while acknowledging the urgent need to transition from commodity-based exports to value-added, technology-driven, and knowledge-intensive production.
“Achieving Uganda’s ambition of a USD 500 billion economy by 2040 will require more than policy reforms. It
demands market intelligence, trusted networks, and regulatory navigation strengths that the diaspora uniquely offers,” Mr. Enyimu stated. He reaffirmed Uganda’s strong macroeconomic fundamentals, resilient currency, expanding infrastructure, and preferential market access under EAC, COMESA, and AfCFTA, positioning the country as a gateway economy to the region and the continent.
In his opening remarks, Mr. Bagiire Vincent Waiswa, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, emphasized that protecting and promoting the interests of Ugandans abroad remains at the core of Uganda’s foreign policy. Uganda’s missions are being strengthened to function as coordinated economic delivery points while
remaining responsive to citizen welfare, emergency support, and service delivery, he noted. The PS further recognized the support of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in advancing structured diaspora engagement and announced plans to institutionalize a global celebration of the Ugandan diaspora beginning next year. Officially opening the Convention, Hon. Ruth Nankabirwa, Minister of Energy and Mineral Development, conveyed the greetings of H.E. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of the Republic of Uganda, and commended the diaspora for its sustained
contribution to Uganda’s socio-economic transformation.
She outlined key national reforms, including the rationalization of government agencies, expanded energy
infrastructure, and strengthened public financial management, which have redirected resources toward priority sectors such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Highlighting progress in the energy, oil and gas, agro-industrialization, tourism, and science and innovation sectors, the Minister reaffirmed Uganda’s readiness for scalable investment and industrial growth, anchored in stability, reform, and long-term planning. “You are our ambassadors. Your engagement, confidence, and participation, including in national processes, are vital to building a stronger, more inclusive Uganda,” she stated.
The Second Uganda Diaspora Convention 2025 reaffirmed a clear policy message: Uganda’s diplomacy is people-centered, economically driven, and globally engaged. The government is committed to finalizing a dynamic Diaspora Policy, professionalizing economic diplomacy across missions, and strengthening institutional frameworks that
support diaspora investment, skills transfer, and market access. As deliberations continue, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated its openness to constructive engagement and its resolve to work with Ugandans abroad as equal partners in shaping Uganda’s future.

2025/06/04 5:09:15
UN General Assembly Adopts Draft Resolution on “World Horse Day”
The 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly discussed and adopted the draft Resolution on proclaiming July 11 ‘World Horse Day,” initiated by President of Mongolia Khurelsukh Ukhnaa, on June 3, 2025.
Co-sponsors of the draft Resolution were 56 countries including
the Republic of Austria, the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Federative Republic of Brazil, the Republic of Korea, the People’s Republic of China, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the State of Qatar, the Kingdom of Lesotho, the Kingdom of Morocco, the Russian Federation, the Portuguese Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Kingdom of Thailand, the Republic of Türkiye, Japan, and five countries in Central Asia.
At present there are over 57 million horses in the world, and in many countries the horse industry plays an important role in the socioeconomic development and well-being of people and the promotion of equine welfare and specifically contributes to the daily lives and economic empowerment of the rural population and local communities through riding, transportation, horse racing, equestrian sports, tourism and recreational activities, as well as employment generation, food production and other businesses.
However, the number of horses and the equine industry are declining worldwide to some extent due to changes in lifestyles, pressure on the
industry from economic fluctuations, climate change, and environmental and other factors.
In light of this, as a representation of the nomadic peoples, who have preserved their equestrian cultures and traditions from ancient times, President of Mongolia Khurelsukh Ukhnaa initiated the draft Resolution at the General Assembly to proclaim July 11 of each year as “World Horse Day.” The purpose of this initiative is to raise international awareness, promote the significance of horses, and encourage public engagement in their preservation.
Introducing the draft Resolution, Mr. Ankhbayar Nyamdorj, Permanent Representative of Mongolia to the United Nations, described the horse as “one of the most important animals in human history” and pointed to its role in transportation, agriculture, farming, and mining, as well as recreational fields such as horse-racing and tourism.  The text aims to encourage concrete actions to support the equine industry and conserve horse cultural heritage.

Presidents of Mongolia and Turkmenistan Hold a Press Briefing
At the invitation of President of Mongolia Khurelsukh Ukhnaa, President of Turkmenistan Serdar Berdimuhamedow is paying a State Visit to Mongolia on June 1-2, 2025.
The two Heads of State held a press briefing on the outcomes of their official talks, emphasizing that the reciprocal State Visit in less than a year is a clear indication of the commitment to expanding the traditionally friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries.
President of Mongolia Khurelsukh Ukhnaa:
“Your Excellency, Mr. President Serdar Berdimuhamedow,
Representatives of the Press,
I extend my warm greetings to you all.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to His Excellency President of Turkmenistan Serdar Berdimuhamedow for accepting my invitation and paying a State Visit to our beautiful country of Mongolia, the land of ancient history and the eternal blue skies.
I am pleased to recall the first State Visit of the President of Mongolia in October 2024, to your beautiful country, which is the hub of the “Silk Road” connecting Asia and Europe and the White Fairy of Central Asia, at your invitation. This is the first State Visit of the President of Turkmenistan to Mongolia since the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries more than 30 years ago, and I would like to emphasize its extraordinary importance in opening a new page in the history of the relations and cooperation.
During the State Visit of Your Excellency, Mr. President, we reviewed the implementation and results of the cooperation documents signed during the State Visit of the President of Mongolia to Turkmenistan in 2024 and discussed in detail the further expansion of relations and cooperation. As a result of our official talks, we issued a Joint Declaration on Developing Bilateral Cooperation between Mongolia and Turkmenistan. I am confident that this document would set the future direction and define the roadmap of cooperation between the two countries and greatly contribute to expanding and developing relations between the two countries in all areas.
During the State Visit of the President of Mongolia to Turkmenistan in 2024, a number of documents were signed, including the Intergovernmental Agreements Aviation and Road Transport Relations and the Inter-Ministerial Agreement on Cooperation in the Livestock Sector, which laid the foundation for cooperation in the fields of transport, logistics, tourism, agriculture, and veterinary medicine. During the State Visit of the President of Turkmenistan, Your Excellency, we have signed 14 intergovernmental and inter-agency cooperation documents, enriching our relations with trade, economy, customs, light industry, science, culture, education, media, and healthcare cooperation.
Specifically, I would like to highlight the establishment of an Intergovernmental Agreement between Mongolia and Turkmenistan on Establishing a Joint Commission for Bilateral Cooperation, a General Intergovernmental Agreement between Mongolia and Turkmenistan on Economic Cooperation, and a Medium-Term Intergovernmental Program between Mongolia and Turkmenistan on Developing Cooperation in Trade, Economy, and Investment for 2026-2028.
Your Excellency, Mr. President,
I would like to highlight and express my deepest gratitude for your contribution and dedication to expanding and developing the traditionally friendly relations between Mongolia and Turkmenistan. It is delightful to note that the priority areas for bilateral cooperation agreed upon in Ashgabat in 2024 have already begun to be realized and put into tangible action.
In particular, we have established the Mongolia-Turkmenistan Inter-Governmental Commission under our agreement to create mechanisms aiming at strengthening cooperation. We have also established a Joint Committee on Road Transport, a Joint Committee on Agriculture, and a Joint Committee on Veterinary Medicine and Animal Husbandry, which would play a key role in expanding collaboration in these sectors. During the State Visit, we have signed a document on cooperation in the light industry sector, which lays the groundwork for joint projects and programs that would promote partnership in food, agriculture, light industry, and small and medium-sized enterprises.
Under the “White Gold” National Movement initiated by the President of Mongolia, we agreed to align Mongolia’s wool and cashmere production with Turkmenistan’s cotton and yarn spinning industries to manufacture knitwear and textiles, implementing projects that would serve as symbols of our bilateral relations. We believe this will be vital in expanding our trade turnover and diversifying the range of exported and imported goods.
Also, during the State Visit, a Mongolia-Turkmenistan Business Forum is taking place, along with a Turkmen carpet and handicrafts fair, which further strengthens the ties and network between the businesses and producers, promotes our countries to one another, and boosts people-to-people exchanges. I would like to express my gratitude for the first Joint Cultural Performance held in Ulaanbaatar under the auspices of the Presidents of the two countries, where Turkmen artists have brought musical joy to their Mongolian friends with the rich culture and arts of Turkmenistan, creating warm and lasting memories together.
Mr. President, as we agreed to make education cooperation a priority area of bilateral relations, we signed a document that will serve as the basis for close cooperation in education and science. I am confident that enrolling students from the two countries into government scholarship programs would nurture the skilled professionals who would act as bridges between Mongolia and Turkmenistan.
Under our decision to foster city-to-city cooperation, I am pleased to note that Ulaanbaatar and Ashgabat have established sister-city relations. We have also mutually affirmed our commitment to intensify cooperation within the United Nations and other international organizations. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the UN’s recognition of Turkmenistan’s status of permanent neutrality. I extend my heartfelt congratulations on this milestone to you, Mr. President, and, through you, to the friendly people of Turkmenistan.
I would also like to express my gratitude to Turkmenistan for acceding as a full member to the “Multilateral Agreement on the Establishment of an International Think Tank for Landlocked Developing Countries” initiated by Mongolia. I am confident that Turkmenistan would actively participate in the Institution’s efforts to overcome the challenges facing landlocked developing countries, formulate development policies, and facilitate the exchange of experience.
I am fully confident that our talks and mutually agreed-upon decisions will be realized for the prosperity of our two countries and the well-being of our two peoples, and that the relations and cooperation between our two countries will expand and strengthen further. May the friendship between our two peoples continue to grow stronger from generation to generation, and may the friendly relations and cooperation between Mongolia and Turkmenistan flourish forever.
I warmly welcome you to our beautiful country of Mongolia, the land of ancient history and eternal blue skies.
Thank you for your attention.”
President of Turkmenistan Serdar Berdimuhamedow:
“The official talks between the Turkmen and the Mongolian delegations have just concluded in a friendly, businesslike, and mutually trusting atmosphere. The two sides discussed all key areas of bilateral cooperation and exchanged views on current international political issues.
It is worth noting that His Excellency, Mr. President of Mongolia, and I reached a mutual understanding of all the issues we discussed. Acknowledging the importance of our cooperation for the two countries, we affirmed our shared commitment to strengthening Turkmen-Mongolian dialogue based on the principles of equality and mutual respect.
Our two countries will continue to cooperate in foreign policy to safeguard and strengthen global and regional peace and stability. Turkmenistan and Mongolia support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and will cooperate on environmental issues, food security, energy security, and transport connectivity. I expressed my gratitude to Mr. President for Mongolia’s support of Turkmenistan’s policy of permanent neutrality, efforts to ensure global security, and international initiatives aimed at fostering cooperation and promoting trust-based dialogue in interstate relations.
Turkmenistan highly values Mongolia’s constructive role and engagement on the global stage. We are confident that the cooperation between our two countries will have a substantial positive impact on improving the international situation and strengthening universally recognized norms of international law and the UN Charter. We also agreed to combine efforts in resolving global challenges and countering threats to international security, including combating terrorism, extremism, transnational crime, illicit drug trafficking, and other unlawful activities.
The official talks prioritized the trade and economic partnership between the two countries. The two sides discussed opportunities to synergize their efforts in establishing transport connectivity and collaborating on the development of transcontinental transport corridors from Asia to Europe. To that extent, I would like to highlight the significance of Turkmenistan’s “Revival of the Great Silk Road” initiative. We mutually acknowledged the existing prerequisites for establishing partnerships in energy and communications. Emphasizing the progress and prospects of trade was one of the key aspects of the official talks.
The two sides reached a mutual understanding of expanding and improving the volume of trade turnover between the two countries, as well as increasing the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises. In this context, several proposals were put forward by our side, which were received with high interest by the Mongolian side.
During the official talks, we discussed in detail the parliamentary cooperation, which could serve as a cornerstone of relations between Turkmenistan and Mongolia. We agreed to expand cooperation in culture, humanity, science, education, and sports.
The Turkmen delegation expressed deep satisfaction with the outcome of the official talks. Therefore, the two sides signed a pivotal package of bilateral cooperation documents. The first State Visit by the President of Turkmenistan to Mongolia was highly successful and is regarded as a crucial event in the history of friendly relations between our two countries and peoples.
Turkmenistan and Mongolia reiterated their sincere commitment to consistently and confidently developing long-term, friendly, equitable, and mutually beneficial relations.
Taking this opportunity, I extend my heartfelt wishes for peace and prosperity to the friendly people of Mongolia.
Thank you for your attention.”

President of Mongolia and Federal President of the Republic of Austria Hold a Press Briefing
At the invitation of President of Mongolia Khurelsukh Ukhnaa, Federal President of the Republic of Austria Alexander Van der Bellen is paying a State Visit to Mongolia on May 25-28, 2025. The two Heads of State held a press briefing on the outcomes of their official talks.
President of Mongolia Khurelsukh Ukhnaa:
“Your Excellency, Mr. Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen,
Representatives of the Press,
I extend my warm greetings to you all.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Federal President of the Republic of Austria Alexander Van der Bellen for accepting my invitation and paying a State Visit to our beautiful country of Mongolia, the land of the eternal blue skies. Mongolia and the Republic of Austria have enjoyed decades-long friendly relations.
Your Excellency, Mr. President, this is the first State Visit by the Head of State of Austria to Mongolia. This State Visit is of pivotal historical importance, opening a new chapter in the history of friendly relations and cooperation between our two peoples.
Austria was one of the first Western countries to recognize Mongolia’s independence and sovereignty and establish diplomatic relations more than 60 years ago. I am delighted to note that our friendly relations and cooperation have been actively expanding across numerous social and economic sectors based on shared democratic values of human rights, freedom, and the rule of law.
Austria is Mongolia’s “Third Neighbor” and a trusted partner in Europe, and Mongolia is committed to consistently expanding and developing our bilateral relations and cooperation in all areas. During your State Visit to Mongolia, we thoroughly discussed ways to consolidate the achievements of Mongolia-Austria relations over the past six decades, further expand our bilateral relations, and increase economic benefits and investments.
The Mongolian side proposed to invest in and cooperate on projects related to the development and construction of the cities of Kharkhorum and Khunnu, including building works, water supply and purification facilities, energy, and infrastructure. As an outcome of our official talks, we issued a “Mongolia-Austria Joint Declaration.” I am fully confident that this Joint Declaration, which sets future directions and defines the roadmap of our cooperation, will provide a crucial impetus to expanding bilateral relations between the two countries in all areas.
During the State Visit, we also signed legal documents aimed at further strengthening bilateral relations and cooperation. Notably, the signing of the “Agreement on Social Protection” establishes an important legal framework to ensure social security for citizens of the two countries, create favorable conditions for living and working, and enable individuals to receive pensions based on the periods during which they have paid social insurance contributions in either Mongolia or Austria. Furthermore, we concluded intergovernmental agreements on cooperation in innovation, technology, energy, mineral resources, economy, science, musical arts, and mutual exemption of visa requirements for holders of diplomatic passports. In addition, we agreed to conclude, in the near future, an Intergovernmental Agreement on International Road Transport, which will be of great importance for facilitating transport and increasing bilateral trade and economic relations.
We agreed to cooperate under Mongolia’s “Billions of Trees” National Movement and the European Union’s “Forest Partnership,” emphasizing that overcoming and addressing global challenges, including climate change, desertification, land degradation, and food security, is our common goal. Also, we exchanged views on implementing joint projects and programs to develop domestic production, support intensive livestock and farming, and introduce advanced technologies, under the “Food Supply and Security” and “White Gold” National Movements of Mongolia.
Your Excellency, Mr. Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen,
I would like to underscore that the health cooperation between Mongolia and Austria has expanded effectively and that the valuable contribution made by the Government of the Republic of Austria to the notable improvements in the quality of medical services provided to our citizens through the phased modernization of medical equipment at several healthcare institutions in Mongolia, such as the National Center for Maternal and Child Health, the National Cancer Treatment Center, the Central Military Hospital, and the Hospital of Mongolian National University of Medical Sciences.
We, the Mongols, consider the Republic of Austria the birthplace of classical music, the homeland of world-renowned composers, such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Franz Schubert, and the Strauss Family. I am pleased that during the State Visit, we agreed to deepen cooperation in culture, arts, and music and to facilitate academic and professional exchanges among educators, students, and researchers.
We pledged to deepen our relations and cooperation in tourism, education, science, and media and accelerate inter-university partnerships between our two countries, increase the number of Mongol students studying in Austria, and collaborate under the “President’s Scholarship-2100” Scholarship Program of Mongolia.
Mongolia and Austria have many similarities, such as geographical characteristics, climate, natural features, and foreign policy positions. Notably, our two countries maintain closely similar positions on key regional and international issues, including environmental protection, the promotion of sustainable development, the encouragement of eco-friendly lifestyles, and the development challenges faced by landlocked countries. We reaffirmed our mutual commitment to further strengthening bilateral cooperation within the United Nations and other international organizations.
We agreed to work together in preparation for the International Year of Rangelands and Pastoralists in 2026 and the 17th Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP17) to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which will be held in Ulaanbaatar. Moreover, the Mongolia-Austria Business Forum to be held during the State Visit will serve as a platform to foster closer ties between entrepreneurs and producers of our two countries and contribute to fostering mutually beneficial economic cooperation.
I am confident that the decisions we made during this State Visit will be implemented successfully, contributing to the development and prosperity of our two countries and the well-being of our two peoples, and that our relations and cooperation will continue to strengthen and expand further. I am convinced that Mongolia’s peace-loving, open, independent, and multi-pillar foreign policy, along with the shared values of Mongolia and Austria, such as democracy, human rights, freedom, and the rule of law, will contribute jointly to the noble cause of global peace, security, sustainable development, and the well-being of humanity. Your Excellency, Mr. Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen, esteemed guests, and delegates, I warmly welcome you to our beautiful country of Mongolia, the land of ancient history and eternal blue skies.
Thank you for your attention.”
Federal President of the Republic of Austria Alexander Van der Bellen:
“Your Excellency, President of Mongolia Khurelsukh Ukhnaa,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
First and foremost, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Your Excellency, President of Mongolia Khurelsukh Ukhnaa, for the invitation to pay a State Visit to Mongolia. I am truly delighted to be undertaking this State Visit to your country.
This State Visit marks the first Visit by the Head of State of the Republic of Austria to Mongolia, and it reflects the particular importance we attach to our relations with Mongolia. The Visit also stands as a testament to our recognition and appreciation of Mongolia’s path in embracing democracy and the rule of law over the past 30 years.
Although the beautiful country of Mongolia is geographically distant from us and situated in a geopolitically distinct and challenging environment, Austria and Mongolia share common values and ideals in political, social, and international community frameworks.
Today, the international community is facing notable challenges. In many parts of the world, tensions are escalating, and armed conflicts are unfolding, causing damage and suffering to innocent civilians. As we are in Europe, Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine concerns us the most. This not only threatens security but also our system of values that upholds freedom, democracy, and human rights.
We know well from our nation’s history that the existence of systems founded on the principles of democracy and respect for fundamental values is not guaranteed and that such systems are immensely precious and must be protected. That is why, in the current global context, it is more crucial than ever that we do not stand alone, but rather join forces with friends and like-minded partners to accelerate our cooperation. Only together, through close trade partnerships, strong diplomatic relations, and unyielding fundamental values, can we truly be stronger.
The pressing issues our world is facing today can only be resolved through collective efforts. This applies to all areas, from protecting our shared values and strengthening our security to stabilizing international trade flows and combating climate change. In this regard, I would like to underscore Mongolia’s policies and actions within the framework of the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, headquartered in Vienna. In particular, Mongolia’s active participation in UN peacekeeping missions stands out as a remarkable example and source of inspiration.
Our two countries have enjoyed close collaboration over many years under multilateral cooperation. At the same time, we have actively developed our bilateral cooperation. Numerous important agreements and a Mongolia-Austria Joint Declaration signed during this State Visit clearly reflect this progress, and I am truly pleased with it.
I would also like to highlight the scientific and cultural relations between Mongolia and the Republic of Austria. I am confident that our active and robust relations in these areas will be further consolidated during this State Visit. The presence of high-level representatives from these areas here in Mongolia presents an exceptional opportunity to boost our future collaboration even more.
In today’s rapidly advancing world, we must not overlook the importance of meeting and engaging in dialogue with one another. Cultural and scientific cooperation brings countries closer together and helps us embrace its benefits. Therefore, I encourage everyone to propose fruitful ideas and initiatives and engage in meaningful dialogue in this area.
Mongolia has achieved a great deal and has been full of accomplishments over the past 30 years. Your Excellency, Mr. President, I am convinced that your country has abundant resources and potential to achieve even greater success.
As a partner country, Austria is committed to walking alongside Mongolia on its path to success. We aspire to cooperate in all areas as a trade partner, a collaborator in international relations, and a supporter of research and science.
I feel assured that our bilateral cooperation will continue to expand and strengthen in the coming years. I hope this Visit to Mongolia will provide a weighty contribution to that end. Your Excellency, Mr. President, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude for the warm welcome, deep respect, and generous hospitality extended to us.
Thank you very much.”

Understanding Ethiopia’s low and falling tax-to-GDP ratio: key findings and lessons for other countries
Published:
Aug. 15, 2025
Vedanth Nair, David Phillips, Edris Seid, Ben Waltmann and Mulay Weldu Asegegehn.
The tax-to-GDP ratio of Ethiopia is low and has been persistently falling for more than a decade. This contrasts with the usual trend of a rising tax-to-GDP ratio as countries grow richer. Expanding formal sectors and increasing administrative capacity should, in theory, raise the fraction of national income that is collected in taxation. However, some countries with robust GDP growth have experienced falling tax-to-GDP ratios, such as Kenya, Rwanda and Indonesia. This trend has been particularly pronounced in Ethiopia.
This unusual trend should be analysed and reversed by addressing policy and administration gaps. The Ethiopian Ministry of Finance’s Tax Policy Department in collaboration with TaxDev have conducted a detailed analysis of Ethiopia’s tax-to-GDP ratio potential, the factors behind Ethiopia’s low tax-to-GDP ratio, and the factors behind the fall. The full report can be found
here
.
Between 2014/15 and 2022/23, Ethiopia’s tax-to-GDP ratio fell from 12.4% to just 7.5%, despite average annual GDP growth of 8%. The decline in the tax-to-GDP ratio has run counter to government and IMF forecasts, as shown by the graph below. The largest contributors to the decline were VAT, which declined by 2.4 percentage points of GDP, followed by trade taxes (1.1pp), corporate income tax (0.7 pp) and employment income taxes (0.3pp).
Figure 1. Ethiopia’s tax-to-GDP ratio, actual and forecast
So, why has Ethiopia’s tax-to-GDP ratio fallen?
The role of the public sector in tax collection
Much of the answer lies in the changing structure of Ethiopia’s economy, and the interaction of this with Ethiopia’s revenue collection system and tax structure.
Ethiopia’s high rate of economic growth in the early-to-mid-2010s was driven by investment. Especially important was state-backed investment in projects such as the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam and the Addis–Djibouti railway, as well as road, energy, irrigation and housing development projects. This investment boom has now largely come to an end. Investment as a share of GDP fell from 37% in 2015/16 to 22% in 2022/23, of which investment by the government and state-owned enterprises fell from 14% to 7% (in 2021/22), according to data from the World Bank.
Some of this investment flowed back into the government’s coffers in the form of higher tax revenues. VAT withholding was an important channel: all public sector entities in Ethiopia are required to withhold VAT on their purchases, effectively ensuring compliance among suppliers to the public sector. As public sector investment decreased, VAT compliance gaps widened – particularly in sectors like construction that were heavily reliant on public contracts. A major contributor to the decline in corporate income tax revenues was the decline in profitability of the state-owned Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, which was heavily involved in financing public sector investment. The decline in public sector spending relative to GDP also explains much of the fall in personal income tax revenues, given the relatively large share of PIT revenues paid by  public sector workers. This fall would have been steeper had personal income tax thresholds not been frozen in nominal terms.
While the continued strong growth in GDP suggests that private sector activity and consumption has taken the place of investment as an engine of growth, that has not translated into equivalent tax revenues –  because existing administrative systems are not as effective at collecting revenue directly from the private sector. In addition, our analysis suggests that a decline in tax compliance within the private sector has also contributed to the fall in Ethiopia’s tax to GDP ratio, on top of these more structural factors. That is particularly true for VAT and corporate income tax where lower compliance may explain half of the fall in revenues relative to GDP. And detailed sectoral data suggest that non-compliance is a particular issue in the construction, retail and wholesale sectors.
Falling imports and the overvaluation of the Birr
Another major economic shift is the decline in the ratio of imports to GDP, which led to an almost one-for-one decline in the ratio of import tax revenues to GDP. The decline in imports is partly linked to lower public sector investment: a large share of Ethiopia’s imports during the investment boom were capital goods used in infrastructure projects.
The overvaluation of the Birr also contributed to the decline in the ratio of import tax revenues to GDP, especially from 2021 onwards. It did this by depressing the value of imports and hence import taxes in Birr, relative to the value of domestically produced goods and services that make up GDP. Defending the overvalued Birr also required rationing the use of foreign currencies and hence imports, further reducing import tax revenues. Ethiopia’s 2024 currency devaluation (announced after our report was substantively complete) has started to reverse the decline in import tax revenues: real-terms customs duty revenues in the nine months from July 2024 were double those recorded in the nine months from July 2023.
Other potential factors
The report also considers the role of several other factors in explaining the fall in Ethiopia’s tax-to-GDP ratio.
Recent changes in tax policy do not appear to have contributed significantly to the fall in tax revenues. There were no major revenue-reducing policy reforms during this period. High profile VAT exemptions on selected food items brought in to address cost-of-living pressures are estimated to have cost less than 0.1% of GDP. Some long-standing choices, such as not collecting VAT and excises on fuel, help explain why Ethiopia’s tax-to-GDP ratio is lower than in many other comparable countries, but not the recent decline.
The report also investigated the possibility that the measured tax-to-GDP ratio has fallen, in part, because GDP growth has been overestimated. Reported GDP growth has been very high in Ethiopia and much higher than GDP growth as predicted by two alternative measures of economic activity: urban employment earnings and night-time lights as measured by a satellite. But these alternative measures of GDP growth have serious shortcomings, and a third alternative measure of GDP, aggregate consumption as recorded in the Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey, is entirely consistent with reported GDP growth. With this mixed evidence, it is not possible to definitively conclude that over-estimation of GDP growth means that the fall in the tax-to-GDP has been overstated.
Lessons for other countries
What might other countries learn from both Ethiopia’s experience and the methods used in our joint study?
First, tax-to-GDP ratios can be vulnerable when revenues are highly reliant on a relatively narrow set of economic activities, especially if administrative capacity to tax other activities is not well developed. Ethiopia has been heavily reliant on the relatively easier-to-tax public sector and imports for its tax revenues. As these parts of the economy have shrunk relative to GDP, so too has Ethiopia’s tax-to-GDP ratio. In other countries, it could be extractives or the finance sector that there is a particular reliance on. Sustainably raising the tax-to-GDP ratio requires a diversified tax base, and effective collection and enforcement mechanisms across the economy.
Second, trade, exchange rate and financial policies can have significant effects on tax revenue. Addressing over-valued currencies and reducing restrictions on foreign exchange transactions and capital flows are not painless but can generate revenues, sometimes rapidly.
Turning to lessons from our analytical approach, it is important to recognise that understanding why a country’s tax-to-GDP ratio is declining or stagnating is rarely straightforward. There is no one-size-fits-all methodology. But one general lesson is the value of combining data from a range of sources - particularly tax microdata - with close attention to the specific features of the country’s economy and tax system.
In Ethiopia, VAT gap analysis – using a version of the IMF’s RA-GAP method adapted to the country context – underpinned the analysis of the decline in the VAT-to-GDP ratio. The findings, together with tax microdata on VAT withholding, pointed to a link between public sector investment and VAT compliance.
Although the link between the decline in import tax revenues and value of imports was clear, the underlying reasons for the drop in the value of imports were less so. Customs microdata was used to break down the decline into the change in the volume of imports and changes in the prices of imported goods (relative to domestically produced goods). This allowed for the role of changes in import demand and the overvaluation of the Birr to be better understood. Comparing import values with the value of exports by trade partners recorded in the UN Comtrade database helped rule out the hypothesis that the undervaluation of imports by traders was a contributor to the decline in measured import values and tax revenues.
For the corporate income tax, a full-blown CIT gap analysis was not possible due to data limitations. However, comparing changes in each sector’s contribution to GDP with its revenue contributions pointed to potential changes in compliance. Data from the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia’s annual reports allowed for the fall in the bank’s corporate income tax contributions to be linked to public sector investment. Household survey data was used to understand the factors underlying trends in personal income tax revenues, as well as to examine how official measures of GDP growth compared to changes in consumption and wages.
Country-specific knowledge provided by our partners at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance and other parts of the Government of Ethiopia was also vital. It helped to guide the analysis, develop hypotheses, and interpret the data.
This detailed, country-specific analysis can generate insights that higher-level approaches cannot. A large body of research has sought to model countries’ potential tax-to-GDP ratios based on broad economic indicators like income levels or trade flows. In Ethiopia’s case, such models suggested that the decline in the tax-to-GDP ratio could not be explained by changes in economic structure. However, the tax microdata told a different story: changes in the structure of the economy clearly mattered. The disconnect arises because cross-country models do not fully account for country-specific factors – in Ethiopia’s case, its traditional reliance on the public sector for tax revenue , including through the tax withholding system, and relatively weaker capacity to collect revenues directly from the private sector.
The greater availability of tax microdata – which has improved substantially in Ethiopia – and diagnostic tools such as VAT gap modelling makes this type of analysis more possible. In Ethiopia, there is still more work that can be done. In particular, further analysis is needed to understand why compliance with VAT and corporate income tax declined beyond what can be explained by changes in the structure of the economy. And other countries – particularly those also facing stagnant or falling tax-to-GDP ratios – should consider undertaking their own detailed analysis of the underlying causes.

After years of conflict, Building Bridges to Education: The Critical Role of Teachers’ Housing in Boosting School Enrollment and Quality in Post-Conflict Adaa’r
Published:
July 2, 2025
In the aftermath of conflict, rebuilding essential infrastructure becomes paramount to restoring normalcy and fostering sustainable development in target regions of the Response-Recovery-Resilience for Conflict-Affected Communities in Ethiopia Project (3R4CACE). In Adaa’r district of Ethiopia’s Afar region, the devastating impact of the northern conflict left schools in ruins, displaced teachers, and severely hindered access to quality education. Recognizing that education is a fundamental pillar for community recovery and future prosperity, the Response-Recovery-Resilience for Conflict-Affected Communities in Ethiopia Project (3R4CACE), supported by the World Bank Group and implemented by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the Ministry of Women and Social Affairs (MoWSA), has prioritized not just repairing physical infrastructure, but also addressing the critical human resource challenges that impede educational progress. As part of its comprehensive approach, the project is also supporting the reconstruction and rehabilitation of school buildings across the region, ensuring safer and more conducive learning environments for children.
A key initiative within this project has been the construction of teachers’ housing at three schools, alongside the repair of four educational facilities. This strategic focus on teachers’ accommodation addresses a crucial barrier—long distances teachers previously traveled, sometimes up to 15 kilometers, which often resulted in tardiness, fatigue, and in some cases, absenteeism. By providing on-site housing, the project has significantly improved teachers’ attendance and dedication, thereby enhancing the overall quality of education delivered by the government.
One teacher at the school expressed their gratitude for the positive changes, noting that they are "thankful" to now live and teach within the community, no longer burdened by long, exhausting commutes. The provision of essential educational materials, such as desks and storybooks, has also been highly valued by the education sector, contributing significantly to improving the learning environment. These successes highlight the effectiveness of the Community Driven Development (CDD) approach, which empowers local communities to identify their own needs and implement projects that directly enhance access to education and basic services like clean water, thereby rebuilding vital community assets.
The tangible impact of these interventions is evident in the remarkable increase in student enrollment—from approximately 4,000 students in 2016 EC to around 5,500 in the current year, according to Mr. Ali Keyta Ahmed, head of the Adaa’r district education office. He added that “This surge underscores how infrastructure improvements, particularly teachers’ housing, directly influence enrollment rates by creating a more inviting and accessible learning environment. Moreover, the presence of teachers living on school grounds fosters stronger relationships with students and the community, further encouraging families to send their children to school.”
Mr. Ali Keyta Ahmed emphasizes that the project’s success lies in its holistic approach. Unlike many initiatives that focus solely on physical infrastructure, the 3R4CACE recognizes that supporting teachers— especially through adequate housing—serves as a cornerstone for quality education. This approach not only attracts and retains qualified educators but also ensures they are well-rested, motivated, and committed, ultimately translating into improved learning outcomes.
Stories from community members, such as Mr. Mohammed Alikolaile, highlight the profound personal and communal benefits of these efforts. Mr. Mohammed notes that children now have access to nearby schools, enabling them to pursue their education without the hardships of long commutes, and fostering hope for a brighter future.
The construction of teachers’ housing within the 3R4CACE project exemplifies how targeted infrastructure investments—especially those supporting teachers—are vital for increasing school enrollment and elevating the quality of education in post-conflict settings. By rebuilding not only physical structures but also the capacity of human resources, the project is laying the foundation for resilient, inclusive, and sustainable educational systems that can transform communities like Adaa’r for generations to come.

Hope Rises from the Ashes: How a Health Center Project United Two Warring Communities
Published:

Meket is one of the woredas located on the western side of the Semien Wollo Zone in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. In the heart of Meket’s district, two communities, 07 Defergie and 08 Arebal, were locked in a bitter rivalry. Years of raids, blood feuds, and deep social divisions had driven a wedge between them, making even basic interactions dangerous. This animosity reached a boiling point during the recent conflict in northern Ethiopia, which left both communities devastated and struggling to rebuild. Both communities lost basic water, educational and health facilities due to the conflict. Amidst the ruins, a glimmer of hope emerged through the Response-Recovery-Resilience for Conflict-Affected Communities in Ethiopia Project (3R4CACE), which is a multifaceted initiative aimed at supporting communities impacted by conflict in Ethiopia. The 3R4CACE project targets five regions and close to 50 woredas in Afar, Amhara, Benishangul-Gumuz, Oromia and Tigray that were most affected by conflict, including the two communities, 07 Defergie and 08 Arebal in Amhara region.  The selection process aims to ensure the project effectively addresses the needs of conflict-affected communities while promoting sustainability and resilience.
However, this project, designed to bring much-needed healthcare to the two communities, among others, faced a monumental challenge: the deeply ingrained distrust between the two communities. Initially, in consultation with community members the 3R4CACE project at the local level proposed building a shared facility in a central location based on the available budget. This seemingly practical solution was immediately rejected by both groups. They didn’t want to share common facility whether health or educational. The project coordinator, Mesay Belay noted that “Fear and resentment ran so deep that they preferred smaller, less-equipped health centers, even if it meant fewer resources, rather than sharing a space”.
The project team recognized the necessity of bridging the chasm of distrust in order to deliver healthcare to these vulnerable communities. It was a formidable challenge that demanded months of painstaking effort. They went door-to-door, engaging in numerous discussions and consultations with community members. Throughout these interactions, they listened to harrowing stories of theft, violence, and the pervasive daily fear. The project team understood that the health center was not merely about bricks and mortar; it was about healing deep-seated wounds within the community.
Recognizing the need for a broader approach, they enlisted the help of respected figures within the communities, particularly religious leaders. These individuals, wielding the power of faith and tradition, helped facilitate dialogues that emphasized shared values and a common identity as Ethiopians. The message of forgiveness and unity gradually began to resonate. Community members, weary from years of conflict, started to see the project as an opportunity to break free from the cycle of pain and division.
The turning point came when the communities, through their own initiative, held a series of community meetings. They bravely confronted their shared history, acknowledging the pain and suffering they had inflicted upon each other. In these gatherings, a remarkable transformation occurred. Former adversaries started sharing meals, engaging in traditional customs, and rediscovering the bonds that had been severed. The health center project, once a source of contention, evolved into a symbol of reconciliation.
The communities, in a powerful display of unity, drafted a letter addressed to the district council, expressing their newfound commitment to the shared health center. This document, signed by numerous community members, served as a testament to their collective will to heal and move forward.
Today, through the 3R4CACE Project, the construction of the shared health center is underway, a testament to the transformative power of dialogue and the resilience of the human spirit. The communities, once divided by fear and resentment, are now united by a shared vision for a healthier and more peaceful future. What started as a health infrastructure project has become a beacon of hope, demonstrating that even the deepest wounds can be healed when communities choose compassion and collaboration over conflict.

Ethiopia and Development Partners Relaunch Public Financial Management Reforms to Strengthen Transparency and Fiscal Accountability
Published:
Nov. 19, 2025
November 19, 2025 - ADDIS ABABA —
The Ministry of Finance on Wednesday convened a high-level meeting of the Public Financial Management (PFM) Joint Working Group, reaffirming Ethiopia’s commitment to strengthening transparency, accountability, and fiscal governance. Senior government officials outlined key reforms to improve budgeting, cash management, procurement, and public investment oversight. Development partners, including the World Bank, IMF, EU, AfDB, Gates Foundation, UNICEF, and UNDP, attended in a supportive role, providing technical and financial assistance to bolster the government-led agenda.
State Minister H.E. Semereta Sewasew stressed that Public Financial Management reforms are “a strategic pillar for Ethiopia’s recovery and long-term growth,” emphasizing that they reshape how the country plans, allocates, spends, and monitors public resources. She highlighted Ethiopia’s focus on credible budgeting, realistic revenue projections, and establishing a multi-year expenditure framework to ensure fiscal discipline and safeguard essential services for citizens.
The meeting also highlighted the acceleration of a unified Treasury Single Account, integrating federal and regional accounts with weekly cash planning to ensure predictable fund flows. These reforms aim to increase efficiency and help ensure that resources reach schools, hospitals, roads, and other critical public services.
The Government is continuing to strengthen Public Financial Management systems across all levels—including in the regions—to enhance transparency, accountability, and efficiency. The meeting also reviewed oversight of public investment and state-owned enterprises. Regular financial reporting, independent review of large projects, and integrating fiscal risk statements into the national budget are critical to managing debt risks and ensuring borrowing remains sustainable, protecting the economy and safeguarding public finances.
Digitalization is a key focus, with significant progress in modernizing the IFMIS system to improve transparency and efficiency in budget execution, procurement, payroll, and payments, including a shift to electronic payments to reduce leakages.

ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA – October 28, 2025
– The Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the European Union (EU) have signed a €90 million financing agreement for the Annual Action Plan (AAP)-2025. This agreement acknowledges Ethiopia’s unique context, specifically the ongoing deep economic reforms and its post-conflict recovery and reconstruction needs.
The agreement was formalized today in Addis Ababa and signed by H.E. Semereta Sewasew, State Minister at the Ministry of Finance, and H.E. Sofie From-Emmesberger, EU Ambassador to Ethiopia. This €90 million initiative marks a renewed phase of cooperation between the two parties.
H.E. Semereta Sewasew highlighted the profound significance of the financing agreement and its role in the bilateral relationship highlighting that “the initiative carries both symbolic and strategic value, representing another milestone in the long-standing partnership between Ethiopia and the European Union, rooted in shared history and sustained by mutual cooperation”.
She further noted that the EU and its Member States, as one of Ethiopia’s major and long-standing development partners, offer vast potential to further expand this relationship. By leveraging the Multiannual Indicative Programme (MIP) and the Global Gateway Initiative, and working closely under the Team Europe approach, she stated that: “we can unlock new investment opportunities and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes”.
The programs under AAP-2025 are designed to complement key national initiatives, aligning well with the Government of Ethiopia’s priorities. The plan is implemented through the "Team Europe" approach.
H.E. Sofie From-Emmesberger stated that “Through the “Team Europe” approach, the Annual Action Plan (AAP) aligns with Ethiopia’s Home-Grown Economic Reform Agenda while contributing to the broader Global Gateway Strategy. It emphasises pivotal initiatives such as, strengthening land governance, enhancing nature conservation, empowering women, and supporting migrant integration—each vital to ensuring sustainable development”.
The AAP-2025 aligns with Ethiopia’s Green Legacy Initiative, which promotes biodiversity conservation and the building of a climate resilient green economy.
Alongside the signing of the financing agreement, a Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) took place with European businesses operating in Ethiopia. The objectives of the dialogue included addressing challenges faced in the business environment, such as customs and taxation matters, investment protection, legal predictability, land leases, and coordination among government agencies.
Ethiopian Investment Commissioner, H. E. Dr. Zeleke Temesgen, noted that the PPD helped to identify and address bottlenecks faced by European businesses, enhance the investment climate and chart new avenues of cooperation. He added that establishing a consistent framework for dialogue between the Ethiopian government and EU businesses is deemed essential to track the progress of agreed actions and ensure ongoing engagement.
The EU Delegation to Ethiopia expressed gratitude for the collaborative efforts of Ethiopian ministries, agencies, implementing partners, and dedicated EU Delegation and Member State teams in preparing the Annual Action Plan.

Turning Vision into Action: UNFPA and UNDP Strengthen Partnership to Drive Ethiopia’s Sustainable Future

Addis Ababa, Ethiopia — 27 October 2025:
The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance (MoF), today jointly launched their new Country Programmes, which will be implemented during the period 2025–2030.
The joint launch underscores a renewed commitment to advancing Ethiopia’s national development agenda. Firmly anchored in the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework and aligned with the Government of Ethiopia’s Ten-Year Development Plan and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Country Programmes will focus on several key areas: strengthening human capital development, advancing gender equality, addressing geographical disparities, promoting resilience, and ensuring that no one is left behind.
Speaking on the occasion, H.E. Semereta Sewasew, State Minister of Finance for Economic Cooperation, stated that the event is a crucial testament to the strong partnership between the government and the agencies. She also ascertained that “the new country programs are designed in alignment with Ethiopia’s 10-year development plan and the Home-Grown Economic Reform 2.0’ which is a testament to our deep collaboration with the UN system in making contributions for the national and international development commitments.”
The Government of Ethiopia remains committed to inclusive and sustainable development for all, achieved through macroeconomic reforms and effective management of the global aid system. She further noted that ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services, advancing gender equality, and ending harmful practices are integral to this vision. Empowering women and girls and protecting their rights are characterized as both a moral duty and a key driver of Ethiopia’s sustainable, peaceful, and prosperous future.
UNFPA’s Country Programme is guided by its mission of “Delivering a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person’s potential is fulfilled”. The programme will focus on achieving the
Three Plus One (3+1) strategic pillars
: ending preventable maternal deaths; ending unmet need for family planning; ending gender-based violence (GBV) and harmful practices against women and girls; and ending the sexual transmission of HIV infections.
Mr. Koffi Kouame, UNFPA Country Representative, stated that UNFPA, in its new Country Programme, will support the Government and partners to strengthen systems, institutions, and communities to deliver high-quality, comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services, maternal health, as well as essential services to address gender-based violence and harmful practices. Mr. Kouame added that their focus is on
evidence-driven interventions, equitable access, and survivor-centred care
to ensure that every woman and girl can be safe and live with dignity and free from harm. UNFPA's 10th Country Programme aims to reach selected districts in ten regions and one city administration in Ethiopia. During the implementation period until June 2030, the programme targets more than 21 million women and young people with rights-based life-saving sexual and reproductive health information and services.
At the same time, UNDP’s Country Programme with an estimated budget of $279.3 m will emphasize three key areas:
Strengthening governance and accelerating inclusive economic growth.
Advancing climate resilience.
Promoting innovation and gender equality.
Mr. Samuel Doe, UNDP Resident Representative, outlined that while maintaining its three core programme pillars, UNDP will continue to build on flagship initiatives such as the world’s largest demobilisation and reintegration programme, and a milestone national dialogue, and will maintain core support areas, including electoral assistance. He noted that this new programme is designed to respond to emerging needs and opportunities. Mr. Doe added that UNDP aims to increasingly harness the catalytic power of innovation and artificial intelligence to scale up solutions in climate action, governance expansion, and job creation—particularly for youth and women.

Washington, D.C. – The Minister of Finance of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, H.E. Ahmed Shide, and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) convened a high-level meeting on the sidelines of the IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings, to explore and advance financing cooperation for a new international airport project designed to support Ethiopia’s expanding aviation sector and broader economic development goals.

The proposed project is expected to significantly expand passenger and cargo capacity, ease congestion at Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, and serve as a key logistics hub for the Horn of Africa.
DFC expressed strong interest in supporting the project through potential financing, investment guarantees, and partnerships with U.S. private sector firms in airport development, supply, engineering, and construction.
“We welcome DFC’s engagement in Ethiopia’s transport infrastructure, particularly in the aviation sector, which is critical to our national development and regional competitiveness,” said H.E. Ahmed Shide, Ethiopia’s Minister of Finance. “This meeting marks an important step in building strong partnerships that deliver long-term benefits for our people and economy.”
Both parties agreed to continue discussions to develop a viable financing structure for the new international airport.
The meeting underscored the shared vision of a robust partnership that leverages U.S. financing to drive Ethiopia’s economic transformation. Discussions also covered ongoing and future projects, with a mutual interest in scaling up investments that deliver measurable community and economic benefits.
This engagement builds on DFC’s broader strategy in Africa, which focuses on strengthening partnerships with key governments to catalyze high-impact investments, unlocking private capital flows, and expanding access to critical infrastructure and essential services.

The Ministry of Finance of Ethiopia and Ethiopian Communications Authority Welcome the Award of New Telecommunication Licenses to the Global Partnership for Ethiopia
Addis Ababa, 22 May 2021
– The Ministry of Finance and the Ethiopian Communications Authority warmly welcome the award of one new telecommunication license to the Global Partnership for Ethiopia a private consortium of Safaricom (Kenya), Vodafone Group (UK), Vodacom Group (South Africa), CDC Group (UK), & Sumitomo Corporation (Japan), and Development Finance Cooperation (DFC) today, reflecting a major external investment into Ethiopia and its telecommunications market and an end to a decades-long state monopoly.
« Today marks a decisive day for our economic reform path in Ethiopia. With the liberalization of the telecom market through a fair and transparent process, the government enables every Ethiopian to access quality services at an affordable price”, said Finance Minister Ahmed Shide upon the announcement.
The selection of one winner completes a transparent process which began in October 2020 to open Ethiopia’s telecom market to operators beyond Ethio Telecom, the publicly-owned national telecom company. At the end of April 2021, the Ethiopian Communication Authority announced that two consortia had submitted proposals: a consortium of Safaricom (Kenya), Vodafone Group (UK), Vodacom Group (South Africa), CDC Group (UK), & Sumitomo Corporation (Japan), and Development Finance Cooperation (DFC) and the South African telecommunications giant MTN Group Limited, supported by Silk Road Fund, a Chinese investment fund.
Subsequent to the announcement of the decision by the Government of Ethiopia, ECA director general, Eng. Balcha Reba said “This decision ushers in a new era of telecom service development in our country which will benefit millions of Ethiopians to have access to quality and reliable communications services. Global Partnership for Ethiopia is a consortium of reputable telecom companies providing service to over 750 million customers all over the world and committed to create new jobs, support the economy through introduction of new and efficient services. I am also very pleased the consortium will invest 8 billion USD over the next ten years”.

The Governments of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and the French Republic, in partnership with the European Union, major European corporations, and financial institutions, are convening in Paris on 3 November 2025 for a landmark investment forum. The event seeks to unlock new avenues of collaboration and investment across four strategic sectors—aviation, renewable energy, transport and logistics, and digital innovation including AI and telecommunications. It stands as a testament to the growing economic partnership between Ethiopia and Europe, envisioned to catalyze sustainable growth and technological transformation.
Emphasizing Ethiopia’s remarkable economic progress, H.E. Dr. Gedeon Timotheos, Minister of Foreign Affairs, described the Forum as a defining moment in advancing innovation, infrastructure, and inclusive development. H.E. Ahmed Shide, Minister of Finance, highlighted Ethiopia’s ongoing transition toward a liberalized and competitive economy, guided by the Home-Grown Economic Reform Agenda and the Ten-Year Development Plan, where European private investment is seen as pivotal. Similarly, Mr. Philippe Gautier, CEO of MEDEF International, underscored Europe’s recognition of Ethiopia’s vast potential as a dynamic economy and emerging partner in building sustainable, digital, and green infrastructure. The Forum’s discussions will center on transformative projects such as the Bishoftu Airport and Logistics Hub, renewable energy initiatives, the Special Economic Zone, and nationwide digital transformation driven by Ethiopia’s vibrant and tech-savvy youth.
With a population exceeding 130 million and consistent GDP growth above 6%, Ethiopia stands among Africa’s most attractive destinations for investment. Ongoing structural reforms—including the liberalization of state-owned enterprises and the strengthening of industrial and agricultural value chains—are reshaping the investment landscape and opening new frontiers for European engagement. The Forum thus provides a timely platform for participants to gain first-hand insights into Ethiopia’s evolving business environment, explore joint ventures, identify viable investment pipelines, and assess financing opportunities under the Team Europe and Global Gateway frameworks.

Integrated Landscape Management To Enhance Food Security And Ecosystem Resilience In Ethiopia
Integrated Watershed Management to Enhance Food Security and Ecosystem Resilience in Ethiopia
1. Background
Integrated Watershed Management to enhance food security and ecosystem resilience in Ethiopia is a five-year project (2017-2022) being implemented in 12 woredas/districts of 6 regions of the country:1. Angolela and Menze-Gera woredas in Amhara region, 2. Tanqua-Abergele and Raya-Azebo woredas inTigray region, 3. Chiro and Doba woredas in Oromia region, 4. Belela and Dugna- Fango woredas in SNNP region, 5. Aba’ala and Amibara woredas in Afar region and 6. Tuliguled and Gursum woredas in Somali region.
1. Project objective
To enhance long-term sustainability and resilience of food production systems by addressing the environmental drivers of food insecurity in Ethiopia. The overarching focus is on integrated landscape management (ILM) to achieve food production resilience in landscapes under pressure. ILM combines land management choices and Integrated Natural Resources Management (INRM) with water- and climate-smart agriculture, value chain support and gender responsiveness.
This project contributes to:
 LD Objective 3 (Reduce pressures on natural resources by managing competing land uses in broader landscapes),
 Program 4 (Scaling-up sustainable land management through the Landscape Approach). This objective and program seek a range of outcomes increased investments in SLM and support mechanisms for SLM in wider landscapes as well as the adoption by local communities of integrated landscape management practices
2. Project Outcomes
Component 1: Institutional frameworks for enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem goods and services within food production systems
Major Activities:
 Functioning multi-stakeholder platforms in place in the project sites and related levels of local government
 Application of one gender-sensitive decision-support tool and participatory process
 Strengthening environmental school clubes
 In place policies at national and local level to support smallholder agriculture and food value-chains
Component 2: Scaling up the Integrated Landscape Management approach to achieve improved productivity of smallholder food production systems and innovative transformations to non-farm livelihoods
Activities:
 Implementation of Integrated Land Management and supporting significant biodiversity and the goods and services
 Support an increase in production of nutrient-dense foods (vegetables, fruits, legumes and animal-source foods)
 Encourage more integrated farming systems
 Establish alternative livelihood options and better access to microfinance
 Support in the modernization of extension services with ‘champion’ farmer approaches, farmer field schools and innovation
 Support Agro-pastoral systems under integrated landscape management
 Support households with increased access to food including through off-farm activities
 Support to increase investment flows to integrated natural resources management
Component 3: Knowledge Management, Learning, Monitoring and Assessment
Major Activities:
 Establish Multi-scale monitoring of ecosystem services and global environmental benefits established at landscape level
 Involve local academic and research institutions & selected farmers/pastoralists to establish an action research and learning program to provide evidence and support for local innovation and flexibility to
support the adoption of approaches
3. Total Budget and source of finance
The total project budget is USD 10,739,450 both from the GEF and UNDP sources. Furthermore, there is co- financing agreement in kind from the government of the country estimated as USD 14,465,431.
4. Key project achievements by the end of 2018
Under the project interventions, 55,540 hhs (28,933men and 26,607 women) have been benefited through diversified and integrated landscape management and food security interventions. The project has been working within 58 communities in 24,608.4ha through provision of selected agricultural inputs and technologies to improve the agricultural productivity, enhance livelihoods and ensure sustainability. These include supporting them in developing agricultural value chains, food security, working on nutrition sensitive agriculture, rehabilitation of degraded farm lands through appropriate technologies, soil fertility management, small scale irrigation, and related climate smart agricultural development technologies.
Rehabilitation of degraded landscape was one of the major components of the project; as the result 19,139.58 ha of land has been rehabilitated through appropriate technologies including physical & biological soil and water conservation, plantation, area closure management. The project provided dense food crop seeds and related inputs, improved dairy heifers, small ruminates, poultry, capacity building training and related inputs. Gender mainstreaming is also an important part of the project engaging women in all the project activities including in Climate Smart Income Generation Activities (IGA) such as poultry, fuel saving cooking stove production, solar energy, biogas development, horticulture and vegetable farming.
Furthermore, the project organized landless pro-poor families to engage themselves in feasible off-farm income generating activities. As the result 116 SHG with a member of 2748(74% women) have been organized and linked to micro finance institutions for further partnership and support. The project supported SHG through training, linking them to the credit and saving institutions. Accordingly, the SHG accumulated and saved birr 368,899.90 for further business development. Need based and knowledge supported integrated land scape management and food security programmes can solve the prevailing land degradation problems and climate change related food insecurity in the poor farming communities. To this effect the project identified key project deliverable areas and hired consultants to identify the existing opportunities, challenges and way forwards.
As the result, the project accomplished 7 studies.

TITLE: PCB Management in Ethiopia Project

Environmental Regulatory
PCB Management in Ethiopia Project
PCB Management in Ethiopia Project
1. Background
Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a group of man-made   organic compounds that are resistant to environmental degradation through Chemical, Biological, and Photolytic processes. For this reason, they remain intact in the environment for a long time; become widely distributed throughout the environment; accumulate in fatty tissue of living organisms; and are toxic to humans and wildlife. The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) counts Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) among the most toxic and persistent chemicals listed in the convention to be eliminated worldwide by 2025. Although PCBs were mostly used in closed systems, like transformers and capacitors, very often such equipment is recycled at the end of their operational life and the PCB oil contained therein can be either directly wasted in the environment, recycled, or even sold as fuel oil. Aware of the adverse human health and environmental impacts of POPs, both at the national and global levels and the need for concerted action to address such impacts, Ethiopia is among one of the countries who took the commitment Stockholm in the convention.
Prior to the onset of the PCB project, the result of the preliminary PCB inventory in Ethiopia indicates that a comprehensive inventory will need to be conducted on all potentially PCB-containing electrical equipment in the Ethiopian electric power and electric utility system. Due to absence of data either on the nameplate or equipment manual, PCB concentrations have not been determined or characterized. Therefore, the lack of adequate national data on PCBs, the potential for significant PCB releases from their use, stockpiles and wastes, and the need to phase out and dispose of PCBs and equipment are major problems that have been prioritized for action.
This GEF-funded PCB management project in Ethiopia to meet the 2025 Stockholm Convention deadline is one of the key responses to the NIP by the Ethiopian government. In collaboration with UNDP, an implementing agency of the GEF, the project intends to provide Ethiopia with the necessary technical and financial support required to ensure that all the PCBs in the country are identified and disposed of. The identification and disposal of PCBs will result in health risk reduction associated with PCBs. This will lead to improved health and well-being of the people and contribute to sustainable development.
As the then (preparation of the project) inventory from the National Implementation Plan (NIP) was not sufficiently detailed to plan a full-size project, the project is designed to either confirm the lower bracket in terms of amount of PCBs in the country, and fully address the PCB issue in Ethiopia as part of this Phase 1 project; or identify additional PCBs thus justifying a phase 2 follow-up PCB project. The present project will include the identification and disposal of 150 t of PCB-contaminated equipment and waste.
2.
Project Objective
Overall objective
: strengthening capacity of national stakeholders to manage PCB as well as to achieve its elimination.
Specific objective
: identification and disposal of 150 t of PCB-contaminated equipment and waste
3. Project Budget
Total budget USD 1,990,000 plus USD 150K UNDP- core funding.
4. Project Duration
The project has four years + 1 year no cost extension
5. Partnerships:-
The project will be implemented in partnership with the relevant institutional and industrial partners, i.e. Environmental Protection Authority, Ethiopian Electric Power, Ethiopian Electric Utility, Ethio-engineering Group, Ethiopian Conformity Assessment Enterprise (ECAE) other potential holders of PCB equipment, and other interested and affected stakeholders. Each one of these partners will play a specific role in ensuring that the changes needed for the project implementation are achieved.
6. Project Component
Component 1
:
Strengthening of legal frameworks, administrative processes and technical preparedness for the sound management of P
CBs
in Ethiopia
This component will support Ethiopia to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the national and institutional legal framework, key stakeholders, and gaps and overlaps, and to prioritize needs. After the comprehensive review and assessment, a decision will be made to draft new legislation specifically on PCBs or to strengthen the existing ones with inclusion of PCB-specific provisions. The assessment will also address institutional capacity and arrangements for the management of PCB, and gaps and overlaps will be identified and addressed through consultation and coordination processes. In addition to the legal instruments to be put in place for PCB management and disposal, a national PCB tracking system to prevent illegal importation of equipment likely to contain PCBs will be developed. This will involve periodic technical visits to the PCB holders, which will provide technical support and advice to purchase PCB-free transformers, capacitors, and related equipment; and preventing exports of suspected PCB-containing transformers. As part of the actions to prevent PCB-related accidents, the current chemical response procedures and mechanisms will be strengthened and piloted.
Internal guidelines and procedures targeted for utility companies and step-by-step approaches for those working with equipment and oil likely to contain PCBs will be developed and training provided for all the affected workers. The utility companies will be requested to sign off on these guidelines and procedures to confirm their commitment.
Component 2: Review and strengthening of national capacity for PCB management throughout the lifecycle
This component will support Ethiopia to review and strengthen data collection and management capacity, as well as to develop detailed PCB management plans at the facility level. A comprehensive PCB training programme will take place, covering PCB inventories, analysis, prioritization, and development of management plans.
The inventory database will also provide a platform for characterisation of PCB waste streams. This characterization will then facilitate a feasibility study of using cost effective, technologically robust, and available technologies to promote environmentally sound management and disposal of PCBs. About 33,000 pieces of transformers and capacitors will be inventoried covering all 10 regions of Ethiopia. The outcomes of the feasibility study will form a basis for the development of PCB management plans.
Furthermore, this component will result in improved generation/collection of data, information, and monitoring of PCBs providing solid support to sound decision-making and planning process for ESM of PCBs. Comprehensive guidance on operation and maintenance of PCB-contaminated equipment, identification and labelling procedures, handling, transportation, temporary storage, and disposal will be developed.
Additionally, a national PCB management plan will be developed and tested at the national and facility levels. The national PCB tracking system will also be tested. Training will be provided at the beginning of the implementation of each activity.
Under this component, an awareness raising strategy will also be developed, awareness materials such as brochures, project cards, meeting banners and posters, for different target groups, will be developed and disseminated at the different levels – communities, technicians and policy-makers. Media briefing events both at mid-level managers (facility managers) and high-level (ministers, members of parliament and chief executives) will be planned and executed. Furthermore, local communities will have access to awareness raising materials in their own local languages and trainings for the community leaders will be organized. All these efforts will be geared towards ensuring that there is better understanding of the problem and ensure protection of the population and the environment from adverse effects of PCBs. The awareness raising will also contribute to generating political support for the project.
Component 3
:
ESM of PCBs liquids and equipment in use or out of service
This component will minimize and to a greater degree eliminate the risk of adverse effects of PCBs in the population and the environment. The database information will provide the required information to characterize the PCB waste streams and concentrations in the various matrices where PCBs are found. PCB-containing transformers and capacitors will be collected and transported to four central temporary storage facilities. Based on waste characterization outcomes, management and disposal options will be evaluated. The project will establish priorities according to the conditions of the PCB stocks and to the location. In that sense, the PCB management plans, developed in the previous project component, will guide facilities in their maintenance and disposal operations. The evaluation of disposal options will take into account the levels of PCB concentrations and the condition of the equipment. To reduce costs, a dechlorination approach will be explored. For example, the treatment or disposal of contaminated transformers which are relatively new and in good working order might only require a dechlorination approach – whereas old, defective and highly contaminated transformers in low- or high-risk areas might require a different approach. These types of transformers and capacitors will be considered for dismantling at licensed facilities and will be incinerated with PCB oil at an incineration facility meeting international standards as defined by the Stockholm Convention. More importantly, the national PCB management team will decide on the PCB thresholds using internationally acceptable approaches and characterize the risk categories. The final decisions for treatment or disposal include several options. For example, a joint de-chlorination venture with Kenya for PCB-contaminated oil (the feasibility of which would depend on coinciding project timeframes and logistics, and cost-effectiveness), incineration in cement kilns (if practical), or export for destruction. The process for evaluating these options will be robust and will include considerations such as: condition of the equipment, convention requirements, PCB concentrations in the waste streams, and local conditions.
Furthermore, under this component, selected locations designated to serve as sites for PCB temporary storage facilities will be environmentally- and human-risk assessed. Management plans including emergency response plans for each temporary facility will be developed and implemented for each site. 150 metric tonnes of PCB oil transformer carcasses, capacitors, and contaminated soils are expected to be shipped out of the country and disposed of through high temperature incineration (standards, licensing scheme, and licensed facilities to incinerate PCBs are currently not available in Ethiopia.). The estimation of 150 metric tonnes of PCB oil transformer carcasses, capacitors and contaminated soils is based on the preliminary NIP data, the 33,000 transformers in the country, and the trends from other countries of similar nature, based on the experience of UNITAR in other countries. The precise figure will be confirmed during project implementation.
Based on other experiences from the region, the total cost of PCB disposal including transportation is in the range of USD 3,500-4,500 per ton. Factors that impact the cost include location of the port of exit, composition of PCB waste, inland transportation, and distance from the origin of PCB waste (Ethiopia) to the final destination. Djibouti will be the port of exit for the Ethiopian PCB materials; Djibouti has been a point of transit for other hazardous waste exports for disposal operations in the past. This possibility was confirmed by a representative of Djibouti, provided that necessary support documentation as per the Basel and Stockholm Conventions are provided to the competent authority in Djibouti.
Training (both theoretical and practical) will be conducted before the commencement of each activity planned under this component.
Considering the training required and the potential additional costs linked to the fact that Ethiopia is a landlocked country, which can make the operations more complex and costly, a total cost of USD 900,000 for 150 tonnes has been estimated for this component, which corresponds to USD 6,000 per tonne. This is a reasonable estimate of the expected overall costs for this disposal operation and the required necessary preparation for it. Moreover, as the project will enable the development of a comprehensive foundation for PCB management (which can also be applied to other POPs and chemicals management), subsequent projects, such as a phase 2 PCB project (which will not require foundational activities), will be implementable at greatly reduced costs compared to other PCB projects.
Component 4
:
Monitoring, evaluation and replication
Under this component, an internal project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) team will be constituted. The M&E team will regularly provide quarterly reports on project performance, stakeholders’ views on project impacts, and recommendations for improvements. Yearly lessons-learned reports will be prepared and disseminated. Lessons learnt and case study reports for each demonstration project (e.g. upgrading temporary storage sites) will be prepared for each project milestone, endorsed by national stakeholders, and shared internally and externally with other project countries such as Kenya and others, where similar projects are envisaged, and generally with countries implementing PCB management projects. Best practices for introduction of ESM will be identified, documented, and disseminated to participants, other stakeholders and Parties of the Stockholm Convention. The national project website will be developed for engagement, sharing good practices, guidance/tools, and experience. End-of-project publications will be prepared and disseminated.

He gave an explanation to the ambassadors of the member countries about the fair.
=========
In his explanation, the Minister of Innovation and Technology, Dietta Dr. Baysa, said that the Greater Southern Fair for Endogenous Technology (GresFET) organized by the Southern Cooperation Organization and the Ministry of Innovation and Technology in Dada will be a platform for technology and innovation experts and researchers from different member countries to participate and exchange experience.
Secretary General of the Southern Cooperation Organization, Sheikh Mansoor Bin Musallam, said that in addition to technology buyers and users, we should be creators of the industrial revolution and technology producers by supporting indigenous technologies.
The fair will be held from September 18 to 24/2017 and it is a fair where selected endogenous technologies from 28 member countries including Ethiopia will be presented and promoted.
This endogenous technology exhibition is attended by more than 28 countries and affiliated organizations, where at least three (3) endogenous technology products from each member country will be presented and a total of more than 100 technologists will be on display.
Ministers and other senior government officials of the Southern Cooperation Organization member countries will be present at the event, and it is expected to create favorable conditions for research institutes, universities, private researchers and other communities to contribute to the development of their country.

Innovation Development
Innovation Development
Coordinate, promote and lead the national Business, tech and Research based Innovation and Startup Ecosystem development.
In particular, the unit operates to meet ministry’s goal to enable the Ethiopia’s startup ecosystem reaching the fourth stage of its life cycle, which would enable Ethiopia’s startup ecosystem to finally integrate with the global fabrics of knowledge, produce a global business model, and achieve high global market reach in the long run. In the near future, the unit places its priority on the first cycle, which is the activation ecosystem life cycle, which is stifled by challenges such as limited ecosystem experience, challenges of resource leakages to later-stage ecosystems that inhibit growth, and also activation cycle success indicators such as triggering the globalization ecosystem life cycle through multiple startups with 100 million+ USD exits and through national resource attraction in some of our regions, such as Kenya’s and Nigeria’s startup ecosystems Among many other activities, the unit technically coordinates Startup Designation Provision Services based on legal and regulatory frameworks.

Ўзбекистон Республикаси Президентининг мақоми
Ўзбекистон Республикаси Президентининг мақоми Ўзбекистон Республикаси Конституциясининг XIX бобида белгилаб берилган
Ўзбекистон Республикасининг Президенти давлат бошлиғидир ва давлат ҳокимияти органларининг келишилган ҳолда фаолият юритишини ҳамда ҳамкорлигини таъминлайди.
Ўзбекистон Республикаси Президенти лавозимига ўттиз беш ёшдан кичик бўлмаган, давлат тилини яхши биладиган, бевосита сайловгача камида 10 йил Ўзбекистон ҳудудида муқим яшаётган Ўзбекистон Республикаси фуқароси сайланиши мумкин. Айни бир шахс сурункасига икки муддатдан ортиқ Ўзбекистон Республикасининг Президенти бўлиши мумкин эмас.
Ўзбекистон Республикасининг Президенти Ўзбекистон Республикасининг фуқаролари томонидан умумий, тенг ва тўғридан-тўғри сайлов ҳуқуқи асосида яширин овоз бериш йўли билан етти йил муддатга сайланади. Ўзбекистон Республикасининг Президентини сайлаш тартиби қонун билан белгиланади.
Ўзбекистон Республикаси Президенти ўз вазифасини бажариб турган даврда бошқа ҳақ тўланадиган лавозимни эгаллаши, вакиллик органининг депутати бўлиши, тадбиркорлик фаолияти билан шуғулланиши мумкин эмас.
Ўзбекистон Республикаси Президентининг шахси дахлсиздир ва қонун билан муҳофаза этилади.
Ўзбекистон Республикасининг Президенти:
1) фуқароларнинг ҳуқуқлари ва эркинликларига, Ўзбекистон Республикасининг Конституцияси ва қонунларига риоя этилишининг, Ўзбекистон Республикаси суверенитети, хавфсизлиги ва ҳудудий яхлитлигининг кафилидир, миллий-давлат тузилиши масалаларига доир қарорларни амалга ошириш юзасидан зарур чора-тадбирлар кўради;

Шавкат Миромонович Мирзиёев 1957 йил 24 июлда Жиззах вилоятининг Зомин туманида шифокор оиласида туғилган. Миллати – ўзбек. Олий маълумотли, 1981 йили Тошкент ирригация ва қишлоқ хўжалигини механизациялаш муҳандислари институтини тугатган. Муҳандис-механик мутахассислигига эга. Техника фанлари номзоди, доцент.

Ижро ҳокимиятидаги фаолияти билан бир пайтда 1995-2003 йилларда Ўзбекистон Республикаси Олий Мажлисининг депутати сифатида ҳам мамлакатни сиёсий, ижтимоий-иқтисодий ривожлантириш ҳамда демократик ислоҳотларни амалга ошириш борасидаги муҳим қонун ҳужжатларини ишлаб чиқиш ва қабул қилиш жараёнида фаол иштирок этиб, самарали фаолият олиб борди.
Ш.М.Мирзиёев 2003 йилда Ўзбекистон Республикасининг Бош вазири этиб тасдиқланди ва ушбу лавозимга яна уч марта – 2005, 2010, 2015 йилларда Олий Мажлис палаталари томонидан қайта тасдиқланди.
Ш.М.Мирзиёев мамлакатимиз мустақилликка эришган илк йиллардан бошлаб Ўзбекистон Республикасининг Биринчи Президенти Ислом Каримовнинг юксак ишончини қозониб, унинг яқин сафдоши ва маслаҳатдоши сифатида самарали фаолият олиб бормоқда.
Ш.М.Мирзиёев Ҳукумат бошлиғи сифатида кенг кўламли ижтимоий-иқтисодий ислоҳотларни амалга ошириш, мамлакатимизни модернизация қилиш ва янгилаш, йирик ва ноёб лойиҳаларни ҳаётга жорий этиш, хусусий мулкни устувор даражада ривожлантириш, иқтисодиётда кичик бизнес ва хусусий тадбиркорликнинг улушини кескин ошириш ҳамда уларнинг ҳуқуқий ҳимоясини янада мустаҳкамлашда ўзининг юксак салоҳияти ва моҳир ташкилотчилик қобилиятини намоён этди.
Мамлакат иқтисодиётини индустриал ривожлантириш, республиканинг экспорт салоҳиятини ошириш, аграр соҳани тубдан ислоҳ қилиш, айниқса, фермерлик ҳаракатини тараққий топтириш, қишлоқ хўжалиги маҳсулотларини чуқур қайта ишлаш, республикада озиқ-овқат хавфсизлигини таъминлаш ва аҳолини кафолатланган ва арзон маҳсулотлар билан таъминлаш ишларига устувор даражада эътибор қаратди.
Юртимизнинг барча ҳудудларида улкан бунёдкорлик ва ободончилик ишларини олиб бориш, аҳолига сифатли коммунал хизмат кўрсатиш, республиканинг шаҳар ва туманлари, айниқса, узоқ қишлоқ туманларини комплекс ривожлантириш орқали аҳолининг турмуш ва меҳнат шароитини тубдан яхшилашга қаратилган кенг кўламли ва самарали тадбирларни амалга оширди.

Ўзини ўзи бошқаришнинг ноёб институти бўлган маҳалланинг нуфузи ва обрўсини янада ошириш, шунингдек, бошқа жамоат ташкилотларини демократик ислоҳотларга кенг жалб этиш орқали жамиятда уларнинг мавқеини мустаҳкамлаш, миллий маънавий қадриятларни эъзозлаш ва изчил ривожлантириш ишларига юқори даражада эътибор қаратди.
Қайд этилганлар билан бир қаторда, иқтисодий ва ижтимоий вазифаларни амалга оширишда хорижий давлатлар ва халқаро тузилмалар, шунингдек, халқаро молия институтлари билан ҳар томонлама ўзаро ҳамкорликни кучайтириш орқали мамлакатимизнинг миллий манфаатларига ва иқтисодий ривожланишига хизмат қиладиган келишувларга эришишда бевосита раҳбарлик қилди.

Mehnat faoliyatini 1981-yilda Toshkent irrigatsiya va qishloq xo‘jaligini mexanizatsiyalash muhandislari institutida boshlab, kichik ilmiy xodim, katta o‘qituvchi, dotsent, o‘quv ishlari bo‘yicha prorektor lavozimlarida ishladi.

1992-yilda Toshkent shahrining Mirzo Ulug‘bek tumani hokimi lavozimiga tayinlandi. 1996-2001-yillarda Jizzax viloyati hokimi, 2001-2003-yillar mobaynida Samarqand viloyati hokimi lavozimlarida ishlab, mazkur tuman va viloyatlarni ijtimoiy-iqtisodiy jihatdan rivojlantirishga katta hissa qo‘shdi.
Ijro hokimiyatidagi faoliyati bilan bir paytda 1995-2003-yillarda O‘zbekiston Respublikasi Oliy Majlisining deputati sifatida ham mamlakatni siyosiy, ijtimoiy-iqtisodiy rivojlantirish hamda demokratik islohotlarni amalga oshirish borasidagi muhim qonun hujjatlarini ishlab chiqish va qabul qilish jarayonida faol ishtirok etib, samarali faoliyat olib bordi.
Sh.M.Mirziyoyev 2003-yilda O‘zbekiston Respublikasining Bosh vaziri etib tasdiqlandi va ushbu lavozimga yana uch marta – 2005, 2010, 2015-yillarda Oliy Majlis palatalari tomonidan qayta tasdiqlandi.
Sh.M.Mirziyoyev mamlakatimiz mustaqillikka erishgan ilk yillardan boshlab O‘zbekiston Respublikasining Birinchi Prezidenti Islom Karimovning yuksak ishonchini qozonib, uning yaqin safdoshi va maslakdoshi sifatida samarali faoliyat olib bormoqda.
Sh.M.Mirziyoyev Hukumat boshlig‘i sifatida keng ko‘lamli ijtimoiy-iqtisodiy islohotlarni amalga oshirish, mamlakatimizni modernizatsiya qilish va yangilash, yirik va noyob loyihalarni hayotga joriy etish, xususiy mulkni ustuvor darajada rivojlantirish, iqtisodiyotda kichik biznes va xususiy tadbirkorlikning ulushini keskin oshirish hamda ularning huquqiy himoyasini yanada mustahkamlashda o‘zining yuksak salohiyati va mohir tashkilotchilik qobiliyatini namoyon etdi.
Mamlakat iqtisodiyotini industrial rivojlantirish, respublikaning eksport salohiyatini oshirish, agrar sohani tubdan isloh qilish, ayniqsa, fermerlik harakatini taraqqiy toptirish, qishloq xo‘jaligi mahsulotlarini chuqur qayta ishlash, respublikada oziq-ovqat xavfsizligini ta’minlash va aholini kafolatlangan va arzon mahsulotlar bilan ta’minlash ishlariga ustuvor darajada e’tibor qaratdi.
Yurtimizning barcha hududlarida ulkan bunyodkorlik va obodonchilik ishlarini olib borish, aholiga sifatli kommunal xizmat ko‘rsatish, respublikaning shahar va tumanlari, ayniqsa, uzoq qishloq tumanlarini kompleks rivojlantirish orqali aholining turmush va mehnat sharoitini tubdan yaxshilashga qaratilgan keng ko‘lamli va samarali tadbirlarni amalga oshirdi.
Sh.M.Mirziyoyevning faoliyatida sotsial-iqtisodiy masalalar bilan bir qatorda ta’lim, fan, sog‘liqni saqlash tizimlarini zamonaviy talablar asosida rivojlantirish, yoshlarning sog‘lom va barkamol bo‘lib voyaga yetishlari uchun munosib shart-sharoitlar yaratish, onalik va bolalikni kuchli muhofaza qilish ustuvor vazifa sifatida muhim o‘rin egalladi.
O‘zini o‘zi boshqarishning noyob instituti bo‘lgan mahallaning nufuzi va obro‘sini yanada oshirish, shuningdek, boshqa jamoat tashkilotlarini demokratik islohotlarga keng jalb etish orqali jamiyatda ularning mavqeini mustahkamlash, milliy ma’naviy qadriyatlarni e’zozlash va izchil rivojlantirish ishlariga yuqori darajada e’tibor qaratdi.
Qayd etilganlar bilan bir qatorda, iqtisodiy va ijtimoiy vazifalarni amalga oshirishda xorijiy davlatlar va xalqaro tuzilmalar, shuningdek, xalqaro moliya institutlari bilan har tomonlama o‘zaro hamkorlikni kuchaytirish orqali mamlakatimizning milliy manfaatlariga va iqtisodiy rivojlanishiga xizmat qiladigan kelishuvlarga erishishda bevosita rahbarlik qildi.
2016-yil 8-sentabr kuni O‘zbekiston Respublikasi Oliy Majlisi Qonunchilik palatasi va Senatining qo‘shma majlisida parlament palatalarining qo‘shma qaroriga muvofiq O‘zbekiston Respublikasi Prezidentining vazifa va vakolatlarini bajarish vaqtincha O‘zbekiston Respublikasi Bosh vaziri Sh.M.Mirziyoyev zimmasiga yuklandi.

Ш.М. Мирзиёев в 2003 году был утвержден Премьер-министром Республики Узбекистан и еще три раза – в 2005, 2010, 2015 годах – утверждался на этот пост палатами Олий Мажлиса.
С первых лет независимости нашей Родины Ш.М. Мирзиёев, заслужив высокое доверие Первого Президента Республики Узбекистан Ислама Каримова, самоотверженно работает как его соратник и единомышленник.
Ш.М.

Особое внимание в своей работе он уделял развитию экономики на индустриальной основе, повышению экспортного потенциала страны, коренному реформированию аграрной сферы, в первую очередь широкому развитию фермерского движения, глубокой переработке сельскохозяйственной продукции, обеспечению продовольственной безопасности республики и гарантированному обеспечению населения потребительскими товарами по доступным ценам.
В целях кардинального улучшения условий жизни и труда населения Ш.М.

The President visits the new building of the Ministry of construction and housing and communal services
30.12.2025
President Shavkat Mirziyoyev got acquainted with the development work on the territory of New Tashkent.
The Head of our state started his trip with visiting the construction site of underground parking and pedestrian crossing.
The parking worth $100 million, the construction of which is carried out on an area of 40 thousand square meters, will provide an opportunity to accommodate 200 cars and 30 motorcycles and scooters. For convenient and safe movement of the pedestrians a four-way crossing will be constructed.
Automated parking systems, points for renting bicycles and stations for charging electric vehicles will be organized here. The facility is planned to be launched in 2026.
The President gave instructions on increasing the number of modern parking lots, ensuring their extensive access and convenience for the population, as well as further developing charging infrastructure considering the growth of electric vehicles share.
Additionally, administrative buildings for organization of ministries and agencies work are being developed in New Tashkent.
Particularly, a new modular building of the Ministry of construction and housing and communal services has been constructed.
The territory of 1,5 hectares accommodates 5 one-story buildings built from light metal constructions and sandwich panels with basalt covering on the total area of 5751 square meters.
The building allows to accommodate the central office of the ministry and all of its subordinate organizations in one place, which increases the effectiveness of interaction and working processes between the entities.
Light constructions and energy-efficient sandwich panels, independent sewage systems, as well as an effective centralized heating, cooling and ventilation systems will allow to decrease exploitation costs of the building, ensure an opportunity of its expansion and dismantling in the future.
Currently there are 550 employees working in the new building, engaged in the activities of central office of the ministry and its subordinate organizations.
The building also houses the Republican center for development of information and communication technologies under the Ministry of construction and housing and communal services.
To date the center launched a range of platforms based on “Shaffof kurilish” national information system.
The Head of State was briefed on the activities of these platforms.
In particular, all socio-economic data relating to cities and districts have been consolidated into a single digital database in the geographic information system “State Urban Development Cadastre of the Republic of Uzbekistan.” Through the geoportal, three-dimensional “digital twins” of settlements have been developed, reconstruction and renovation zones have been identified, and the possibility of conducting a comprehensive analysis of territories has been created.

Tasks on full utilization of Surkhandarya region’s potential defined
24.12.2025
On December 24, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev held a meeting on the issues of socio-economic development, jobs creation and poverty reduction in Surkhandarya region.
Thanks to the conditions created and the preferences provided, over the past eight years the region has attracted $3 billion of foreign investment, and about 4 thousand industrial enterprises have been launched. It’s expected that the volume of industry will double and reach 17,2 trillion soums this year. Such new sectors have been created in the region, including manufacturing footwear, jewelry, construction materials and pharmaceuticals.
The good results have also been achieved in poverty reduction. According to estimates, 126 thousand of families will be lifted out of poverty this year, and the poverty level will decrease from 9,3 to 5,6 percent. The issue of drinking water has been fully resolved for 2 million people living in Sherabad, Baysun, Bandikhan, Muzrabat, Altynsay, Angor, Jarkurgan and Denau districts through the pipeline project from Topalang water reservoir.
Despite this, possessing rich natural resources and developed infrastructure, Surkhandarya region lags behind several regions in industry and agriculture, services and tourism. In particular, the volume of industrial output in the region is 1,5 times less than in Syrdarya region, 1,8 times less than in Djizzakh region, and 2 times less than in Khorezm region.
The export of fruits and vegetables also is also inferior to similar indicators of Samarkand, Tashkent, Fergana and Khorezm. It was noted that the deposits of natural resources of the region are estimated at $500 billion, however even 10 percent of this potential hasn’t been utilized.
In this regard, an objective was set to transform the region into the one with the most dynamic growth of investments, jobs, residents’ revenue and export.
The meeting highlighted the need to launch new projects next year based on the 114 deposits of natural resources identified in the region. Plans were outlined to start the implementation on their basis of 91 projects worth $3,2 billion, among which projects worth $2 billion must be launched already next year.
Moreover, 175 billion soums will be allocated for the infrastructure of driver initiatives, 36 projects worth 1 trillion 200 billion soums will be implemented at their expense and 9 thousand jobs will be created.
During the discussion of tasks in the sphere of tourism, it was noted that there are 47 hotels in the region, 4-star and 5-star, as well as brand hotels are absent. The necessity was emphasized to fully utilize the opportunities of the areas with high tourism potential, including Baysun, Sangardak and Omonkhon, increase the number of hotels, organize new touristic destinations and facilities.
It was noted that 60 percent of the production of fruits and vegetables in agriculture accounts for Denau, Sherabad, Kumkurgan, Jarkurgan, Muzrabat and Saryosiyo districts. A task was set to develop specific projects for the increase of export also in Angor, Kizirik, Termez and Uzun, as well as other specialized districts.
During the meeting, khokim of Surkhandarya region presented his plans on utilizing these and other opportunities.
The Head of our state also gave instructions regarding modernization of roads, construction of residential buildings and improvement of social infrastructure in the region.

Биографија
Званична фотографија председника Републике Србије Александра Вучића/ Фото Председништво - Димитрије Голл
Александар Вучић
Председник Републике Србије
Рођен је 5. марта 1970. године у Београду. Завршио је Земунску гимназију 1988. године, а дипломирао на Правном факултету Универзитета у Београду 1994. године.
Приступа Српској радикалној странци 1993. године. Исте године изабран је за посланика у Народној скупштини Републике Србије, а за генералног секретара те странке 1994. године. На тој дужности остаје до 2008. године.
Именован је за директора спортско-пословног центра „Пинки“ у Земуну 1996. године. Успео је да реконструише ово запуштено спортско здање и успешним пословањем вишеструко повећа примања запослених.
Именован је за министра информисања у Влади националног јединства 1998. године.
Био је посланик у Савезној скупштини СРЈ у три мандата: у Већу република од фебруара 1998. и од маја 2000. године, а од 24. септембра 2000. године изабран је за посланика на савезним изборима.
На локалним изборима за градоначелника Београда "Вучић за метрополу" осваја 29 одсто гласова у првом кругу избора, односно 48 одсто гласова у другом кругу. На локалним изборима за градоначелника Београда одржаним у мају 2008. године осваја 34,7 одсто гласова.
Са Томиславом Николићем оснива Српску напредну странку, а на оснивачкој конвенцији у октобру 2008. године изабран је за заменика председника странке.
Након општих парламентарних избора одржаних 2012. године преузима функцију министра одбране и првог потпредседника Владе Републике Србије задуженог за борбу против корупције и криминала.
После оставке Томислава Николића због избора за председника Србије на председничким изборима 2012. године постаје в.д. лидера Српске напредне странке 24. маја 2012. године. На Другом конгресу странке одржаном 29. септембра 2012. године једногласно је изабран за председника те странке.
Обављао је функцију министра одбране од 27. јула 2012. године до реконструкције Владе Републике Србије 2. септембра 2013. године.
Активно учествује у преговорима Владе Републике Србије и привремених институција власти у Приштини под покровитељством Европске уније. Допринео је томе да у априлу 2013. године дође до потписивања бриселског споразума, чиме је по први пут од 1999. године створена реална основа за то да српски народ који живи на Косову и Метохији успостави институције које ће бити признате од међународне заједнице.
Од септембра 2013. године задржава само функцију првог потпредседника Владе задуженог за борбу против корупције и криминала.
Након победе СНС на изборима одржаним 16. марта 2014. године изабран је за председника Владе Србије, која је формирана 27. априла 2014. године. Функцију премијера обављао је до августа 2016. године, када је, након победе СНС на изборима одржаним 24. априла 2016. године, започео нови мандат на месту председника Владе Србије.
Влада коју је водио Александар Вучић постигла је историјски успех проводећи најтеже економске реформе у савременој српској историји. Привремено смањујући пензије и плате у јавном сектору, Србију је спасао од банкротства, опоравио буџет и почео да смањује јавни дуг Србије.
Након победе на председничким изборима одржаним 2. априла 2017. године изабран је за председника Републике Србије.
Србију види као економски обновљену, уређену, модерну европску државу, регионалног лидера у економији, политици, инфраструкури, енергетици, стабилности сваке врсте, афирмацији људских права и слобода, али и у образовању, култури, науци, просвећености, спорту и наталитету.
Добитник је награде „Капетан Миша Анастасијевић“ за личност године 2012, као и награде "Личност године 2013" у избору "Независних новина" Босне и Херцеговине.
Такође, добио је и награде "Човек године 2013" у избору европског магазина "Ман", "Најевропљанин 2013" у избору међународне организације "Прва европска кућа", "Видовданске награде 2013." коју додељује Град Крушевац и награду "Регионални лидер 2014" у избору регионалног жирија и читалаца "Вечерњег листа" Босне и Херцеговине.
Страствени је читалац, нарочито литературе из области историографије и геополитике, али и српске и светске књижевности. Поседује завидну личну библиотеку.
Игра шах, радо прати утакмице кошарке и фудбала.
Течно говори енглески и руски, служи се француским и учи немачки језик.
Ожењен је Тамаром Вучић, отац Данила, Милице и Вукана.

Заклетву је положио на Уставу Србије и Мирослављевом јеванђељу:
"Заклињем се да ћу све своје снаге посветити очувању суверености и целине територије Републике Србије, укључујући и Косово и Метохију као њен саставни део, као и остваривању људских и мањинских права и слобода, поштовању и одбрани Устава и закона, очувању мира и благостања свих грађана Републике Србије и да ћу савесно и одговорно испуњавати све своје дужности".
Вучић је за председника изабран у првом кругу избора 2. априла са освојених око 56 одсто гласова, односно подршком више од два милиона бирача.
Пре тога, Вучић се на уласку у здање Дома Народне скупштине обратио грађанима који су га дочекали како би му дали подршку и честитали на ступању на нову дужност.
Вучића и сада већ бившег председника Србије Томислава Николића дочекала је председница парламента Маја Гојковић.
Свечаном полагању заклетве присуствовали су бивши председници Србије, председник Републике Српске Милорад Додик, чланови Владе Србије, представници дипломатског кора, верских заједница, и јавног и културног живота Србије...
Након полагања заклетве Вучић се обратио посланицима и гостима и поручио да ће му мир и стабилност бити срж политичког деловања.

Говор председника Србије Александра Вучића у Скупштини
Нови председник Србије, Александар Вучић, обратио се по полагању заклетве посланицима и гостима у националном парламенту, а његово обраћање у целини гласи:
"Драги суграђани, народни посланици Скупштине Републике Србије...
Данас, када стојим пред вама, пред Србијом, свим њеним грађанима, баш недалеко од места на коме је далеке 1830. године Милош Велики прогласио Први хатишериф и утемељио самосталност модерне Србије, више ми је него јасно да, колико год да сам се за то припремао, а припремао се јесам, читав свој политички живот, ипак не могу да нађем довољно речи да сажмем, објасним, и страх и наду, које осећам преузимајући ову, за мене свету, дужност и обавезу.
И знам, исто колико и сваки човек у овој земљи, да су ми, за то да будем председник Србије, дела потребна, много више него речи, и да ће она, коначна, реч, и суд, бити изречени, не данас, него оног дана када будем напуштао ову дужност, када будем завршио са овом најчаснијом обавезом.
Данас, на овом месту, желим да се захвалим свим претходним председницима Републике који су дали свој допринос прогресу и просперитету Србије. Посебно, хоћу да одам признање председнику Николићу, не куртоазно, већ због тога што је имао храбрости да подржи најтеже, али једине целисходне мере које је Влада предузимала на путу опоравка Србије. Хвала и желим вам, господине председниче, много успеха у даљем раду.
Научио сам да пред овим високим домом износим програм за рад Владе, обиман и свеобухватан, а данас, у складу са традицијом ове свечаности, изнећу неколико назнака, принципа, начела и законитости којих ћу се држати током трајања мандата, настојећи да, за то време, променим, и себе, и Србију, и у томе охрабрим и сваког њеног грађанина, таман толико да она постане боља, јача, богатија и срећнија земља, а сви ми, задовољнији и остваренији људи.
Посао је то, знам врло добро, за читаве генерације, али исто тако знам да неко мора да га почне, да мора да искорачи, преузме на себе тај, први, залет у будућност, први скок преко опасне провалије, и да тај неко, у свему томе, нема права да се бави ни својом судбином, нити били каквом личном користи, већ има да поднесе врло свесну жртву, за народ и за државу.
Другим речима, данас, баш као и пре три године када сам преузимао место председника Владе Србије, немам никакву сумњу у то шта ми је чинити.
За Србију, за њене грађане, за будућност коју треба да освојимо, морам да дам буквално све, и за то не могу, не желим и нећу да добијем буквално ништа, осим суда који ће, о томе шта сам радио, остати у историји.
И можда то некоме изгледа мало, пошто историја не предвиђа санкцију, али, за мене, тај суд је једнак оном страшном, коначном, и представља и највећу опомену и најбоље упутство за све што, у периоду који је испред мене, имам, и морам и хоћу да урадим.
Зато што је то највећи рачун који имам да положим. Пред нашом децом, и пред децом њихове деце. Све остало је, дневна политика, на коју, од данас, и по Уставу, и немам право. Бар не онолико колико сам имао до јуче.
Моје је, и ту дужност и обавезу сам добио, да водим, напред, у сутрашњост, ову прелепу, дивну земљу. Моје је, дозволите ми да парафразирам, да пронађем пут, да идем њиме, и да га покажем другима. Моје је, по препорукама које је својим наследницима, још почетком деветнаестог века, у аманет оставио чувени амерички председник Џон Квинси Адамс - да својим делима иснпиришем све остале да више уче, више сањају, више ураде, и постану више. Да Србију, нашу отаџбину, наше исходиште и наш сан, учине бољом, срећнијом, сигурнијом и богатијом земљом.
Хоћу да кажем - колико год да желим јаку, сигурну и богату Србију, не могу до ње сам. Потребна нам је енергија, снага, воља и јасна визија такве Србије, у сваком од њеном грађанину, у читавом народу који је, дајући ми овај мандат, већ одлучио да крене на тај далек и тежак пут.
Потребно ми је заједништво, оно у истом циљу, у истој вери да се до њега може стићи, и у истој количини напора уложеног у његово остваривање, заједништво ослобођено дневних, партијских, идеолошких и било којих других разлика, и ја ћу, свом својом снагом, радити на том заједништву. На заједништву и јединству оних који воле Србију, оних којима је Србија преча и од личних и од партијских интереса.
Тражићу заједништво, свакога дана, захтеваћу га и борићу се за њега, уз врло кратко објашњење. Није оно потребно мени лично, политички сам се остварио, одавно, на изборима, све политичке амбиције сам иживео, оборио све изборне рекорде, немам више шта да дохватим на том небу, али, то заједништво, потребно је Србији, и сваком човеку у њој.
Зато што од наше могућности да препознамо заједнички циљ, и да уложимо у њега заједнички напор, да поднесемо исту такву, заједничку, жртву, зависи, али буквално, и да ли ће нам не само будућност бити заједничка, него и да ли ћемо је уопште и имати.
Подељена и интересима раздробљена Србија не може да стигне нигде. Распарчана амбицијама, размеђена сујетама, посвађана око идеологије, вере, партије, нације, клуба, ова земља, и свака земља, не ради ништа друго него потписује вечни акт о томе да је заувек мала, заувек и у сваком погледу сиромашна, и заувек ослобођена било какве наде у боље сутра.
Нема слободе, у поделама. Нема напретка, у свађама. Нема циља, у измаглици сукоба, нема резултата без међусобног поштовања. Не види се, не може да се препозна, нејасан је и, самим тим, недостижан.
И моја је дужност, једна од првих, да то кажем. Баш као што ми је дужност да кажем и много теже ствари, и да чујем, све оне које нису добре по мене. Уосталом, слобода и јесте, по Џорџу Орвелу, ништа друго него могућност да људима кажеш и оно што не желе да чују. И то је један од принципа којих ћу се држати. Зато што он омогућава наставак процеса који смо започели пре неколико година, и који је донео прве и озбиљне резултате.
Рекли смо истину, без обзира на то што толико њих није хтело да је чује, и почели смо да се мењамо. Да мењамо себе, и да мењамо Србију. Признали смо да нисмо никакав изабрани народ, да нисмо ни највећи ни најпаметнији, да не живимо ни на каквом небу, већ овде, у нашој Србији, и да ће нам, у њој, бити управо онако, како смо заслужили, својим радом.
Престали смо да чекамо, почели смо да тражимо. Престали смо да се правдамо, почели смо да прихватамо одговорност. Престали смо да се кријемо, почели смо да излазимо на црту, сваком изазову. Престали смо да тражимо кривце и изговоре, почели смо да откривамо грешке у нама. Престали смо да се надамо да ће нам неко нешто дати, почели смо да верујемо да можемо да створимо. Престали смо да верујемо у смрт и рат, почели смо да верујемо у живот и у тежак рад. И, на крају, престали смо да се молимо, било коме за мрвице, али смо почели да верујемо, у себе, и у Србију. И на свему томе, на тој промени, изградили смо темељ сопствене будућности, и будућности ове земље.
На том темељу, намеравам, заједно са владом Србије, да наставим да градим. Да дижем, заједно са свима у Србији, спрат по спрат, степеник по степеник, плочу по плочу, без жеље да ту грађевину икада завршим, већ да је само подигнем довољно високо, довољно стабилно, да други, после мене, после нас, могу да оду у неслућене висине.
И врло сам свестан, шта ми је потребно, шта је потребно нама, да обавимо тај ни најмање лак, ни краткотрајан задатак. А потребно нам је оно у шта се заклињао велики Томас Едисон: тежак рад, посвећеност и здрав разум. И потребно нам је да у свакој тешкоћи, а многе су пред нама, тражимо оно што је у њима тражио Алберт Анштајн - прилику да успемо. И потребно нам је, и ту ћу престати са цитатима, да, попут Томаса Џеферсона, верујемо у срећу, али и да, као и он, знамо да ње увек буде више, уколико још више и теже радимо. То је кључ за врата наше будућности. Врло прост, ако си спреман да га узмеш у руке и окренеш у правом смеру.
Тежак рад, посвећеност том тешком раду, здрав разум који нам говори да се прилике крију у препрекама које су пред нама, и срећа коју заслужујемо, освајамо, својим тешким и непрестаним радом. И када прихватимо то, та проста правила, моћи ћемо да решимо све задатке који су пред нама, а чији је број и те како велик.
Мир - стални, стабилни, плодоносни мир, у Србији и у целом региону, свакако је први од њих. И радићу на њему, разговараћу са сваким, нудићу решења, инсистираћу на дијалогу и компромису, јер дубоко верујем да је он основа сваког напретка, сваког успешног посла, и безбедне будућности. Дакле, мир и стабилност, за многе излизане речи без стварног и животног значења, јесу и биће срж мог будућег политичког деловања. Да бисмо успели да сачувамо себе, морамо да разговарамо са свима, али и да јачамо своје одбрамбене капацитете, јер само тако, можемо да сачувамо земљу од оних који нам свакодневно прете, јавно и отворено, али и тихо и прикривено.
Србија је независна и суверена земља, баш таква и само таква Србија може бити на понос свим њеним грађанима. Уосталом, слобода је вредност коју су наши грађани увек стављали на највиши пиједестал.
Због те и такве, љубљене слободе, Србија жели сама да гради и обезбеђује своју одбрану, своје границе, земљу, ваздух и воду. Зато, не желимо да улазимо у војне алијансе и пактове и учествујемо у акцијама против неких других народа и држава, као што су неки од њих учествовали у агресији на нашу Србију. Желимо да будемо своји на своме, да имамо добро опремљену и модерну армију, српску војску, која може и зна да сачува и одбрани оно што је наше.
Ми туђе нећемо, али своје никоме нећемо дати. И бићемо јаки, довољно јаки да то можемо и да учинимо. Политика војне неутралности биће политика коју ћу да штитим, али и сарадња са свима чији део не желимо да будемо, али имамо обавезу да градимо другачије и боље односе.
Такође, верујем да је читав овај регион један велики систем спојених судова, и судбина, и да нама, у Србији, не може да буде добро, уколико било коме, око нас, буде лоше.
Ми, сви заједно, не можемо много тога да нађемо, осим пријатеља, у великом свету, одавно одређеном, подељеном и устројеном, али, зато, много тога можемо да нађемо овде, на тржишту од више од двадесет милиона људи, чија величина се и крије у њиховој различитости. Можемо да се повежемо, да изградимо мостове и путеве између нас, да створимо радна места, повећамо размену, учимо једни од других, доведемо инвестиције. Можемо, уз тешак рад, здрав разум и срећу коју сами освојимо, да створимо регион у којем су разлике предност, а не основ за сукобе. Можемо да се, радећи и повезујући се, коначно разумемо, да схватимо колико зависимо једни од других, и да, створимо ону врсту будућности у којој основ наших односа, никада више, неће бити страх и зазор, због којих смо се, толико пута у историји, хватали оружја, уместо да се ухватимо посла.
И то ће бити моја основна порука, свима око нас. Хајде да стварамо послове, зато што послови стварају нас, и стварају децу, и пружају, онда, свима, нову шансу, за још више послова, и још више деце.
Доста смо се сахрањивали по Балкану, време је да се рађамо. Чуваћу интегритет Србије, али ћу увек прихватати разговоре са косовским Албанцима, јер тиме штитимо наше Србе и тиме чувамо и бранимо мир. Боље је да мени буде тешко, да се понекад осећам и пониженим, али је много важније да Србија не буде унижена и да људи у нашој земљи имају мир и спокој.
Доста смо давали смрти, време је да дамо живот, животу. Доста, готово све, сви заједно, на западном Балкану смо порушили, време је да изградимо. Доста смо, сви заједно, били жртве, сопствених страхова, време је да будемо хероји, будућности у коју верујемо.
И управо то, те поруке, јесу програм са којим ћу кренути по региону, тражећи нову шансу, за све нас који овде живимо. И нећу то радити зато што Србија од било кога страхује, него, управо супротно, радићу то баш зато што смо сваки страх оставили иза себе.
Зато хоћу и да отворимо унутрашњи дијалог по питању Косова и Метохија, уз све наше разлике, без предрасуда, а поштујући Устав наше земље. Морамо да будемо отворени, да се ослободимо митског приступа, али и олаког давања онога на шта имамо свако право. Наш унутрашњи дијалог, по том питању, можда је и важнији од оног којег треба да водимо са Албанцима.
Србија је озбиљна, јака држава, која може да се одбрани, која је посвећена својој слободи и својој сигурности, и која, управо зато, увек може, и хоће, да свакоме пружи руку, без страха шта ће се тој руци десити. Да, желимо да поправљамо односе са Хрватском, хоћемо даље да унапређујемо сарадњу и са Босном и Херцеговином, Албанијом, Црном Гором, Македонијом, али и Мађарском, Румунијом, Бугарском.
Ми не сумњамо ни у кога, али нека нико не сумња ни у нас. Ни у нашу посвећеност миру, ни у нашу спремност да се одбранимо. Баш као што не треба да буде сумње ни у европски пут којем смо се посветили. И то није фраза, или успутна обавезна реченица коју су сви политичари на Балкану научили.
Желимо да градимо демократско друштво и баш тај и такав тип друштва јесте основни разлог нашег упорног и истрајног опстајања на европском путу. Наставићемо тај пут, не молећи никога ни за шта, али чврсто верујући у себе и реформе које можемо и морамо да урадимо. Опет, не због Европе, већ због нас.
Већ много година оптужују нас да нећемо моћи да сачувамо своје јасно и искрено пријатељство са Руском Федерацијом, али смо, и у најтежим условима, успели да одолимо свим притисцима и тврдоглаво чувамо и градимо најбоље односе са руским народом и његовим државним руководством. Ту политику Србија ће следити и у будућности.
Ми се својим пријатељствима поносимо, а нимало не стидимо.
Успели смо, у последњих неколико година, више него икада раније, да изградимо срдачне и веома топле пријатељске односе са Народном Републиком Кином. Помогли су нам преузимањем смедеревске железаре, али и учешћем у бројним инфраструктурним и пројектима из области енергетике и рударства.
Успоставили смо нове односе са Индијом, унапредили са Јапаном и Јужном Корејом, а још много труда морамо да уложимо у стратешко поправљање односа са Сједињеним Америчким Државама. Онај ко не би градио пријатељство са Америком, без обзира на наше разлике по питању Косова и Метохије, чинио би велику грешку и направио би огромну штету нашој Србији. То, свакако, нећу да учиним.
Ми хоћемо отворену, широку Србију, Србију за све, спремну на сарадњу, жељну рада и нових прилика, за нови рад. Хоћемо Србију различитих нација, које живе у миру и слози, хоћемо људе које нећемо препознавати само по њиховој вери, већ по поштењу и марљивости.
Зато што је то и најбољи начин, пошто рад захтева правила, да уредимо своју земљу, да исправимо све оно што још нисмо исправили, да је начинимо удобном за сваког човека у њој.
И томе ћу се посебно посветити, и тражићу и од Владе и од Скупштине да убрзано наставе са реформама, од којих су оне у правосуђу вероватно најнеопходније, али никако и једине, и да, сви заједно, наставимо са свакодневним променама, у сваком сегменту нашег јавног живота, како би, у најскорије време, могли с правом и мирно да кажемо - ми, Србија, јесмо и Европа и свет, по сваком стандарду који у Европи и савременом свету постоји.
Планирам да отворимо разговоре о уставним реформама. На то смо обавезани наставком нашег европског пута, али и унутрашњим потребама. До тих промена не можемо да дођемо без договора, без много разговора и расправа о ономе што би, можда по први пут, били наши стратешки циљеви у будућности. У те разговоре биће неопходно да укључимо све друштвене чиниоце, од Академије наука, цивилног друштва, политичких странака. Уосталом, то је велики и важан циљ, а ако не успемо, и онако биће само још један од наших неуспеха да се сагласимо око кључних државних питања.
Треба гледати право. Јер да се хтело гледати иза себе, добили бисмо очи на потиљку. Треба љубити земљу деце своје, а не дедова својих. Јер част неће зависити од тога одакле долазимо, већ куда идемо. То је записао велики Бора Пекић, а ја ћу покушати, онолико колико будем могао, да пратим те његове истините и величанствене речи.
То је, драги суграђани, поштовани народни посланици, посао који је пред нама, и којим намаравам да се бавим. Не плашим га се, јер, знате како кажу, нико се још у свом зноју није удавио, тако да могу мирно, и то и намеравам, поштено да се ознојим.
Уосталом, на то ме тера и историја. Пре осам стотина година, 1217. крунисањем Стефана Првовенчаног, Србија је постала међународно призната држава. Пре две стотине година, 1817., Србија је, после векова ропства, добила аутономију, и направила први корак ка новој државности.
Данас, 2017. године, вероватно се ништа тако велико и значајно није десило, осим једне ствари. Србија је добила председника који ће за њу да се бори, свим срцем свом снагом и енергијом. Добијено је од народа, и у име народа и за народ. За народ, који ће за мене, његовог председника, бити исти, и по правима и по шансама, и по могућностима да од мене тражи, да од мене захтева.
Желим да као председник Србије увек будем уз наш народ који живи у нашем окружењу, да увек будем уз Републику Српску, али и Србе у Црној Гори, Хрватској, Македонији, Словенији и Румунији. Да помогнем очување храмова и манастира српске цркве у свим тим земљама, јер само тамо где је Српска православна црква снажна, на простору бивше Југославије, наш народ успео је и могао да сачува своја огњишта.
Хоћу да се захвалим, на крају, нашем народу, свим нашим грађанима, на огромној подршци, на нади и вери у другачију и бољу будућност, а после свега на одговорности и помоћи да државне послове обављамо на најбољи начин.
И верујем да ћу, уз вашу помоћ, драги грађани Србије, умети да одговорим, на свако питање, и на сваки захтев, на сваки изазов који је преда мном. Зато што, а рекао је то Лао Це, то што те неко воли, даје ти снагу, а то што ти некога волиш, даје ти храброст. А ја ову земљу, волим, изнад свега. И то ће ме чинити веома храбрим председником. Све остало, на мени је да заслужим.
Хвала вам на пажњи."

TITLE: На челу Србије
    | Председник Републике Србије

На челу Србије
*Списак је саставио Историјски институт Београд.
Вишеслав
– први познати архонт (кнез) Срба. Припадао је породици која је владала Србима још пре доласка на Балкан. Из времена владавине Вишеслава, његовог сина Радослава и унука Просигоја нису познати никакви одређени подаци. Према сачуваним изворима Срби су за време њих тројице живели у миру са Бугарима.
Радослав
– син Вишеслава
Просигој
– син Радослава
Властимир
– син Просигоја. Први владар Срба о којем је сачувано нешто више података и чију владавину је могуће приближно хронолошки одредити. Током његове владавине дошло је до трогодишњег рата са Бугарима којима је тада владао кан Пресијам (836-852). Познато је да су га синови наследили још за Пресијамовог живота, те се претпоставља да је крај његове владавине падао најкасније у 851. Власт српских кнежева се током Властимирове владавине проширила и на другу страну динарског масива. Удао је кћерку за Крајину, сина Велоја, жупана Травуније. Зету Велоју је дао титулу кнеза. Тако је очувана локална травуњанска династија, наравно под врховном влашћу кнежева Србије. Властимир је имао три сина: Мутимира, Стројимира и Гојника.
Мутимир
– кнеза Властимира су наследила тројица синова који су поделили државну територију. Мутимир је, као најстарији, био главни владар. Против Србије је током његове владавине заратио бугарски кан Борис. Срби су поразили бугарску војску и заробили 12 великих бољара и најстаријег кановог сина Владимира. Нешто касније, Мутимир је изашао као победник из сукоба са браћом, које је, да би их онемогућио, предао бугарском владару Борису. Задржао је Гојниковог сина Петра, који је убрзо успео да побегне у Хрватску. Мутимир је умро око 891/892. Имао је три сина Прибислава, Брана и Стефана.
Прибислав
– син Мутимира. Дошао је на власт после очеве смрти 891/892, али је владао само око годину дана. Збацио га је са власти брат од стрица Петар Гојниковић. Прибислав и његова браћа су уточиште нашли у Хрватској.
Петар Гојниковић
– син Гојника. На власт је дошао 892/893. године. После три године, 895. или 896. успео је да порази, зароби и ослепи Мутимировог сина Брана који га је напао. Недуго затим, 897. или 898, као нови супарник појавио се Стројимиров син Клонимир који је одраније живео у Бугарској. Петар га је поразио и убио. Наредне две деценије владао је углавном мирно. Проширио је власт на земљу Неретљана. Када је бугарски цар Симеон сазнао да преговара са Византинцима послао је у Србију војску на челу са Павлом, сином Брана. Бугари су заробили Петра и одвели га у Бугарску где је до краја живота био затвореник.
Павле Брановић
– син Брана. Дошао је на власт 917. као штићеник бугарског цара Симеона чију је врховну власт признавао. Владао је до 920. Византинци, незадовољни променама у Србији и бугарским утицајем, покушали су да га збаце уз помоћ Захарије, сина Прибислава, који је живео у Цариграду. Павле га је заробио и предао Бугарима. Касније је Павле признао врховну власт византијског цара и тиме постао непријатељ Бугарске. Са престола га је 920, уз помоћ Бугара, протерао Захарије.
Захарије Прибислављевић
– син Прибислава. Уз помоћ Бугара дошао је на власт 920. Учврстивши се на власти пришао је Византији. Пред бугарском војском био је приморан 924. да се склони у Хрватску. Бугарски цар Симеон је са војском послао у Србију и Часлава, сина Клонимировог. Жупани који су били сазвани да приме новог кнеза били су заробљени и одведени у Бугарску. У Бугарску је у заточеништво одведено и бројно српско становништво. Део становништва је побегао у Хрватску, а део се склонио на византијске територије. Србија је 924. после готово читавог века отпора освојена од стране Бугарске. Српске кнежевине у Приморју биле су поштеђене од бугарског освајања.
Часлав
– син Клонимира. Искористио је смрт цара Симеона (927) да побегне из Бугарске. Завладао је Србијом уз помоћ малог броја присталица и признао врховну власт византијског цара. Успео је да обнови и знатно ојача земљу опустошену унутрашњим борбама и најездама суседних држава. По легендарном казивању погинуо је у сукобу са Мађарима. Са Чаславом се прекида низ познатих владара из најстарије српске династије и дотадашњи политички живот у границама једне пространије српске државе. Држава кнеза Часлава простирала се на северу до Саве, на западу према Врбасу, на исток до Ибра, на југу до планина које су је одвајале од приморских српских земаља које су чиниле Паганија (област Неретљана), Захумље, Травунија и Дукља. У њеном саставу се налазила и Босна, која је тада обухватала долину истоимене реке.
Вукан
– велики жупан. Дукљански краљ Бодин је осамдесетих године XI века поставио Вукана и Марка за жупане у Србији, а Стефана у Босни. Од његовог времена Срби почињу да се шире на област Косова и према југоистоку. Привремено је освојио Липљан, продирао према Пологу, Скопљу и Врању. На крају је морао да се покори византијском цару Алексију I Комнину и преда таоце међу којима су била и његова два синовца Урош и Стефан Вукан, као и двадесет највиших представника српске властеле (1094). Вуканов утицај у српским земљама је нарочито порастао након смрти краља Бодина (1101). Рашка је постала најмоћнија српска област и за њу се све више везује појам Србија. Не помиње се након 1106. када је водио нове борбе са Византијом.
Урош I
– велики жупан. Преузео власт након Вуканове смрти. У покушају да се ослободи зависности од Византије ступио је у тешњу везу са Угарском. Угарски краљ Стефан II (1116-1131) оженио је сина Белу II (1131-1141) Урошевом кћерком Јеленом. Преговори о браку окончани су годину–две пре Белиног ступања на престо. Урош I је изгледа био у родбинским везама и са дукљанским крaљем Ђорђем, који га је једном приликом ослободио из заточеништва у које су га бацили сродници. Имао је три сина Уроша II, Белоша и Десу. Поред Јелене имао је и кћерку Марију која је била удата за кнеза Конрада од Знојма, члана чешке владајуће династије Пшемисловића.
Урош II
– велики жупан. Син Уроша I. Сигурно се на положају великог жупана налазио 1146. Поражен је у сукобу са Византијом 1150. и био приморан да обнови вазалске обавезе према византијском цару. Србија је раније била дужна да у случају рата у Азији упути цару одред од 300 војника, а сада је тај број повећан на 500. У случају војних операција у Европи тај број је остао исти – 2000 ратника. Урош II је привремено збачен са власти 1155. за време немира који су захватили земљу и саму великожупанску породицу. Уз подршку византијског цара успео је да се врати на власт, али није познато колико дуго је још владао.
Примислав
– велики жупан. Помиње се шездесетих година XII века као рашки велики жупан. Према писању византијског историчара Јована Кинама, који га једини помиње, владао је до 1162. Део историчара сматра да је Примислав уствари Урош II. У супротном реч је о четвртом сину Уроша I.
Белош
– велики жупан. Син Уроша I. Белош је за владе мађарског краља Беле II (1131-1141), чија је жена била његова сестра Јелена, отишао на угарски двор где је заузимао истакнуте положаје. Добио је титулу дукса која је додељивана члановима владајуће династије. Једно време је вршио дужност хрватско-далматинског бана (1144-1157). Постао је 1145. палатин, што је била највећа дворска титула. Био је вешт државник и истакнути војсковођа. Напустио је Угарску после марта 1157. За великог жупана изабран је 1162. После краткотрајне владавине повукао се на своје поседе у Срему, где је основао бенедиктински манастир Св. Стефана. Умро је пре 1198. године.
Деса
– велики жупан. Син Уроша I. Управљао је Зетом и Требињем, а изгледа и Захумљем. Успео је накратко 1155. да дође на великожупански престо. Како није имао подршку византијског цара, на крају је морао да се задовољи пограничном облашћу Дендром (Дубочицом). Цар Манојло I Комнин га је 1162. поставио за великог жупана обавезавши га на верност и враћање Дендре. Деса се повезивао са византијским противницима (Угарска, Венеција, Немачка) због чега је 1163. оптужен за издају, затворен и одведен у Цариград. Изгледа да је касније успео да се избави затвора и врати у Србију.
Тихомир
– велики жупан. Најстарији од четири сина Завиде. Велики жупан је вероватно постао након збацивања Десе 1163. Владао је све док га није збацио млађи брат Стефан Немања.
Стефан Немања
– велики жупан(1166-1196). Оснивач династије Немањић. Рођен је у Рибници у Зети око 1112/1113. као најмлађи син Завиде. Као удеони кнез управљао је жупама Ибром, Расином, Топлицом и Рекама. На власти је био 1168, а највероватније је велики жупан постао још 1166. Немањиним владавином започиње ново доба у историји средњовековне Србије које се огледа у осамостаљивању од Византије, ширењу граница и сређивању унутрашњих прилика. Немања се у великој мери ослањао на цркву. Саградио је више цркава и манастира – Св. Николу и Св. Богородицу у Топлици, Ђурђеве Ступове, Студеницу итд. Богато је даривао цркве у Јерусалиму, Витлејему, Риму, Цариграду и Солуну. Са власти се повукао 1196. и замонашио под именом Симеон. На Свету Гору је, на позив сина Саве, отишао 1197. Ту су њих двојица уз дозволу византијског цара обновила манастир Хиландар у којем је и умро фебруара 1199. Са супругом Аном имао је три сина (Вукана, Стефана и Растка) и три кћери (само Вуки знамо име). Српска црква га је прогласила за свеца.
Стефан Првовенчани
– велики жупан (1196-1217), краљ (1217-1228). Оженио се 1190. Евдокијом, кћерком византијског цара Алексија III Анђела добивши при томе византијско достојанство севастократора. Старији брат Вукан га је збацио с престола 1202. уз помоћ угарског краља Емерика чију врховну власт је признао. Од тада је Србија ушла у угарску краљевску титулу и остала ту све до 1918. Стефан се уз помоћ бугарског цара 1204/5. вратио на престо. Након пада Цариграда 1204. окренуо се западу. Други пут се оженио се Аном, унуком млетачког дужда Дандола. Од папе Хонорија III добио је 1217. краљевску круну, док је његов млађи брат Сава 1219. у Никеји издејствовао аутокефалност српске цркве. Стефан је умро септембра 1228. Претходно се замонашио и узео име Симон. Најпознатија задужбина му је Жича која је постала и седиште српског архиепископа. Написао је Житије Светог Симеона. Имао је четири сина (Радослава, Владислава, Предислава и Уроша) и једну кћерку (Комнину). Српска црква га је прогласила за свеца.
Стефан Радослав
– краљ (1228-1233). Најстарији син Стефан Првовенчаног. Био је ожењен Аном, кћерком епирског цара Теодора I. Од детињства је васпитаван у византијском духу. Уз своје име је додао презиме Дука које је користио у грчким потписима на повељама и натписима на кованом новцу. Свргнут је са престола у јесен 1233. Склонио се најпре у Дубровник, а затим у Драч. Вратио се у Србију где га је Сава замонашио под именом Јован. Умро је после 1235.
Стефан Урош I
– краљ (1243-1277). Најмлађи син Стефана Првовенчаног. Око 1250. оженио се француском принцезом Јеленом са којом је имао три сина (Драгутина, Милутина и Стефана) и две кћерке (Брнчу). На почетку владавине уредио је односе са Дубровником. Успео је да сузбије покушаје Дубровачке архиепископије да римокатоличку организацију у Србији потчини својој власти. Током његове владавине долази до снажног економског јачања Србије, који се огледа пре свега у развоју рударства. Подстицао је насељавање немачких рудара Саса. У спољној политици углавном је иступао у савезу са западним силама против обнове византијске моћи. Старији син Драгутин, зет угарског краља, збацио га је уз помоћ Угарске са престола 1276. Замонашио се под именом Симон. Умро је 1277. Најзначајнија задужбина краља Уроша I су Сопоћани.
Стефан Драгутин
– краљ (1276-1282). Најстарији син краља Уроша I. На престо je дошао збацивши оца. Оженио се 1270. Каталином кћерком угарског краља Стефана V те је понео угарску престолонаследничку титулу младог краља. Имао је два сина (Владислава и Урошица) и пет кћери (Јелисавету, Катарину?, Маргариту?, Урсу?). Најстарија кћерка Јелисавета била је удата за босанског бана Стефана I Котроманића. Након пада са коња код града Јелеча, предао је, на сабору у Дежеву 1282, власт брату Милутину. Од тада је владао областима Ариља, Рудника, Прибоја и пределима северно од Западне Мораве као „сремски краљ“. Од угарског краља је 1284. добио Мачванско-босанску бановину, Усору, Соли и Београд, који се тада први пут нашао под српском влашћу. Пред крај живота се замонашио под именом Теоктист. Умро је марта 1316. Најзначајнија задужбина краља Драгутина је Св. Ахилије у Ариљу. Српска црква га је прогласила за свеца.
Стефан Урош II Милутин
– краљ (1282-1321). Млађи син Уроша I. На власт дошао по споразуму у Дежеву. Женио се пет пута. Имао је два сина (Стефана и Константина) и две кћерке (Ану и Царицу). Са Драгутином је 1291. освојио Браничево са Кучевом. Значајно је проширио српску територију на рачун Византије – освојио је територије северно од линије Охрид-Прилеп-Штип. Уздигао је моћ државе захваљујући снажној привреди, трговини и законодавној делатности. Током Милутинове владавине долази до снажног византијског утицаја у држави и друштву. Подигао је велики број задужбина, између осталих: Грачаницу, цркву Ваведеља Богородичног у Хиландару, цркву Јоакима и Ане у Студеници, Св. Ђорђа у Старом Нагоричану, Св. Стефана у Бањској, Богородицу Љевишку у Призрену. Умро је октобра 1321. Српска црква га је прогласила за свеца.
Стефан Урош III Дечански
– краљ (1321-1331). Најстарији син краља Милутина. Покушао је да 1314. збаци оца са престола, али је поражен, ослепљен и прогнан у Цариград. Вратио се после седам година. Пошто му вид није био трајно оштећен укључио се након Милутинове смрти у борбу за престо из које је изашао као победник. Током његове владавине трајно је изгубљено Захумље које је ушло у састав босанске државе. Код Велбужда 1330. је поразио Бугаре, а потом је освојио више важних утврђења од Византије. Са власти га је 1331. збацио син Душан. Затворен је у Звечан где је убрзо умро. Женио се два пута, Имао је три сина (Душана, Душмана и Симеона) и две кћерке (Јелену и Тодору). Најзначајнија задужбина краља Стефана су Дечани. Српска црква га је прогласила за свеца.
Стефан Урош IV Душан
– краљ (1331-1345), цар (1345-1355). Син Стефана Дечанског и његове прве жене Теодоре, кћерке бугарског цара Смилца. Био је ожењен Јеленом, сестром бугарског цара Ивана Александра Асена, са којом је имао сина Уроша. За време Душанове владавине српска средњовековна држава доживела је највећи територијални обим, привредни и културни успон. Почетком 1333. уступио је Дубровнику Пељешац са Стоном и приморје од Стона до дубровачке границе. Прогласио се за цара на Божић 1345, а свечано крунисао на Ускрс 1346. у Скопљу. Претходно је српска архиепископија уздигнута на ранг патријаршије. Душан је, по угледу на Византију, својим најближим сарадницима доделио највиша царска достојанства деспота, севастократора и кесара, увео византијски церемонијал и организацију државне управе. Извршио је кодификацију права 1349. и 1354. (Душанов законик). Душаново царство се простирало од Саве и Дунава на северу до Ахаје на југу, и од долине Месте на истоку до Дрине и Дубровника на западу. Умро је крајем 1355. Попут претходника помагао је, бранио и штитио цркву. Душанова главна задужбина је манастир Св. Арханђела код Призрена. Богато је даривао светогорске манастире, као и Св. Арханђеле у Јерусалиму, Св. Николу у Барију.
Стефан Урош V
– цар (1355-1371). Син цара Душана. Приликом очевог крунисања за цара био је одређен за савладара и наследника и добио је краљевску круну. Наследио је велику, али недовољно хомогенизовану државу која је постепено почела да се распада на територије обласних господара. Септембра 1365. прогласио је Вукашина Мрњавчевића за савладара и доделио му краљевску титулу, а његовом брату Угљеши титулу деспота. Цар Урош је умро крајем 1371. Био је ожењен Аном, кћерком влашког кнеза Александра. Смрћу цара Уроша угашена је лоза Немањића. Српска црква га је прогласила за свеца.
Лазар
– кнез Моравске Србије. Отац му је служио код цара Душана као логотет, док је Лазар код оба цара био ставилац. Био је ожењен Милицом, кћерком великог кнеза Вратка који је наводно био потомак Немањиног сина Вукана. Са њом је имао два сина (Стефана и Вука) и пет кћери (Мару, Иливеру, Драгану, Теодору и Јелену). Временом је израстао у најмоћнијег обласног господара. Играо је значајну улогу приликом измирења Цариградске и Пећке патријаршије 1375, што му је донело подршку цркве. Његова област простирала се у сливу Западне Мораве. Политичке односе продубио је орођавањем са околним владарима и великашима. Кћерке је удао за Александра, сина бугарског цара Шишмана, мачванског бана Николу Горјанског Млађег, Вука Бранковића и Ђурђа Стратимировића Балшића. Погинуо је 28. јуна 1389. у Косовском боју. Најзначајнија задужбина кнеза Лазара је манастир Раваница. Српска црква га је прогласила за свеца.
Стефан Лазаревић
– кнез (1389-1402), деспот (1402-1427). До 1393. (до пунолетства) у његово име владала је мајка Милица. Као турски вазал учествовао је у биткама на Ровинама (1395), Никопољу (1396) и Ангори (1402). Византијски цар Јован VII Палеолог доделио му је 1402. титулу деспота. Искористио је сукобе око престола у Турској да се окрене Угарској поставши њен вазал (1403). За узврат је добио Београд који постаје нова престоница Србије (све до 1427). Уговором са султаном Мехмедом I (1413-1421) обезбедио је мир који је трајао све до пред његову смрт. Захваљујући томе долази до привредног и друштвеног развоја Деспотовине. Био је члан витешког Змајевог реда који је основао угарски краљ 1408. На сабору 1426. за свог наследника одредио је Ђурђа Бранковића. Умро је јула 1427. од срчане капи. Био је ожењен Јеленом, кћерком Франческа Гатилузија господара Митилене. Најзначајнија задужбина му је манастир Ресава (Манасија). Бавио се књижевношћу. Најзначајнија дела су му Натпис на стубу косовском и Слово љубве. Српска црква га је прогласила за свеца.
Ђурађ Бранковић
– деспот (1427-1456). Син Вука Бранковића и Маре, кћерке кнеза Лазара. Најпре је владао облашћу која је обухватала Косово и Метохију, део Полимља и Пештерске висоравни. Женио се двапут: први пут именом непознатом сестром трапезунтског цара Јована IV Комнина, а други пут Јерином (Ирином), кћерком Теодора Кантакузина. Имао је четири сина (Тодора, Гргура, Стефана и Лазара) и три кћерке (Јелену, Мару и Катарину). Преузео је деспотски престо након смрти деспота Стефана. На почетку своје владавине сазидао је град Смедерево, нову престоницу српске државе (1430). Турци су 1439. заузели Деспотовину. Због отпора који је пружао султан му је ослепео синове Гргура и Стефана. Обновио је државу 1444. уз угарску помоћ. Након тога је владао као веран турски султан. Турци од 1454. постепено освајају Деспотовину. Наредне године су заузели њен јужни део чиме је прекинута веза са Зетом. Деспот Ђурађ је умро крајем 1456.
Лазар Бранковић
– деспот (1456-1458). Најмлађи син деспота Ђурђа Бранковића. Био је ожењен Јеленом, кћерком морејског деспота Томе Палеолога, са којом је имао три кћерке (Јелену, Ирину и Миулицу). Током његове кратке владавине Деспотовина је била пред падом исцрпљена дугогодишњом борбом са Турцима, глађу и епидемијама. Да би обезбедио опстанак склопио је 1457. мир са турским султаном којим му је била загарантована цела Деспотовина осим Новог Брда. После његове смрти 20. јануара 1458. у име његове кћерке владало је намесништво.
Стефан Бранковић
– деспот (март 1458 – април 1459). Син деспота Ђурђа. Био је слеп те по средњовековним правилима није могао бити на престолу. Зато је оца наследио млађи брат Лазар. После смрти брата био је члан Намесништва које је управљало земљом. Деспотску титулу и српско начелство примио је од угарског краља. Протеран је након што се босански краљевић Стефан оженио Лазаревом кћерком Јеленом. Био је ожењен Ангелином, кћерком Аријанита Комнина, са којом је имао два сина (Ђорђа и Јована) и једну кћерку (Марију). Српска црква га је прогласила за свеца.

НА ЧЕЛУ (ЈУГОСЛАВИЈЕ) 1804-2014. ГОДИНЕ
Карађорђе Петровић
, вожд (1804-1813). Рођен је у шумадијском селу Вишевцу 1762. Пре него што је изабран за предводника Првог српског устанка на збору у Орашцу у фебруару 1804. учестовао је у аустријско-турском рату (1788-1791) тзв. Кочиној крајини, а после тога био је трговац стоком и један од најугледнијих људи у Шумадији. Успешно је предводио устаничку војску у готово свим биткама за време Првог српског устанка (Дрлупа, Иванковац, Мишар, Делиград, Суводол, Варварин и Лозница). Против опозиције борио се до 1811. када је сузбио њен утицај. Родоначелник је династије Карађорђевић када му је 1808. признато право наследства. Дипломатија је била слабија страна његове владавине. Напустио је Србију 1813. и прешао у Аустрију, па 1814. у Русију. У намери да у савезу са хетеријом покрене нови устанак прешао је у Србију где је убијен 1817. у Радовањском лугу.
Милош Обреновић
, кнез Србије (1815-1839).Рођен је у Средњој Добрињи у Ужичкој нахији 1783. Уз полубрата Милана Обреновића ратовао је у Првом српском устанку и наметнуо се за војводу. Заједно са Турцима учествовао је у гушењу Хаџи-Проданове буне 1814. За предводника Другог српског устанка изабран је на збору у Такову 1815. Предводио је устаничку војску у биткама на Љубићу, Палежу, Пожаревцу и Дубљу. У јесен 1815. споразумео се са турским везиром Марашли Али-пашом, чиме је Други српски устанак примирен. У првим годинама владавине сурово је сузбијао опозицију. Уз помоћ руске дипломатије израдио је да Порта 1830. призна аутономију Србије, а мимо руске подршке потврђен је за владара са наследним достојанством. Родоначелник је династије Обреновић. Успео је да Порта 1833. призна границе Србије из Првог српског устанка. Под притиском опозције, која је своје идеје уградила у Устав из 1838, напустио је Србију 1839.
Милан Обреновић
, кнез Србије (1839). Најстарији син кнеза Милоша, рођен у Крагујевцу 1819. На престо је ступио после очеве абдикације, иако већ тешко болестан. Већи део своје „владавине” од 25 дана прележао је у кревету, па иза њега није остао ниједан потписан документ. Због његовог тешког здравственог стања Државни савет је образовао намесништво у којем су били Аврам Петронијевић, Јеврем Обреновић и Тома Вучић Перишић (јун 1839 - март 1840). Наследио га је млађи брат Михаило који је у то време био са оцем, кнезом Милошем, па је намесништво остало на власти до Михаиловог повратка у земљу у марту 1840.
Михаило Обреновић
, кнез Србије (1839-1842).Млађи син кнеза Милоша, рођен је у Крагујевцу 1823. Власт је преузео од Намесништва по повратку у земљу у марту 1840. Његова прва владавина протекла је у борби са опозицијом-устваборанитељима који су га Вучићевом буном из 1842. прогнали са власти. Боравак у емиграцији искористио је за додатано образовање и путовања по Европи, што му је омогућило да стечена искуства примени у време друге владе.
Александар Карађорђевић
, кнез Србије (1842-1858).Рођен је у Тополи 1806, а Србију је напустио 1813. Младост је провео у Русији. У земљу се вратио 1840. и постао је ађутант кнеза Михаила. На власт су га превратом из 1842. довели уставобранитељи. Два пута је биран за кнеза. Први пут на скупштини која је одржана на Врачару у септембру 1842, а други пут, услед притиска Русије која је његов избор сматрала револуционарним чином, на скупштини у Топчидеру у јуну 1843. Србијом је владао као изборни кнез. Његова владавина је значајана по низу закона којима је утемљен правни поредак у Србији, али и оснажен бирократски апарат. Водио је опрезну спољну политику, којом су у његово име руководили Аврам Петронијевић и Илија Гарашанин. Сачувао је неутралност Србије у Кримском рату (1853-1856). Пред крај владавине главни спољнополитички савезник постала му је Аустрија. Група саветника у јесен 1857. припремала је атентат на њега (Тенкина завера). Завера је откривена, али је означила почетак краја његове владавине.
Милош Обреновић
, кнез Србије (1858-1860). По други пут на власт је дошао одлуком Светоандрејске скупштине која је одржана у Београду у децембру 1858. Славодобитно је дочекан у Србији. Обрачунао се са политичким противницима и настојао је да промени Устав из 1838, поврати наследно кнежевско достајанство својој породици и да протера преостале Турке из Србије. Наставио је са аполутистичким начином владавине, због чега је од себе одбио либерале. Преминуо је у Београду 1860.
Михаило Обреновић
, кнез Србије (1860-1868). По други пут на престо је ступио после очеве смрти у септембру 1860. Његова друга владавина обележена је реформама у унутрашњој управи (закон о централној управи, војсци, основним школама..), а на спољном плану образовао је Балкански савез у намери да се поведе рат против Турака. Најзначајнија тековина његове владавине је протеривање турских гарнизона из Србији 1867. Владавина просвећеног апсолутисте како је представљана друга кнез Михаилова владавина наишла је на отпор либерала и омладине (Уједињена омладина српска). Убијен је у атенату у јуну 1868. Пошто у браку са мађарском племкињом Јулијом Хуњади није имао порода, за кнеза Србије проглашен је Милан Обреновић.
Милан Обреновић
, кнез Србије (1872-1882), краљ (1882-1889). Рођен је у Манасији у данашњој Румунији 1852. Са њим је почела владавине бочне лозе Обреновића, пошто је он био унук Јеврема Обреновића, кнез Милошевог брата. Будући да је на престо Србије ступио са 14 година образовано је намесништво (Миливоје Петровић Блазнавац, Јован Ристић и Јован Гавриловић) које је владало до 1872. Намесништво је 1869. донело нови устав. У време Велике источне кризе (1875-1878) увео је Србију у рат. У првом рату 1876/77. Србија је поражена, али је у другом 1877/78. стекла територијално проширење на југу и југоистоку. На Берлинском конгресу 1878. Србији је призната независност. Од 1879. повео је аустрофилску политику, па је 1881. потписао Тајну конвенцију, а 1882. уз подршку Аустро-Угарске прогласио се за краља. Радикали су представљали снажну опозицију и са њима се бескомпромисно обрачунао у време Тимочке буне 1883. У јесен 1885. објавио је рат Бугарској, али је Србија у том рату поражена. Био је приморан на доношење Устава 1888. којим је заведен парламентаризам у Србији. Абдицирао је 1889. после чега је повремено узимао учешћа у политичком животу. Умро је Бечу 1901.
Александар Обреновић
, краљ Србије (1893-1903). Рођен је у Београду 1876. На престо је, попут његовог оца, ступио као малолетник, због чега је поново образовано намесништво (1889-1893) које су првобитно чинили Јован Ристић, Коста Протић и Јован Белимарковић. Иако не без политичког талента, његова владавина обележена је унутрашњим политичким потресима. Власт је преузео државним ударом 1893. када је пре пунолества сменио намесништво и преузео краљевску власт. Наредне 1894. укинуо је Устав из 1888. и на снагу вратио Намеснички устав из 1869. Настојао је да међупартијске сукобе у Србији неутралише формирањем тзв. неутралних влада. Његова женидба са удовицом Драгом Машин (рођена Луњевица) с негодовањем је прихваћена у јавном мнењу. Новим, Октроисаним уставом из 1901. уведен је дводомни парламентарни систем у Србији. Убијен је 11. јуна 1903. у завери коју су сковали официри предвођени Драгутином Димитријевић Аписом (Мајски преврат). Са њим се угасила владавина династије Обреновић.
Петар I Карађорђевић
, краљ Србије (1903-1918), краљ Краљевине СХС (1918-1921). Рођен је у Београду 1844. Школовао се у Француској и Швајцарској. Учествовао је у француско-пруском рату (1870/71) и босанском устанку 1875/76. под именим Петар Мркоњић. На краљевски престо Србије изабрала га је Народна скупштина после Мајског преврата 1903. Његова владавина 1903-1914. сматра се златним добом демократије у Србији, која је оснажена враћањем на снагу Устава из 1888. Успешно је одолео притисцима Аустро-Угарске у време Царинског рата (1906-1911) и Анексионе кризе (1908/9). Командовао је српском војском у Балканским ратовима (1912/13), због чега је добио епитет Ослободилац. Због слабог здравља у јуну 1914. пренео је краљевска овлашћења на сина, регента Александра. Учестововао је у повлачењу српске војске преко Албаније. Преминуо је у Београду 1921.
Александар I Карађорђевић
, краљ Краљевине СХС/Југославије (1921-1934). Рођен је на Цетињу 1888. За наследника престола Србије проглашен је 1909. У Првом балканском рату командовао је І српском армијом, 24. јуна 1914. постао је регент Краљевине Србије, а од 1. децембра 1918. и Краљевства Срба Хрвата и Словенаца. Носио је епитет Ујединитељ. Стварањем југословенске државе учињен је раскид са дотадашњим државотворним развојем Србије. После очеве смрти преузео је краљевску власт. Покушавао је да избалансираном политиком сузбије сепаратистичке тежње хрватске политичке елите, па како у томе није успео, извршио је државни удар 6. јануара 1929. Унитаристичком и централистичком политиком и идеологијом интегралног југословенства тежио је да оствари снажно државно јединство као нужан предуслов националне интеграције Југословена. Краљевина СХС је у октобру 1929. променила име у Краљевина Југославија. Снажан централистички курс ослабио је после доношења Октроисаног устава 1931. којим је поново уведен дводомни парламентарни систем. У међународним односима између два светска рата Југославија је захваљујући њему била стамени члан тзв. Версајског поретка, те члан Мале Антанте и Балканског пакта. Убијен је у атентату у Марсељу 9. окобра 1934.
Петар ІІ Карађорђевић
, краљ Југославије (1934-1945). Рођен је у Београду 1923. На престо је ступио 1934, па пошто је био малолетан образовано је намесништво које су чинили кнез Павле Карађорђевић, Раденко Станковић и Иво Перовић. Намесништво је управљало земљом од 1934. до 1941. Државним ударом 27. марта 1941. проглашен је пунолетним. Напустио је земљу у току агресије Немачке и њених савезника априла 1941. и склонио се у Грчку, па у Египат и коначно у Енглеску. Подржавао је антифашистички покрет Драгољуба Драже Михаиловића у земљи, али је под притиском Велике Британије 1944. дао подршку Јосипу Брозу Титу и партизанском покрету. Комунистичка скупштина (АВНОЈ) на заседању у Јајцу 1943. забранила му је повратак у земљу. У марту 1945. краљевска овлашћења пренео је на трочлано намесништво. Уставотворна скупштина је 29. новембра 1945. укинула монархију. Умро је у САД 1970.
Јосип Броз Тито
, председник Југославије (1944-1980). Рођен је у Кумровцу у хрватском Загорју 1892. Политичку каријеру, руковођен искуствима бољшевичке револуције у Русији, градио је као члан, а потом као руководилац Комунустичке партије Југославије. После немачког напада на Југосавију 1941. дошао је у Београд. У борбу против окупатора активно се укључио после напада сила Осовине на СССР 22. јуна 1941. Командовао је партизанским покретом отпора и из рата је изашао са чином маршала. Владао је југословенском федерацијом прво као председник владе (1945-1953) а потом као председник (1953-1980). Иако је за време његове владавине остварен неспоран напредак на пољу образовања, здравствене заштите и животног стандарда, његова владавина је представљала револуционаран раскид са дотадашњим друштвеним развојем Србије, док је у политичком погледу Србија Уставом из 1974. постала најслабији члан југословенске федерације.
Уставом СР Србије од 25. фебруара 1974. уведено је колективно Председништво Србије из чијих редова су се бирали председници Председништва до 1989.

Events
Commentary by Aide to the President Yury Ushakov following a telephone conversation between Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump
December 29, 2025
19:30
Aide to the President
Yury Ushakov
Ushakov Yury
Aide to the President
:
Colleagues,
Since it is December 29 today, and the New Year is just round the corner, an interesting – from a political point
of view too – detail can be mentioned: in the outgoing year, President Vladimir
Putin held 17 contacts with US representatives. This includes a visit to Alaska, ten telephone conversations with
Donald Trump
Trump Donald
President of the United States of America
, and six meetings with
his special envoys. What does this mean? You can draw your own conclusions. Now
to the telephone conversation.
As agreed earlier, another telephone
conversation took place today between the presidents of Russia and the United
States. Donald Trump and his key advisers who were present during the call
provided a detailed briefing on the main outcomes of yesterday’s talks with the Ukrainian delegation at Mar-a-Lago.
In their presentation, that is, the American presentation, during these talks the US side took an assertive stance
in promoting the idea that Kiev needs to take real steps towards the final
settlement of the conflict instead of using demands for a temporary ceasefire
as cover. Zelensky was advised to not even try to secure a respite for his
armed forces but instead focus on achieving a comprehensive agreement that
would lead to the actual end to the armed conflict.
Donald Trump informed [the President
of Russia] about certain results achieved by Zelensky’s team precisely in this direction,
but which nevertheless, in our assessment, still leave the Kiev authorities
room for various interpretations in order to evade fulfilment of their commitments.
And of course, Vladimir Putin drew
attention of his counterpart Donald Trump to the fact that practically
immediately after what the US side considers a successful round of talks at Mar-a-Lago, the Kiev regime carried out a terrorist attack involving a barrage of long-range unmanned aerial vehicles, an attack on the state residence of the President of Russia in the Novgorod Region.
The Russian side clearly stated that
such reckless terrorist acts will, of course, not go unanswered and will meet
with the most serious response.
The US President was shocked by this
information, literally outraged. He said that he could not even imagine such irrational
actions. And, as was stated, this will undoubtedly affect the approaches of the United States in the context of working with Zelensky, to whom the current
administration, as Donald Trump himself said, did not, thankfully, give
Tomahawks.
Vladimir Putin emphasised that the Russian side intends to continue close and productive work with its US partners
in searching for ways to achieve peace. However, naturally, with regard to a number of agreements reached at the previous stage and the newly outlined solutions,
Russia’s position will be revised. This was stated very clearly, and the Americans should treat this with understanding. Since Kiev is using the state
terrorism, the Russian side cannot act otherwise.
Such was the nature of the conversation, at the end of which both presidents, in a very friendly manner,
agreed to maintain dialogue onwards.
Thank you very much.

TITLE: Meeting with Moscow Region Governor Andrei Vorobyov • President of Russia

Events
Meeting with Moscow Region Governor Andrei Vorobyov
Vladimir Putin held a working meeting with Governor of the Moscow Region Andrei Vorobyov.
December 29, 2025
14:00
Andrei Vorobyov began his report
with the modernisation of infrastructure, including heat, power, and water
supply noting that the region’s population is growing and now stands at about
nine million people. A major national environmental project is being
implemented. Around 30 large water treatment plants are being built in the region. Another important aspect concerns the introduction of modern sensors
and technologies that make it possible to anticipate declines in certain
parameters. To this end, dispatcher services are being fully transformed. The goal
is to significantly renovate heat, water supply and water disposal, as well as power
supply over the next three years.
The Governor also noted that together
with Gazprom, the region continues to develop its gas infrastructure. This
project is very much sought after.
Noting that he heads the State
Council Commission on Data Economy, Andrei Vorobyov informed the President about
an experiment to introduce artificial intelligence, conducted jointly with the federal Government, which is designed, in particular, to reduce reporting
requirements. The experiment was a success. The point is that reporting and the number of documents is halved and several agencies are brought together within
unified reporting requirements and operate on a shared platform. Andrei
Vorobyov asked the President to support extending the experiment to 44
agencies. The President supported this proposal.
Overall, in the field of AI
implementation, the region started out with 13 projects and now operates 42. In particular, this makes it possible to save funds and provide services faster
and at a lower cost.
The Governor also reported that the creation of industrial parks in the region continues. There are eight such
locations in the Moscow Region. He noted that despite the existing challenges,
the parks get populated, and residents are ready to invest in aircraft
manufacturing, pumps, and robotics.
Andrei Vorobyov also spoke about engagement
with participants in the special military operation and their families, as well
as about four rehabilitation centres in the region. Similar to the Time of Heroes federal programme, a regional project, the Heroes of the Moscow Region, is
being implemented.
The Governor also answered the President’s question
about social coordinators who work with veterans of the special military
operation and their families. According to Andrei Vorobyov, there are 80 social
coordinators in the region. They provide ongoing support to their wards that live
in different parts of the Moscow Region. This institution has a proven track record.
A total of 35,000 people have applied to the Defenders of the Fatherland
Foundation. The President suggested paying particular attention to the issues of most concern for those who have returned from the combat zone and their family
members, such as various types of payments, legal assistance, and other support
measures. Vladimir Putin asked the Governor to monitor these matters at all
times.

Yury
Ushakov
Ushakov Yury
Aide to the President
: President Vladimir Putin has just finished his telephone conversation
with President of the United States
Donald Trump
Trump Donald
President of the United States of America
.
The conversation took place at the US President’s initiative. The US
President wished to discuss the current developments in the context of the Ukrainian conflict and its potential resolution with the President of Russia.
President Trump wished to discuss these matters before his in-person meeting
with Zelensky later today at Mar-a-Lago, Florida.
Logically, at the beginning of the conversation that continued for 1
hour and 15 minutes, the presidents exchanged warm Christmas and New Year
greetings and, naturally, wished happiness to both nations. The rest of the conversation was similarly friendly, good-natured and business-like, with mutual
interest in making progress towards a long-term resolution of the Ukrainian
conflict.
Donald Trump paid
close attention to Russia’s assessment of the realistic prospects for an agreement, and to our President’s detailed rationale for the fundamental
importance of continuing to build upon the Russian-American understandings
established during the Anchorage
summit
and the numerous subsequent contacts
between the two administrations.
Most significantly,
the Russian and US presidents share a broadly similar view that the temporary
ceasefire proposed by Ukraine and Europe – under the pretext of preparing for a referendum or other such measures – would merely prolong the conflict and risk
a renewed escalation on the battlefield. A definitive cessation of hostilities
requires, first and foremost, a bold and responsible political decision from
Kiev, one that aligns with the ongoing discussions through the Russian-American
channel. Given the evolving situation on the front lines, it would be in the Ukrainian regime’s interest to make such a decision regarding Donbass without
further delay.
Donald Trump
repeatedly emphasised the necessity of ending the war as swiftly as possible
and spoke of the impressive prospects for economic cooperation between the United States and both Russia and Ukraine that would open up once the hostilities are over. He acknowledged that the Ukrainian crisis has been his
most formidable foreign policy challenge, stating that he now saw renewed proof
of Russia’s commitment to a political and diplomatic settlement. It is with
this understanding that he intends to frame his forthcoming negotiations with
Zelensky.
It is particularly
noteworthy that during today’s conversation, the Russian President acceded to the American proposal to continue efforts to resolve the Ukrainian situation
through two specially established working groups. One will address various
security dimensions, and the other, economic matters. The terms for launching
these working groups will be finalised in the near future, most likely in early
January.
Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump agreed to speak
again by telephone promptly after the US President’s meeting with the Ukrainian
delegation at Mar-a-Lago this evening.

President
of Russia Vladimir Putin:
Good afternoon, comrades.
We are
holding a regular meeting on the developments in the special military
operation. I know that you have things to report and some good news and results
for the public. We will certainly discuss them and will consider subsequent
short-term tasks.
I would
like to hear reports from the commanders of the Centre and East groups, on the situation in the respective front sectors and on the performance of your
subordinate troops.
As we
established during previous similar meetings, I would like to ask the Chief of the General Staff to report on the overall situation at the front line.
Mr
Gerasimov, please.
Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov:
Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
The Joint Force troops are advancing
in all sectors. The Ukrainian armed forces command is making unsuccessful
attempts to stop our advance.
The North group formations continue
to carry out missions to establish a safety zone in borderline areas of the Sumy and Kharkov regions of Ukraine. In the past two weeks, we have taken
control of Vysokoye in the Sumy Region, as well as Vilcha and Prilipka in the Kharkov Region.
Forces of the West group are
currently eliminating enemy units that have been encircled on the left bank of the Oskol River east of Kupyansk.
Novoplatonovka, located in the southern reaches of the Oskol River, has been liberated, and we are completing
the mop-up operation in Boguslavka.
An enemy formation has been
encircled in Drobyshevo in the Krasny Liman sector, and it is currently being
eliminated. Our units are fighting in the south-eastern and eastern sectors of Krasny Liman.
After liberating Seversk, the South group
is advancing rapidly towards Slavyansk. We have liberated Kirovo. Street
fighting continues in Konstantinovka. We
have taken control of 50 percent of the city’s residential areas.
Units of the Centre group have
completely defeated an encircled formation of the Ukrainian armed forces and have liberated the city of Dimitrov. The East group of forces is advancing
westwards in the Zaporozhye Region as well as in the Dnepropetrovsk Region, and its units aim to establish a safety zone there.
We have liberated the city of Gulyaipolye. In the past two weeks, we have taken control of five more
communities in these sectors. We continue to expand a bridgehead on the west
bank of the Gaichur River.
Assault units of the Dnieper group
are advancing in the Zaporozhye sector; they have liberated Stepnogorsk and are
finishing off enemy formations in Primorskoye and Lukyanovskoye.
Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
The Joint Force troops will continue
to liberate Donbass, as well as the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions.
This concludes my report.
Vladimir Putin
: Thank you, Mr Gerasimov.
I can see that all our objectives are being accomplished
in accordance with the concept of the special military operation approved and developed by the General Staff. Indeed, the safety zone is being created at a good
pace in the border areas of the Sumy, Kharkov and Dnepropetrovsk regions. The offensive
in Donbass and the Zaporozhye Region is going on across the entire line of contact. Russian troops are increasing their pressure on the Ukrainian armed forces.
I suggest we begin with the Centre group of forces. Mr Solodchuk, I ask you to report on the situation in your area of responsibility.
Please.
Commander of the Centre Group of Forces Valery
Solodchuk
: Comrade Supreme
Commander-in-Chief,
The troops of the Centre group continue to fulfil
the tasks of defeating the enemy in their zone of responsibility in compliance
with the approved concept.

Army have finished destroying
Ukrainian armed forces’ units in the city of Dimitrov thereby completely
liberating the city. At present our forces finalise the mopping-up of the city blocks,
evacuating the peaceful population and taking measures to stabilise the situation around Dimitrov and Krasnoarmeysk.
In addition, the 9
th
Motor Rifle brigade
liberated the city of Rodinskoye to the north of the Krasnoarmeysk-Dimitrov
agglomeration, liberated Volnoye community and continue combat actions in Sukhetskoye and Novy Donbass populated centres.
The 2
nd
Army formations are engaged in screening in Krasnoarmeysk and developing the offensive northward. They have evacuated
over 1,100 peaceful residents.
Assault units of the 41
st
Army are advancing
in Grishino. The enemy uses this populated centre to concentrate reserves and conduct
attacks on the north-western part of Krasnoarmeysk but fails to achieve any
results.
The enemy loses from 60 to 120˗140 infantrymen
every day in three areas: Grishino, the north-western outskirts of Krasnoarmeysk, Shevchenko in the direction of Krasnoarmeysk, Sergeyevka in the direction of Krasnoarmeysk, and Kotlino. The infantry is continuously moving
towards these centres. It should be noted that these are elite units of the Ukrainian armed forces: the 82
nd
Airborne Assault Brigade and the 95
th
Airborne Assault Brigade, which ingloriously sustain losses, achieving nothing
there.
In the Oktyabrsk area we have liberated Artemovka,
an important populated centre. It is one of the key areas for further advance to the north with a view to encircle the enemy’s strategic defence line that runs across
Konstantinovka, Druzhkovka, Kramatorsk and Slavyansk, to envelop the western
area.
We are also developing offensive in the Dnepropetrovsk
Region, where we fulfil your instructions on creating a safety zone with the Donetsk People’s Republic. The 90
th
Tank Division, in conjunction with
the 41
st
Army are liberating Novopavlovka. Fighting in Novopodgorodnoye
continues.
Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
All the tasks put before the group will be
accomplished. This concludes my report.
Vladimir Putin
: Thank you, Mr Gerasimov.
I can see that all our objectives are being accomplished
in accordance with the concept of the special military operation approved and developed by the General Staff. Indeed, the safety zone is being created at a good
pace in the border areas of the Sumy, Kharkov and Dnepropetrovsk regions. The offensive
in Donbass and the Zaporozhye Region is going on across the entire line of contact. Russian troops are increasing their pressure on the Ukrainian armed forces.
I suggest we begin with the Centre group of forces. Mr Solodchuk, I ask you to report on the situation in your area of responsibility.
Please.
Commander of the Centre Group of Forces Valery
Solodchuk
: Comrade Supreme
Commander-in-Chief,
The troops of the Centre group continue to fulfil
the tasks of defeating the enemy in their zone of responsibility in compliance
with the approved concept.

Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
All the tasks put before the group will be
accomplished. This concludes my report.
Vladimir Putin:
Thank you, Mr Solodchuk.
You mentioned the successful actions
of the 5
th
Motor Rifle Brigade. Colonel Ramil Faskhutdinov joins us from
the forward command post of the brigade. Mr Faskhutdinov, can you hear us?
Brigade Commander Ramil Faskhutdinov:
Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
Brigade Commander Colonel
Faskhutdinov. Good afternoon, I hear you perfectly well.
Vladimir Putin:
Excellent. Please report on the situation in the city, the assault details,
and the current state of affairs.
Ramil Faskhutdinov:
Here is my report, Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief.
From September 6 to December 26, the brigade units took on the tasks of liberating the city of Dimitrov. Based on the situation at hand, the operation was divided into three phases.
During the first phase from
September 6 to 30, the brigade’s reconnaissance battalion breached enemy defences,
using the element of surprise and the result of the fire damage, and advanced almost
one kilometre into the enemy territory, creating a bridgehead in the city. We
managed to gain a foothold on the northeastern outskirts along Mira and Koshevogo
streets. The assault groups went into action simultaneously from different
directions misleading the enemy and preventing them from identifying the direction
of the primary attack.
During the second phase from October 1 to November 22, in order to block the enemy’s supply routes in the city,
assault units of the 1
st
and 3
rd
battalions took control
of the forest belts and a treatment plant north of Dimitrov, thereby cutting
off all connection with the encircled enemy group. The assault units took
advantage of the newly taken grounds and suitable weather conditions to make a dash
to the southeastern outskirts of the city. Following unrelenting assault efforts,
the southern part of Dimitrov was fully liberated by the end of November 22.
During the third phase that lasted from
November 23 to December 27, assault units of the 1
st
and 3
rd
motor rifle battalions were put into action, and by December 7 the brigade had
secured key positions in the city’s central quarters and continued eliminating
encircled enemy.
Today, December 27, the brigade
completely defeated the Ukrainian army formation in the city. The city of Dimitrov has been fully liberated. At present, buildings, structures,
basements, and residential quarters are being inspected. Small scattered enemy
groups are being identified and destroyed. We have begun demining streets and buildings and providing medical help and humanitarian aid to the local population.
Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
Right now, commander of the 1
st
Motor Rifle Company Senior Lieutenant Vladimir Silenko, whose unit took part in liberating the city, is on the line from Dimitrov. I need your permission to give
him the floor to speak.
Vladimir Putin:
Yes, of course.
Please, Mr Silenko, go ahead.
Commander of the 1
st
Motor Rifle Company Senior Lieutenant
Vladimir Silenko:
Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
I am the commander of the 1
st
company of the 1
st
battalion of the 5
th
brigade. I am now
in the city of Dimitrov near the Viktorovskaya Church.
As of December 27, the city is under
our control; the mop-up of the city is almost complete. We are providing
humanitarian aid and medical help to civilians, building defences, and are ready
to carry out further combat missions.
On behalf of the entire brigade, I would like to extend my best wishes to you on the occasion of the upcoming New
Year and wish you good health and peaceful sky. Victory will be ours!
Vladimir Putin:
Thank you very much, comrades, for your highly effective combat operations and the results. I would also like to congratulate
Ramil Faskhutdinov, and you, Mr Silenko, and all our officers and soldiers who
displayed bravery and heroism, competent command of the troops and very timely
adoption of the necessary decisions. I know, and the Chief of the General Staff
reported that you showed ingenuity and courage. Thank you very much.
In turn, I would like to convey my best wishes on the upcoming New Year. Congratulations, everyone, and thank you.
And now, let us discuss the situation in the East group’s zone of responsibility. Mr Ivanayev, you have the floor.
Commander of the East Group of Forces
Andrei Ivanayev:
Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
The East group of forces continues
to accomplish its missions in the Zaporozhye sector.
Its units have crossed the Gaichur
River and are advancing westwards in the Zaporozhye Region. By the end of December 26, assault units of the 57
th
and 60
th
motor rifle
brigades of the 5
th
Army completely liberated the city of Gulyaipolye. The enemy turned the city’s residential quarters into a fortified
area. It took us 20 days to breach the enemy’s multilayered defences. We have taken
complete control of Gulyaipolye and are now searching for and destroying individual
groups of the Ukrainian armed forces.
Formations of the 36
th
Army have breached enemy defences on the western bank of the Gaichur River, and they are advancing in the Zaporozhye Region towards major enemy logistics hubs.
They have penetrated enemy positions by over seven kilometres.
The 29
th
Army is
advancing in the southern sector of the Dnepropetrovsk Region and continues to expand the safety zone. Since early December, the group has taken control of more
than 210 square kilometres in the Dnepropetrovsk and Zaporozhye regions, we
have liberated ten communities, including four in the Dnepropetrovsk Region and six in the Zaporozhye Region.
Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
we are destroying enemy formations in the group’s zone of responsibility in accordance with the approved plan. The East group of forces continues to advance.
This concludes my report.
Vladimir Putin:
Mr Ivanayev, as far as I understand, the Commander of the 57
th
Motor Rifle Brigade Colonel Vyacheslav
Vedenin is now on the line.
Andrei Ivanayev:
Yes, sir.
Vladimir Putin:
Mr Vedenin, can you hear and see
us?
Commander of the 57
th
Motor Rifle Brigade Vyacheslav Vedenin:
Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
Commander of the 57
th
brigade
Colonel Vedenin here. Good afternoon, sir. I can hear and copy you very well.
Vladimir Putin:
Excellent. Mr Vedenin, please
report on the situation in Gulyaipolye.
Vyacheslav Vedenin
: Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
The 57
th
Brigade of the 5
th
Army is engaged in the offensive on the left flank in the Vremevka area in the assigned zone of advance.
On December 7, I received the task to launch the offensive in conjunction with the 60
th
Motor Rifle Brigade in the direction of Yablokovo and Gulyaipole and liberate Gulyaipole by the end of December 26.
On December 5, using harsh weather, the fog, the advance parties of the assault squad crossed the Gaichur River and instantly captured
a section of the Bolshaya, Mirnaya and Peschanaya streets thereby creating a bridgehead on the left bank of the Gaichur River and splitting the central and eastern parts of Gulyaipole thus providing for the engagement in combat of the main forces.
On December 7, the first echelon units of the 1
st
Motor Rifle Battalion forced a three-point crossing over the Gaichur River and gained a foothold in the streets of Gulyaipole. They destroyed the 225
th
Assault Regiment of the 102
nd
Territorial Defence Brigade and the 154
th
Separate Mechanised Brigade to completely liberate the southeastern
part of Gulyaipole by the end of the 10
th
day. We took enemy’s defended
points, mopped up about 1,600 buildings and destroyed up to 400 Ukrainian
militants.
Further, having increased our efforts by engaging
the 2
nd
and 3
rd
battalions in the direction of the primary
attack from south to north and attacking along the Gaichur River and the Bolshaya Street as well as across the western part of Gulyaipole, we reached
the Shevchenko Street simultaneously with the 60
th
Brigade thus
blocking the enemy in Gulyaipole by completely cutting off all ammunition and evacuation routes.
Later, drawing a noose, we blocked the city’s high-rise
development, gradually mopping up the single-family neighbourhood in Gulyaipole
and destroying the defending enemy from the 225
th
Separate Assault
Regiment and the 333
rd
Separate Assault Regiment block by block.
By the end of December 26, our brigade finished
clearing Gulyaipolye and the city is now under our control. Currently, the brigade
units are re-checking buildings and basements in order to eliminate individual
Ukrainian soldiers who may still be hiding in the urban area, as well as providing assistance to the civilian population or evacuating them, if needed.
Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
The 57
th
Brigade continues to fulfil
combat missions to liberate the Zaporozhye Region. All the assigned tasks will be
accomplished.
This concludes my report.
Vladimir Putin
: Thank you, Mr Vedenin.
Thank you very much for this result, to all
your soldiers and commanders.
In this part of our meeting, I want to say that
the liberation of Dimitrov and the liberation of Gulyaipole are important
results of your combat efforts.
As for Dimitrov, this is a serious step toward
complete liberation of the Donetsk People’s Republic. Gulyaipole is the second largest
city in the Zaporozhye Region and its liberation opens good prospects for launching
an offensive in the Zaporozhye Region.
I congratulate you all on these results. Thank you
very much.
In conclusion, I would like to say
the following. The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation confidently retain
the initiative and continue to fulfil the objectives of the special military
operation along the entire line of contact. I would like to note the effective
actions of military units and formations of the Centre group of forces during
the elimination of the Ukrainian armed formations encircled in the area of the Krasnoarmeysk-Dimitrov metropolitan area.
As I mentioned earlier, control over
the cities of Krasnoarmeysk and Dimitrov creates favourable conditions for carrying
forward the advance and completely liberating the Donetsk People’s Republic.
The capture of the city of Gulyaipole in the Zaporozhye Region by assault units
of the 5
th
Army was the expected result made possible by the painstaking work of commanders and staffs and the thorough and comprehensive mission training of personnel.
The high pace of the advance by military
units and formations of the East group of forces makes it possible to press
forward, liberating the Zaporozhye Region. Practically speaking, as I understand it, all of this is taking place in close pursuit of the enemy.
I ask the commanders and those
commanders who are on the line with us to convey my words of gratitude to all
personnel of the groups that carried out missions to liberate Dimitrov and Gulyaipole.
The commanders of the groups of forces must continue to carry out their tasks in accordance with the concept of the special military operation.
Here is what I would like to add in the final part of our meeting today in this format. I would like to remind you – although
I have said this more than once, I will say it again – that everything, the confrontation and the hostilities, it all began after the 2014 coup d’etat in Ukraine. Even at that
time, we told the leaders of the Kiev regime that they should give people living in southeastern
Ukraine, who did not recognise the results of that coup, who did not wish to live in a country where a coup is the primary source of power, who did not wish
to live in such a state, the opportunity to exercise their lawful right, to ensure and implement their lawful right to self-determination. This right is
enshrined in the UN Charter. It is called the right of nations to self-determination.
But, unfortunately, neither then, in 2014, nor later, in 2020, no one listened to us. And the Kiev authorities
preferred to unleash large-scale hostilities, a war, to start a war. We are
trying to end it, and from the very beginning, as I said, we stated that it was
necessary to withdraw the troops of the Kiev regime from these territories, and there would be no hostilities. There would have been none had they listened to us back then.
Now we see that in the West, too,
there are sensible people who recommend that the Kiev authorities accept
dignified terms for ending the conflict and offer good basic conditions for ensuring Ukraine’s security over a long historical perspective, for restoring
relations with the Russian Federation, and for rebuilding Ukraine’s economy.
But we see that even today,
unfortunately, the ringleaders of the Kiev regime are in no hurry to resolve
this conflict by peaceful means. I spoke about this a year ago at the Foreign Ministry.
But today, judging by your reports and by the pace of advance we are observing
along the line of contact, our interest in seeing the Ukrainian military
formations withdraw from the territories they currently occupy is effectively
reduced to zero for a variety of reasons.
And if the Kiev authorities are not willing
to bring this matter to a peaceful conclusion, we will accomplish all our objectives
during the special military operation by military means. Let us now discuss
this in detail, specifically, the immediate tasks in relation to the groups of forces whose commanders are present at this meeting.

TITLE: Address on Rescue Worker’s Day • President of Russia

Events
Address on Rescue Worker’s Day
December 27, 2025
00:00
Address on Rescue Worker’s Day.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin:
Comrades,
I extend my congratulations on Rescue Worker’s
Day.
This is a professional holiday for those who are constantly on duty, always
ready to come to the aid of others, acting swiftly, decisively, and effectively
in the most complex and extreme emergency situations.
Of course, today, we also pay special tribute
to the veterans of the Russian Ministry of Emergencies and related services: those
who established the noble traditions of rescuers.
With each passing year, the Ministry’s
technical capabilities and the level of professional training of its personnel
continue to grow. Unique operational experience has been accumulated,
reinforcing the Ministry’s well-deserved reputation as one of the most effective
rescue agencies in the world – and in a number of key areas, unquestionably the best, with no equal.
Over the past years, more than 600
search-and-rescue and humanitarian operations have been conducted outside
Russia.
But obviously, the Ministry’s primary efforts
and all of its resources and capabilities serve to ensure the safety of our
citizens.
Over these 35 years, the number of lives you
have saved without exaggeration amounts to hundreds of thousands. Rescuers are
always the first to arrive where determination, courage, and the highest level
of professional skill are required: the debris of destroyed buildings and at the scenes of major road accidents. You climb mountains, descend into the depths of mines, and land by parachute. You evacuate people from remote areas,
taiga forests, and flood-stricken settlements. Firefighters battle flames to save those in danger.
Today, the Ministry of Emergencies is equipped
with modern technology and advanced equipment. Programmes with elements of artificial intelligence are being introduced.
Increasing attention is being paid to disaster
prevention, including through the use of space-based monitoring systems.
I would like to particularly highlight the work
of the medical professionals and counsellors serving within the Ministry. Their
expertise and dedication are often truly irreplaceable.
I would like to also ask you to convey my sincere gratitude to those employees who are carrying out the most complex and demanding tasks in the conditions of the special military operation, as well as in liberated and border territories. Under fire, you restore critical
infrastructure, deliver humanitarian assistance to civilians, and clear areas
of explosive hazards.
We are proud of your courage and your readiness
to risk your own lives for the sake of others. The people of Russia will never
forget the employees of the Ministry of Emergency Situations – our comrades,
true heroes who gave their lives in the line of duty.
Your examples of professionalism and selfless
service are shaping the next generation of rescuers, who, I am confident, will
prove worthy of this high and honorable calling.
Happy Rescue Worker’s Day to you, dear friends.
And, of course, a Happy New Year. I wish you and your families good health,
strength, and continued success.

Events
Meeting on the main parameters of the State Armament Programme for 2027–2036
Vladimir Putin chaired a meeting to discuss the key
parameters of the draft State Armament Programme for 2027–2036 and the state
programme to develop defence manufacturing.
December 26, 2025
16:15
The Kremlin, Moscow
The preceding meetings on the State
Armament Programme took place on June 11 and 12, 2025.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin
: Colleagues, good afternoon.
Today, we will continue to discuss
two draft documents: the State Armament Programme for 2027–2036 and the state programme
of the defence industry development.
Defence manufacturers have been
steady in their operations and supplying the army with the weapons and hardware
it needs, both units engaged in the special military operation and the Armed
Forces in general.
I would like to thank the staff of the defence sector for their selfless, dedicated and outstanding work.
By working together on our decisions
and offering timely state support, we have been able to achieve a rapid
expansion in terms of the capabilities of defence manufacturers and increase
the production of the weapons we need along the entire supply collaboration chain.
As a result, as I have said many
times, the production of the most needed products for the special military
operation increased several-fold in 2025 compared to 2022.
As a reference point, I can offer
some curious details. The production of armoured vehicles and tanks increased
by a factor of 2.2, with a 3.7-fold increase for light armoured vehicles such
as IFVs and armoured personnel. There was also an increase in aviation hardware
by a factor of 4.6, a 5.7-fold surge in car manufacturing, a 9.6-fold increase
in artillery weapons. The manufacturing of communications and radio electronic
warfare systems increased by a factor of 12.5, with an 18-fold increase in body
armour manufacturing (17.9-fold, in fact), as well as a 22-sold increase in the manufacturing of ordnances and munitions. All this resulted from the efforts by defence manufacturers and the economy in general. Of course, this would have
been impossible without our efforts to promote development and ensure financial
and economic stability in general. This results from our combined efforts.
The very nature, forms and methods
of combat keep evolving in the course of the special military operation with
our troops acquiring invaluable experience. We will make full use of this
know-how for shaping the future of the Armed Forces and the defence industry.
We will continue working on this
agenda as part of the new State Armament Programme. For that, we developed a whole range of measures to steadily expand
high-technology manufacturing capabilities and introduce as much automation as possible for higher labour efficiency while reducing production costs, which is
something I wanted you to focus on. We have a lot of work in this regard, this much
is certain.
We must also continue improving our
testing and training facilities, introduce AI solutions and develop advanced
materials. All this will not only enable us to consolidate and secure the existing advantages of our weapons and hardware, but can also serve as a driver
of innovative development for the entire sector. We have already achieved a great deal along these lines. Of course, there is a lot of work ahead too, as usual.
We have already had detailed
discussions on these matters during the previous meetings. Today, we will
complete the coordination of the main benchmarks of these new state programmes
and their funding parameters.

About Security Council
National security is a very broad term that encompasses the security of the individual, society and the state in the face of both internal and external threats.
National security involves priority areas such as state security, public safety, socioeconomic security and security in the spheres of defense, information, the military and international affairs.
The need for constant analysis and strategic planning regarding all security issues, as well as the drafting of presidential decisions, necessitates the existence of a special constitutional advisory body accountable to the President. This body is the Security Council.
The Security Council drafts policy proposals on defending the vital interests of individuals, society and the state against internal or external threats. The Council also helps determine a uniform state policy on security and helps ensure the President’s ability to carry out his constitutional duties in defending human and civil rights, as well as Russia’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.
The Security Council is formed by the President in accordance with the Constitution and the Federal Law “On Security”. The President chairs the Council and appoints its members. The secretary of the Security Council who answers directly to the President oversees the Council’s work and its Office.
The Security Council was formed in 1992.
The Security Council Office is a separate department of the Presidential Executive Office; its status within the Presidential Executive Office is that of a directorate.
In order to carry out its functions, the Security Council forms inter-agency commissions, which operate as its principal working bodies. Depending on the task, these commissions can be formed on a functional or regional basis, and can be permanent or temporary.
In order to provide scholarly expertise for the Council’s work, there is a Scholarly Council made up of representatives of the Russian Academy of Sciences, specialized academies of science and educational institutions, as well as other academics and experts.
Regular meetings of the Security Council are held according to a schedule set by the Chairman (the President of Russia); if necessary, the Council can hold extraordinary meetings. The Chairman defines the agenda and order of the day based on recommendations by the Secretary of the Security Council. The Chairman presides over meetings, while the Secretary holds working meetings with Council members on a regular basis.
The Security Council draws up crucial documents defining conceptual approaches to national security.

TITLE: Meeting with Deputy Minister of Defence Anna Tsivileva

Meeting with Deputy Minister of Defence Anna Tsivileva
2025-12-30 14:10:00
The Kremlin, Moscow
Vladimir Putin held a working meeting with State Secretary – Deputy Minister of Defence and Chair of the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation to support participants in the special military operation Anna Tsivileva.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ms Tsivileva, today I would like to discuss the aspect of your work that is directly related to the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation.
I know that a great deal is being done, but the most important thing is the personal warmth and dedication you bring to this work. This is absolutely essential in such matters. You must maintain this approach in the future. This is exactly how we should interact with our service personnel who are defending our Motherland.
That said, despite the extensive work being done, as with any such undertaking, there will always be issues that require particular attention. It is possible that some issues or problems arise, which the state previously missed but must resolve now.
Please report on all these areas and, of course, on the results.
Deputy Minister of Defence Anna Tsivileva: Mr President,
Two and a half years ago, the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation was established by your Executive Order. Today, it employs 4,300 social coordinators who carry out their duties not only in all regions of the Russian Federation – our branches are present across the country – but also in municipalities, in small districts, towns, and villages. These are the places where our veterans – participants in the special military operation – return to, and where their families and friends live.
Perhaps the foundation’s main achievement is that we have not simply organised our work in accordance with the Presidential Executive Order and the charter but have created an entire socioeconomic ecosystem. This system deals with rehabilitation and resocialisation, but most importantly, the reintegration of our heroes, as well as their families – particularly the vulnerable category of those who have lost loved ones or whose relatives are missing in action.
Naturally, this work cannot be done dispassionately. Thousands of our social coordinators and employees are themselves participants in the special military operation or their relatives, people who have travelled this path and now have the strength, desire and readiness to help others.
I would like to emphasise that this work has been organised, in large part, thanks to our close and consistent cooperation with other ministries and federal executive bodies. We have established a highly effective interdepartmental cooperation framework. We actively participate in the work of the Government, as well as the legislative bodies: the State Duma and the Federation Council. We maintain ongoing cooperation with all ministries and relevant federal executive authorities whose decisions directly affect the integration of our veterans into civilian life and the provision of assistance to them.
We also work in close coordination with the security agencies: first and foremost with the Ministry of Defence, the Prosecutor’s Office, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Guard Service, the National Guard, and Rosfinmonitoring. In other words, with all agencies that support our efforts and help address a wide range of issues that arise. You are absolutely right in saying that we often face complex, non-standard, and extraordinary challenges. The format you created – a state foundation with a flexible rather than a rigid bureaucratic structure that works directly with individual requests – has proven its effectiveness. This structure makes it possible to act quickly and make decisions promptly, even in situations that are new not only for us, but also for the state. Thanks to this coordinated approach, decisions on assistance are made swiftly and reach our veterans in the shortest possible time.
Feedback is an essential task for us. Each veteran is supported by a dedicated social coordinator who works directly with the individual and their family, fully understanding their specific circumstances and needs. Our objective is not merely to resolve an issue or respond to an inquiry, but to accompany the veteran through every stage until the matter is fully resolved. It is essential that a veteran knows that a social coordinator is always there: a constant point of support and guidance throughout their lives.
Over the two and a half years of our operation, we have received approximately 2.3 million requests and appeals for various forms of assistance. Of these, 96 percent have been resolved positively. In addition, the Federal Guard Service conducted a sociological survey to assess the level of trust our core audience places in the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation. The results show a 90 percent approval rate, which is a strong indicator of confidence and trust on the part of our beneficiaries.
What are our areas of focus and our responsibilities? They mainly cover essential support services: obtaining necessary documents, payments, ensuring access to state social security benefits, offering free legal assistance, and arranging medical care, including health resort treatment when needed. Special care is provided for those who are injured, severely wounded, or disabled. They receive modern prosthetics – including devices not listed on the federal programme – or, if necessary, we pay an additional fee to the Social Fund to secure a certificate, allowing the individual to obtain prosthetics that restore as much functionality as possible.
This marks a major advancement in the prosthetic field, which has evolved considerably over the past year and a half as we established a standard for prosthetic care. We are now funding not just the prosthesis itself, but a full spectrum of services, including rehabilitation, pre-fitting preparation, fitting, and training in prosthetic use. Thanks to this comprehensive approach, our heroes can now genuinely lead fully active lives.
During the prosthetic industry exhibition at the Federation Council, Valentina Matviyenko and I were touring the displays when we met some of our service members who, despite serious injuries, had chosen to continue serving in the Ministry of Defence. They shared how they had run a half marathon – nearly 22 kilometres – and were training for a full marathon. Ms Matviyenko rightly remarked, “What kind of disabled persons are they? Few of those here could perform the work these guys do.” And she was absolutely right. Therefore, reviewing regulations, including legislative ones, has now become a routine part of our work because…
Vladimir Putin: Any revisions must not, under any circumstances, infringe the rights of our guys.
Anna Tsivileva: Of course.
Vladimir Putin: These changes should serve only to improve and stabilise their situation, never to make it worse.
Anna Tsivileva: Exactly. Our initiatives are driven entirely by the veterans’ own requests; they do not infringe their rights but instead provide them with additional opportunities. We often receive inquiries on key issues such as acquiring new skills, retraining, and further education. This also extends to employment and resocialisation, aiming for the full integration of individuals into society, regardless of their disabilities.
In other words, we have fundamentally reshaped society’s perception of people with disabilities. They are no longer seen merely as individuals in need of help, but as people with the opportunity to lead active lives, benefit the state, and fully pursue their goals and aspirations. This represents an entirely new mindset, one inspired by the veterans themselves through their proactive approach to life and their determination to continue serving the state, even in civilian roles.
This [presentation] briefly covers our spheres of activity in figures. One of them is medical assistance. We consider it important to conduct a medical examination of those who return [from the special military operation] because medical support they will receive from healthcare facilities depends on the state of their health. Based on the results of medical examination of 65,000 such people, we have identified health issues in 55,000 cases and new medical conditions in 12,000 cases. Checking up on your health is really very important, especially since our heroes do not pay much attention to their health. Like other people, they sometimes have latent health issues. If left unattended, they can eventually reactivate, whereas comprehensive health screening helps young people take care of their health, improving their health or dealing with medical problems that got worse during the hostilities.
The family factor is extremely important. According to statistics, rehabilitation is much more effective when you have a close relative by your side. We encourage families to accompany our heroes during rehabilitation programmes and even cover the cost of these trips.
Other issues have to do with providing technical means of rehabilitation. It is also important that we help improve living conditions in houses and flats where people with disabilities live. This is very important; it makes everyday life more comfortable for them and their families. This includes specialised kitchens, bathrooms, special openings, and smart home equipment. If they decide to work from home, which some of them do, especially those who are wheelchair-bound or have lost their eyesight, we provide the necessary equipment so that they can work from home and also receive new competencies, for example, online.
We have a wonderful programme used at School 21, Sberbank’s school of digital technology, where IT professionals, including those who were seriously wounded or have lost their eyesight, are trained remotely.
Speaking about prosthetic devices, our men are good athletes seriously engaged in sports.
As for retraining and employment, it is an extremely important sphere, as I have pointed out. Moreover, it is very important for us to help our veterans expand their horizons. In this photo you can see our veteran, a long-haul driver. We travelled with him in his KAMAZ truck. The KAMAZ manufacturer has started making hand-controlled trucks and buses, including public transport, which we have seen at the Abilympics competition in Kazan, so that our veterans can use prosthetic legs and arms to resume their profession.
Of course, there is great demand for our programme of providing vehicles to double amputees. Our men not only gladly use them to work and spend time with their families but also willingly take part in rallies and even take extreme driving courses.
Certainly, we engage our veterans in sporting and cultural events. Sports play a vital role for them. We have individuals with prosthetics who go mountaineering. There was an instance this year of them climbing Mount Elbrus. We have a team that plays rugby and goes skiing, having mastered these sports while using prosthetics. They also take part in snowboarding. Indeed, the demand for active sports is very high
This serves not only as a means of improving health, but also as a tool for resocialisation, as it transforms a combat brotherhood into a sporting one. They come together, share experience, support each other, feel much more at ease and confident, and, of course, challenge one another to competitions and various contests. They meet and communicate very actively.
Regional governors also provide active support, and we regularly hold Defenders of the Fatherland Cup competitions.
A particularly important area is our veterans’ participation in the patriotic education of young people and in preserving the memory of our heroes, their comrades-in-arms. Memorial plaques are being established, and various projects are being developed that truthfully convey the story of a comrade’s feat. We have already published an entire trilogy – three books written by veterans themselves, our heroes who are participants in the special military operation.
Vladimir Putin: Are they the authors?
Anna Tsivileva: Yes, they are the authors.
These books have now been eagerly taken up by our film directors and producers, with plays being staged in the regions based precisely on these real-life stories and accounts written by our heroes.
I would also like to note that we have actively implemented the instructions on which you gave us your support, and they have proven to be very necessary and in demand. As I mentioned earlier, this includes the distribution of vehicles. But we also had another project – the design, production, and distribution of adaptive clothing for our veterans, taking into account their specific conditions and injuries.
This is particularly important work, and it originated from seeing, during meetings with veterans, how they would adapt regular clothing for themselves, cutting and sewing it themselves. This is, of course, unsatisfactory. We now have a project we named On Wings, which brought together our designers and clothing manufacturers to begin producing stylish, fashionable clothing for various purposes. This includes business suits, sportswear, casual wear, and even evening attire for formal events, all tailored to the specific needs of individuals with disabilities.
Through the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation, we distribute such sets – comprising winter, summer, and demi-season outfits as complete collections. The greatest number of requests is precisely for this clothing. It allows our veterans, these young men, to feel fashionable and stylish, which is their wish. One of their key desires is for this clothing not to highlight their disability but to be like everyone else’s. That is our objective here.
Furthermore, for those who continue to serve within the structures of the Ministry of Defence and security agencies, clothing and military uniforms are now being developed with account for disabilities, prosthetics, and even specialised footwear. This is very important.
Another project we have implemented with you is the effort to expand the scope of the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation’s work to include the families of those missing in action. This initiative now allows us to provide these families with crucial support, including psychological support. Their members often become psychologists themselves and it gives them a chance to process their own grief, fosters a powerful sense of community and shared purpose; this peer support model helps them find respite from their grief.
Many of the women who have themselves lost loved ones have become trained psychologists and our foundation staff. Furthermore, we offer this category of beneficiaries comprehensive assistance in securing due payments and legal support.
A particularly sensitive issue has also been successfully resolved. Combat veteran status has now been granted to individuals from special military units who contracted with the Ministry of Defence directly from penal institutions. The core concern was one of perceived inequity, as these individuals had demonstrably atoned for past offences through their service. Their persistent request for formal veteran recognition and the full spectrum of social benefits that accompany it has now been fulfilled thanks to your support. This matter is now resolved.
Pursuant to the Minister’s instruction, we are actively digitalising the Defence Ministry’s operations, specifically social support mechanisms. A key example is the certificate of participation in the special military operation. Previously, obtaining this document involved months of bureaucratic procedures. Now, it is accessible almost instantly with a single click through the government services portal. This certificate is directly linked to approximately 70 percent of state-provided social support measures.
Furthermore, we are developing a unified data platform, or “data mart.” This system will integrate all support measures available to a veteran based on their region of residence. All regions will be connected to this platform by the end of the current year. Its primary benefit is proactive, simplified access: veterans will be able to obtain information via the government services portal about support measures for which they are eligible.
Therefore, digital transformation is a critical priority for us – given the scale of our mission, the requirements we must meet, and, most importantly, our own internal drive to deliver these improvements as quickly as possible.
We would also like to make a proposal. First of all, we would like to thank you for the extensive support you have provided and for helping us implement a large number of important initiatives. However, there are several issues I would like to raise.
The first concerns active-duty military personnel who currently fall outside the scope of the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation, as our mandate formally applies only to those who have been discharged from the security services.
Vladimir Putin: There are those who choose to remain in service.
Anna Tsivileva: Exactly. Among them are soldiers who, despite having sustained severe injuries or disabilities, continue their service. They undoubtedly deserve the same level of care and support. This includes access to prosthetics, technical rehabilitation equipment, the adaptation of their living conditions, as I mentioned earlier, and the opportunity to participate in sporting events, including covering travel expenses for competitions such as the Defenders of the Fatherland Cup. This category of soldiers regularly turns to us for assistance.
At present, we are addressing these needs through extra-budgetary resources and sponsors. However, we believe this assistance should be provided on a systemic basis. Young men who became disabled as a result of combat-related injuries should also fall within our scope of care in terms of support in these areas.
The second category includes those who participated in counter-terrorism operations in our border regions. We propose extending our coverage to include them as well.
These are the issues and requests we have. The Supervisory Board has approved this proposal, and we respectfully ask for your support in amending the relevant Executive Order.
Vladimir Putin: Let us do this. What difference does it make whether combat operations took place in a border area or in the special military operation zone? Formally, there is no difference. These individuals were defending the Fatherland under life-threatening conditions, and they sustained serious injuries. For the state, and for society, this distinction should not exist. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to extend this support to both categories.
As for the first group, this is equally self-evident. Perhaps this situation was not fully considered previously: if a person remains in service within the Armed Forces, it may appear that they remain under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defence. But that should not concern us. It should not matter. A person took part in hostilities and was seriously wounded; of course, the state has an obligation to ensure they can feel fully in-demand, not only within their service in the Ministry of Defence, but also beyond it. As you rightly noted, they should have full access to sports and to housing adapted to their post-injury needs. This must, without question, be done.
I would like to thank you and everyone working at the foundation, not only for the results you have achieved, but also for the sincere and caring attitude toward your work and toward people. This is the most important thing. I see that our men recognise this, feel it, understand it, and support your efforts. For my part, I will do everything possible to ensure that this work continues to be carried out as effectively as possible.
Thank you, Ms Tsivileva.

Telephone conversation with President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko
2025-12-31 19:30:00
Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
During the conversation, President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko vehemently condemned the reckless Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian President's residence in the Novgorod Region.
It was emphasised that this cynical provocation occurred against the backdrop of ongoing Russian-American engagements aimed at finding a peaceful resolution to the Ukraine crisis.
After discussing the incident, the leaders exchanged cordial New Year's greetings and expressed their best wishes to the fraternal peoples of both countries.

Telephone conversation with President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon
2025-12-31 11:45:00
Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with President of the Republic of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon.
Emomali Rahmon strongly condemned the unprecedented Ukrainian drone attack targeting the Russian President's official residence in the Novgorod Region overnight into December 29. It was noted that this flagrant provocation occurred in the middle of robust engagements between Russia and the United States aiming to find a peaceful solution for the Ukraine crisis.
After sharing opinions on this reckless act by the Kiev regime, the leaders exchanged cordial New Year's greetings.
They also discussed regional issues in light of the recent developments in Afghanistan.
The leaders confirmed their mutual commitment to further strengthening the strategic partnership and allied relationship between Russia and Tajikistan.

UGANDA SIGNALS READINESS TO MOVE TOWARD RATIFICATION AS REGIONAL BODIES CONSULT ON NIAMEY CONVENTION IN KAMPALA
International
December 03, 2025
A consultative meeting on the ratification of the Niamey Convention has taken place at Fairway Hotel, Kampala, from 2-3 December 2025, bringing together key stakeholders from government ministries, regional bodies, and development partners to advance Uganda’s commitment to improved border governance and cross-border cooperation.
Adopted in 2014, the Niamey Convention aims to transform African borders from historical barriers into avenues of cooperation and development. It provides a legal framework for African Union Member States to resolve border issues peacefully, promote socio-economic growth, and strengthen cross-border collaboration. Its core objectives include promoting cross-border cooperation, transforming border areas, facilitating delimitation and demarcation, enabling peaceful dispute resolution, improving border governance, and advancing peace and stability across the continent.
The Convention prioritizes several key areas: socio-economic development, security, border management, institutional strengthening, and cultural and sports cooperation. Delivering his opening remarks , Mr. Abraham Pekelye, the GIZ representative to the African Union Border Programme (AUBP) on behalf of the programme’s Regional
Coordinator, reflected on GIZ’s long-standing support to border governance initiatives. “Since 2008, GIZ support to the African Union Border Programme has focused on working closely with the African Union, the Regional Economic Communities, and Member States to enhance border governance across the continent,” he said.
Mr. Pekelye further highlighted that the sensitization and consultation workshops on the African Union Border Governance Strategy held in October 2023 for EAC Member States and in May 2024 for IGAD Member States, both in Uganda, demonstrated strong regional commitment to integration and frameworks that nurture cooperation. He shared that GIZ remains fully committed to supporting the African Union and its Member States in realizing the objectives of the AUBP.
Representing the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs(MoFA), Ambassador John Leonard Mugerwa delivered remarks emphasizing the importance of cross-border cooperation and Uganda’s readiness to move toward ratification and alignment with continental border governance frameworks. Hepresented aspects of the constitutional framework, legal procedures, and practical steps involved in transforming international instruments into domestic law within Uganda’s legal system. He further highlighted Uganda’s treaty-making framework and how it underscores the
need for transparency and clear institutional responsibility, a principle reflected in the conclusion that all treaties ratified by the cabinet must be promptly presented to parliament, with the Minister of Foreign Affairs responsible for signing, sealing, depositing, and serving as the official depository for all treaties.
In her presentation, Dr. Edith Nsubuga, acting head of regional peace and security department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, explained in depth, Uganda’s border evolution, border dynamics, and the potential of borders as bridges for cooperation and development. She highlighted the linkage between the Niamey Convention, the AU’s Agenda 2063 (The Africa We Want), and Uganda’s National Development Plan IV (NDP IV). She also emphasized the Convention’s alignment with Uganda’s foreign policy and its contribution to regional peace and security. “Its importance lies in two main dimensions. First is the legal mandate, which shifts the focus from simply demarcating borders to jointly managing them. Secondly, it aligns with Agenda 2063, which envisions a peaceful and integrated Africa with seamless borders,” stated Namutebi.
Day two of the meeting featured an in-depth presentation by Ms. Allen Bucyana, a representative from the Ministry of Justice, on the steps for cabinet approval of the ratification of the convention and constitutional alignment, as well as how to align legal frameworks with these developments. Notably, a representative from Kenya’s Office of the Attorney General, Ms. Nelly Lodian, shared reflections on the experiences of the Kenyan ratification process, providing the audience with valuable insights.
The consultative process demonstrates that strong government cooperation, particularly among MDAs, regional bodies, and partners, is crucial for effective border governance. Notably, these discussions emphasized that treaty ratification must follow transparent legal processes, and borders should not be viewed as barriers but as opportunities for
development, peace, and collaboration. The meeting also emphasized the importance of aligning national policies with continental frameworks, such as Agenda 2063, learning from regional frameworks, and demonstrating strong political will to advance integration and stability.

UGANDA ELECTED TO UNIDO INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BOARD (IDB) 2025- 2027
International
December 01, 2025
Uganda has been elected to the Industrial Development Board (IDB) of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) for the period 2025- 2027 at elections conducted during the 21st UNIDO General Conference held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from 23rd to 27th November 2025.
The Industrial Development Board is composed of 53 Members and is responsible for reviewing implementation of UNIDO’s work programme, the regular and operational budgets, and makes recommendations to the General Conference on policy matters, including the appointment of the Director-General. Uganda's Delegation to the General Conference was led by H.E. Isaac Sebulime, Ambassador of the Republic of Uganda to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and comprised of officials from the Uganda Permanent Mission in Vienna and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives.
In his address to the General Conference, Amb. Sebulime commended UNIDO for promoting inclusive and sustainable industrial development worldwide. He noted that Uganda is particularly interested in accelerating the country’s national development agenda by using UNIDO’s expertise in transformative partnerships, knowledge transfer, and agro-industrialization. ‘Uganda’s focus on promoting innovation, improving productivity, and increasing the level of value addition from primary processing of raw materials to secondary and tertiary manufacturing of medium to high technology products for exports, aligns closely with UNIDO’s mission’, he added.
According to UNIDO, 125 million people worldwide depend on coffee for their livelihoods. Uganda is currently one of five countries (Uganda, Kenya, Malawi, Ethiopia, Tanzania) earmarked to receive assistance in the coffee value chain development through the UNIDO-Italy programme for Advancing Climate-Resilience and Transformation in African Coffee (ACT). The programme worth €15 million is aimed at improving the lives of the people at the beginning of the coffee supply chain by providing better jobs and better incomes for families and communities.  The General Conference was held as the Global Industry Summit under 3 key thematic areas, namely: Investment and Partnership; Women and Empowerment; and Generation Future. The Session on Women Empowerment focused on the essential
role women play in the economy and industry, and the importance of equal rights, equal access to education, training and finance, and equal opportunities in the workplace and in professional life.
Delivering the Key note address, Her Highness Princess Mashael Saud Al-Shalaan, founder of AEON Collective, highlighted the fast progress that has been made in Saudi Arabia's development and the significant progress made in providing equal opportunities for women - from equal pay to more female participation in STEM education. She emphasized that both equality and gender equity should be at the heart of industrial policy and called upon governments to truly listen to women’s voices, ‘to understand their needs, recognize the barriers they confront, and support them in rewriting those stories - keeping what empowers them and changing what holds them back’.
During the General Conference, Nature Bio Foods, an Indian Company with operations in Uganda was announced winner of the UNIDO One World Sustainability Awards under the Category of Sustainable Supply Chains. The Award was received by Mr. Amit Singh, Sustainability Lead, who noted that one cannot talk about sustainability without talking
about agriculture. Therefore, sustainability is about ‘how to increase the income of the farmers, how to reduce the cost of cultivation, and how take the farmers to the stage where they can grow and prosper.’
Nature Bio Foods is a Subsidiary of LT Foods, which is headquartered in India. The company opened a processing plant in Uganda in 2023 and is currently working with 16000 farmers involved in the production of soyabean, sorghum, chia seeds and sesame seeds for export. END

UGANDA DEEPENS REGIONAL CREATIVE COOPERATION AT THE 11th MASHARIKI AFRICAN FILM FESTIVAL IN KIGALI, RWANDA
International
December 01, 2025
Ugandan Documentary Memories of Love Returned by celebrated Ugandan-American actor and filmmaker Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine, won the award for Best Documentary at the 11 th Mashariki African Film Festival, held from 22–29 November 2025 in Kigali, Rwanda. The win marks a significant milestone for Uganda’s growing film industry and
reinforcing the country’s expanding creative footprint on the continental stage. Mashariki African Film Festival continues to be one of the region’s leading platforms for creative exchange. The Uganda High Commission in Kigali was a sponsor of the Uganda pavilion and participated in the festival which was founded to celebrate and elevate African cinema.
The Uganda High Commission in Kigali coordinated Uganda’s engagement to ensure that cultural cooperation contributes to broader diplomatic objectives. Cultural diplomacy remains central to Uganda’s foreign policy, and shared initiatives with Rwanda continuing to advance film production, talent mobility, cultural tourism, and investment.
“The Mission’s involvement reflects the Uganda Government’s commitment to strengthening bilateral ties with Rwanda while advancing cultural diplomacy and regional cooperation in the creative industries,” said Michael Bulwaka, Counsellor at the Mission. “Ugandan filmmakers’ and creatives’ participation in this festival aligns with Uganda’s national priorities to grow the film, music, and digital content sectors, particularly through youth empowerment, skills development, and the expansion of cultural exports,” he added.
Running alongside the festival was the Kigali International Content Market, a major convening hub for filmmakers, broadcasters, distributors, and cultural institutions from across Africa and beyond. Uganda’s participation enabled filmmakers and creative entrepreneurs to build networks, pursue partnerships, and access new markets. “The Kigali International Content Market offers Ugandan creatives an opportunity to strengthen collaboration with Rwandan industry partners and deepen cross-border creative ties. We thank the Uganda High Commission for facilitating this,” said CEO of the Uganda Film and Culture Market Godfrey Musinguzi who led the Ugandan Filmmakers.
During the opening ceremony at Serena Hotel on 22 November, festival founder Mr. Tressoh Senghor welcomed delegates from across the continent, highlighting the region’s growth in creative development, including the unprecedented decision to award the Best Actor and Actress—an indication of the sector’s rising ambition and competitiveness.
A keynote address was delivered by Professor Martin Mhando Research Fellow in the School of Media, Communication and Culture at Murdoch University in Western Australia. Mhando underscored the socio-economic value of cultural festivals, noting their role in shaping national narratives, fostering regional identity, and creating
sustainable economic opportunities. He emphasized mentorship, youth-focused skills development, and culturally grounded innovation as essential to Africa’s creative future. As the East African Community deepens integration, Uganda reaffirms the centrality of the creative economy as a key driver of regional unity and global visibility. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue facilitating dialogue, partnerships, and institutional linkages to strengthen Uganda’s creative sector and enhance its contribution to regional innovation and cultural growth.

UGANDA–QATAR EMBASSY HOSTS SUCCESSFUL 2025 UGANDA DIASPORA CONVENTION IN DOHA
International
December 01, 2025
The Embassy of the Republic of Uganda in Doha successfully hosted the 2025 Uganda–Qatar Diaspora Convention, bringing together hundreds of Ugandan migrant workers, diaspora leaders, government officials, and private-sector partners for a full day of engagement, empowerment, and service delivery.
The Convention followed a three-day capacity-building programme for Embassy staff and Diaspora Community leaders, aimed at strengthening approaches to diaspora management. As part of this programme, Embassy officials conducted outreach visits to Ugandans in various accommodation facilities, listening to their concerns and assessing
welfare needs. The Mowasalat (Karwa) meeting, attended by over 110 Ugandans, formed part of this broader engagement and informed several of the issues addressed during the Convention.
The Convention was led by Mr. Bagonza Muhammad, Senior Presidential Advisor on Diaspora Affairs and Head of the Diaspora Unit in State House, accompanied by Mrs. Desree Barlow, Presidential Assistant and Head of the Research Desk in the Office of the President. Mr. Bagonza delivered key national updates, noting that Uganda’s global
diaspora remittances now exceed UGX 6.5 trillion annually and that Ugandans in Gulf countries contribute approximately 38–40% of this total. These insights were reinforced by Mr. Patrick Batenze of Liberation Community Finance, who addressed the Convention on safe investment opportunities back home.
Mr. Bagonza further briefed the community on progress toward a new Diaspora Law, the Diaspora App, and plans for a Government Call Centre, as well as preparations for deploying a mobile biometric kit and, eventually, a passport machine in Qatar. He assured participants that the Government is committed to addressing concerns about Interpol fees, communication charges, money-transfer costs, and driving-permit alignment.
Amb. Dr. Mohammed Baswari Kezaala, Deputy Head of Mission, commended Ugandans in Qatar for their discipline, unity, and patriotism. Reaffirming the Embassy’s commitment to safeguarding the welfare and rights of all Ugandans in Qatar, Amb. Kezaala said “Ugandans enjoy a positive reputation among Qatari employers, the continued growth of the Mission’s cultural expo, and the importance of responsible financial behavior, skills development, and respectful conduct in the host country”. He acknowledged the strengthening of bilateral relations following the opening of Qatar’s Embassy in Kampala, describing it as a milestone made possible through the goodwill of His Highness the Emir of Qatar. Drawing from his official address, he also recognized the strong support Ugandans showed for the Uganda FIFA U-17 football team, which demonstrated exceptional national pride.
During the Convention, the Chairman of the Uganda Community in Qatar (UGACOQ), Mr. Aliguma Saul Rayan, also addressed participants, encouraging them to remain united, register with community structures, and work collaboratively with the Embassy for the welfare and progress of all Ugandans living in Qatar. Concerns raised by the
community included mobile-money fraud, recruitment-agency overcharging, financial-literacy gaps, high Interpol fees, driving-permit challenges, high telecom charges, diaspora voting clarity, and the need for stronger banking linkages between Uganda and Qatar.
Government officials assured the community that diaspora voting is already provided for under Ugandan law and will be implemented. The programme included a dedicated cancer-awareness engagement for the diaspora community, overseen by Mr. Benson Akampumuza, Chairman of Peninsula, who coordinated the wellness activities held at Wings Sports Club in Lusail City. The event featured a performance by the Twegatte Cultural Troupe, adding a vibrant cultural
element that underscored the strength and diversity of the Ugandan community.
The 2025 Uganda–Qatar Diaspora Convention has been widely praised for its organization, relevance, and strong alignment with the needs of Ugandans living and working in Qatar. The Embassy expressed its appreciation to all government officials, community leaders, and volunteers who contributed to the success of the event, reaffirming its commitment to sustained engagement, improved service delivery, and strengthened support systems for the Ugandan community.

Both delegations noted that the session follows recent bilateral directives issued by H.E. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of the Republic of Uganda, and H.E. William Samoei Ruto, President of the Republic of Kenya, during their meeting of 30 July 2025. The directives emphasized strengthening border operations, improving infrastructure, enhancing people-to-people exchanges, and promoting trade and joint development initiatives.
Delegates acknowledged the need to address ongoing challenges affecting border efficiency, including delays in clearance processes, harmonization of standards, and coordination among relevant agencies, from which the JBC sessions will review progress since the last meeting in 2019 to identify gaps and agree on actionable measures to improve border governance.
Both countries reaffirmed their commitment to cooperative border management, regional integration, and the enhancement of security, trade, and community development along the shared boundary.

ТӨРИЙН ТЭРГҮҮНИЙ НАМТАР
МӨРИЙН ХӨТӨЛБӨР
Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч бол төрийн тэргүүн,
Монголын ард түмний эв нэгдлийг илэрхийлэгч мөн
Ерөнхийлөгчөөр тавин нас хүрсэн, сүүлийн таваас доошгүй жил эх орондоо байнга оршин суусан, Монгол Улсын уугуул иргэнийг зургаан жилийн хугацаагаар зөвхөн нэг удаа сонгоно.
Монгол Улсын Yндсэн Хуулийн Гучдугаар Зvйлээс
Ерөнхийлөгчийн бvрэн эрх тангараг өргөснөөр эхэлж, шинэ сонгогдсон Ерөнхийлөгч тангараг өргөснөөр дуусгавар болно.
Монгол Улсын Yндсэн Хуулийн Гучин Хоёрдугаар зvйлийн 1 дэх хэсгээс
Ерөнхийлөгч дараахь vндсэн бvрэн эрхийг хэрэгжvvлнэ:
Улсын Их Хурлын баталсан хууль, бусад шийдвэрт бvхэлд нь буюу зарим хэсэгт нь хориг тавих. Ерөнхийлөгчийн тавьсан хоригийг Улсын Их Хурлаар хэлэлцэж, чуулганд оролцсон нийт гишvvний гуравны хоёр нь хvлээж аваагvй бол уг хууль, шийдвэр хvчин төгөлдөр хэвээр vлдэнэ;
Улсын Их Хуралд олонхи суудал авсан нам, эвслээс нэр дэвшvvлсэн хvнийг; аль ч нам, эвсэл олонхийн суудал аваагvй бол хамгийн олон суудал авсан нам, эвсэл бусад нам, эвсэлтэй зөвшилцөн нэр дэвшvvлсэн хvнийг; хэрэв хамгийн олон суудал авсан нам, эвсэл бусад нам, эвсэлтэй зөвшилцөж Ерөнхий сайдад нэр дэвшvvлж чадаагvй бол Улсын Их Хуралд суудал авсан нам, эвсэл зөвшилцөн олонхиороо нэр дэвшvvлсэн хvнийг Ерөнхий сайд – аар томилох саналыг тав хоногийн дотор Улсын Их Хуралд оруулах; (Энэ заалтыг 1999 оны 12 дугаар сарын 24-ний өдөр батлагдсан Монгол Улсын үндсэн хуульд оруулсан нэмэлт, өөрчлөлтөөр өөрчлөн найруулсан бөгөөд үндсэн Хуулийн Цэцийн 2000 оны 02 дугаар тогтоолоор хvчингvй болсон. Мөн 2000 оны 12 дугаар сарын 14-ний өдөр батлагдсан Монгол Улсын үндсэн хуульд оруулсан нэмэлт, өөрчлөлтөөр өөрчлөн найруулсан)
Өөрийн бvрэн эрхэд хамаарах асуудлаар Засгийн газарт чиглэл өгөх. Энэ талаар Ерөнхийлөгч зарлиг гаргавал тvvнд Ерөнхий сайд гарын vсэг зурснаар хvчин төгөлдөр болно;
Гадаад харилцаанд улсаа бvрэн эрхтэй төлөөлж, Улсын Их Хуралтай зөвшилцөн Монгол Улсын нэрийн өмнөөс олон улсын гэрээ байгуулах;
Монгол Улсаас гадаад улсад суух бvрэн эрхт төлөөлөгчийн газрын тэргvvнийг Улсын Их Хуралтай зөвшилцөн томилох буюу эгvvлэн татах;
Монгол Улсад суух гадаад улсын бvрэн эрхт төлөөлөгчийн газрын тэргvvний итгэмжлэх, эгvvлэн татах жуух бичгийг хvлээн авах;
Улсын цол, цэргийн дээд цол хvртээх, одон, медалиар шагнах;
Уучлал vзvvлэх;
Монгол Улсын харьяат болох, харьяатаас гарах, тус улсад орогнох эрх олгох асуудлыг шийдвэрлэх;
Монгол Улсын vндэсний аюулгvй байдлын зөвлөлийг тэргvvлэх;
Бvх нийтийн буюу хэсэгчилсэн цэргийн дайчилгаа зарлах;
Үндсэн хуулийн хорин тавдугаар зvйлийн 2, З дахь хэсэгт заасан онцгой нөхцөл бий болбол Улсын Их Хурлын чуулганы чөлөө цагт, хойшлуулшгvй тохиолдолд улсын нийт нутаг дэвсгэрт буюу зарим хэсэгт нь онц болон дайны байдал зарлах, тvvнчлэн цэрэг хөдөлгөх захирамж өгөх. Онц байдал, дайны байдал зарласан Ерөнхийлөгчийн зарлигийг Улсын Их Хурал уул зарлиг гарснаас хойш долоо хоногийн дотор хэлэлцэж батлах буюу хvчингvй болгоно. Хэрэв Улсын Их Хурал шийдвэр гаргаагvй бол уул зарлиг хvчингvй болно.
Монгол Улсын Yндсэн Хуулийн 33 дугаар зvйлийн 1 дэх хэсэг
Ерөнхийлөгч Монгол Улсын зэвсэгт хvчний ерөнхий командлагч байна.

Монгол Улсын Yндсэн Хуулийн 33 дугаар зvйлийн 3 дэх хэсэг
Ерөнхийлөгчид тодорхой бvрэн эрхийг зөвхөн хуулиар олгож болно.
Монгол Улсын Yндсэн Хуулийн 33 дугаар зvйлийн 4 дэх хэсэг
Ерөнхийлөгч бvрэн эрхийнхээ хvрээнд хуульд нийцvvлэн зарлиг гаргана.
Монгол Улсын Yндсэн Хуулийн 34 дугаар зvйлийн 1 дэх хэсэг
Ерө
нхийлөгчийн зарлиг хуульд нийцээгvй бол Ерөнхийлөгч өөрөө буюу Улсын Их Хурал хvчингvй болгоно.
Монгол Улсын Yндсэн Хуулийн 34 дугаар зvйлийн 2 дэх хэсэг
Ерөнхийлөгчийн бие, өргөө, унаа халдашгvй дархан байна.
Монгол Улсын Yндсэн Хуулийн 36 дугаар зvйлийн 1 дэх хэсэг
Ерөнхийлөгчийн нэр төр, халдашгvй байдлыг хуулиар хамгаална.

Монгол, Орос, Хятадын Төрийн тэргүүн нар уулзав
Шанхайн хамтын ажиллагааны байгууллагын гишүүн орнуудын Төрийн тэргүүн нарын зөвлөлийн өргөтгөсөн хуралдааны хүрээнд Монгол, Орос, Хятадын Төрийн тэргүүн нарын ээлжит зургаадугаар уулзалт Бүгд Найрамдах Узбекистан Улсын Самарканд хотноо 09 дүгээр сарын 15-ны өдөр болов.
Талууд Монгол, Орос, Хятадын Эдийн засгийн коридорын хэрэгжилтийг эрчимжүүлэх, гурван талын хамтын ажиллагааны тодорхой чиглэлд ахиц гаргах талаар хэлэлцлээ.
Тухайлбал, “Монгол, Орос, Хятадын Эдийн засгийн коридор байгуулах хөтөлбөр”-т тусгасан гурван улсыг холбосон төмөр замын төв коридорыг шинэчлэн хөгжүүлэх, техник, эдийн засгийн үндэслэлийн ажлыг эхлүүлэхээр тохиролцов.
Түүнчлэн төмөр замын зүүн, баруун коридорыг байгуулах, хил, гаалийн чиглэлд хамтын ажиллагааг гүнзгийрүүлэхийн чухлыг харилцан онцоллоо. Гурван улсын хооронд авто тээврийг хөгжүүлэн, Азийн авто замын сүлжээгээр гурван улсын хооронд тээврийг нэмэгдүүлэх талаар ярилцав.
Монгол Улсын нутаг дэвсгэрээр дамжуулан ОХУ-аас БНХАУ руу байгалийн хий дамжуулах хоолой барих төсөл нь гурван улсын хамтын ажиллагаанд онцгой ач холбогдолтой болохыг талууд онцоллоо.
Төслийн хэрэгжилтийг эрчимжүүлэх чиглэлд хамтран ажиллаж, төслийг хариуцсан холбогдох аж ахуйн нэгжүүдийн уялдаа холбоог хангах нь чухал гэдэгт талууд санал нэгдэв.
Иргэд хоорондын харилцаа, хил дамнасан аялал, жуулчлалыг хөгжүүлэх нь гурван улсын харилцаанд чухал ач холбогдолтой гэдэгт Төрийн тэргүүн нар санал нэгдлээ.
“Монгол, Орос, Хятадын Эдийн засгийн коридор байгуулах хөтөлбөр”-ийн хугацааг таван жилээр сунгасныг Төрийн тэргүүн нар уулзалтын үеэр тэмдэглэлээ.
Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч Ухнаагийн Хүрэлсүх уулзалтын үеэр хэлсэн үгэндээ Монгол Улсын газарзүйн байршлын онцлогт тулгуурлан олон улсын транзит тээврийг хөгжүүлэх, энэ хүрээнд гурван улсын эдийн засгийн коридорын хөтөлбөрт тусгасан төслүүдийн хэрэгжилтийг эрчимжүүлэх нь чухал байгааг онцлов.
Түүнчлэн дэлхийн цаг уурын өөрчлөлтийн эсрэг гурван улсын хүчин чармайлтыг нэгтгэж, байгаль орчны чиглэлээр авч хэрэгжүүлж байгаа бодлого, үйл ажиллагааг уялдуулан, Монгол Улсад хэрэгжиж буй “Тэрбум мод” үндэсний хөдөлгөөний хүрээнд тодорхой төсөл, хөтөлбөрүүдийг хамтран хэрэгжүүлэх саналыг дэвшүүлэв.
Дэлхийн уур амьсгалын өөрчлөлттэй тэмцэх, хүлэмжийн хийг бууруулж, тогтвортой хөгжлийг дэмжихийн тулд эдийн засгийн үр өгөөж өндөртэй, сэргээгдэх эрчим хүчний эх үүсвэрийг нэмэгдүүлэх нь Монгол Улсад чухал буйг онцлон тэмдэглэлээ.
Энэ хүрээнд “Эрдэнэбүрэнгийн усан цахилгаан станц”, “Эгийн голын усан цахилгаан станц” байгуулах төслүүдэд хөрш орнуудтай идэвхтэй хамтран ажиллах саналаа илэрхийлсэн бөгөөд энэ чиглэлд шинжээчдийн түвшинд ажиллахаар болов.
Гурван улсын эдийн засгийн коридор байгуулах хөтөлбөрт тусгасан томоохон төслүүд хэрэгжиж эхлээд байгаа энэ үед 2018 онд тохиролцож байсны дагуу Хөрөнгө оруулалтын хамтарсан төвийг Улаанбаатар хотноо байгуулах бэлтгэл ажлыг эхлүүлэх саналыг дэвшүүлэв.
Үүнээс гадна шинжлэх ухаан, соёл, боловсрол, хүмүүнлэг, аялал жуулчлал, гамшигтай тэмцэх зэрэг гурван улсын хамтын ажиллагааны бусад салбарт анхаарал хандуулах хэрэгтэйг онцоллоо.
Талууд Монгол, Орос, Хятадын Төрийн тэргүүн нарын уулзалт амжилттай болж, хамтын ажиллагааны олон асуудлаар санал нэгдсэн гэдгээ дүгнэн тэмдэглэв.
Монгол Улс 2012 оноос эхлэн ОХУ, БНХАУ-тай гурван талаар эдийн засгийн салбарт өргөн хүрээтэй хамтын ажиллагаа өрнүүлэх, Монгол Улсын нутаг дэвсгэрээр дамжин өнгөрөх транзит коридор байгуулах саналыг дипломат шугамаар илэрхийлж ирсний үр дүнд гурван улсын Төрийн тэргүүн нарын уулзалтыг зохион байгуулах болж, Монгол, Орос, Хятадын гурван талт хамтын ажиллагаа шинэ шатанд гарсан болно.
Стратегийн түнш, хөрш орнуудын харилцааг өргөжүүлэн бэхжүүлэх, улс төр, эдийн засгийн гурван талт хамтын ажиллагааны цар хүрээг тэлэх зорилго бүхий энэхүү уулзалтыг 2014 оноос эхлэн уламжлал болгон зохион байгуулж ирсэн.
Уулзалтыг зохион байгуулж эхэлснээс хойш “Монгол, Орос, Хятадын Эдийн засгийн коридор байгуулах хөтөлбөр”-ийг байгуулж, хэрэгжүүлэх чиглэлд гурван талаас томилсон Ажлын хэсгийн дарга нарын уулзалт болон шинжээчдийн түвшний уулзалтыг тогтмол зохион байгуулж ирлээ.
Гурван талт яриа хэлэлцээний давтамжийг хадгалах хүрээнд гурван улсын дэд сайд нарын уулзалтыг тогтмол зохион байгуулж байна.
Монгол, Орос, Хятадын Төрийн тэргүүн нарын уулзалт нь КОВИД-19 цар тахлын дэгдэлтээс үүдэн 2019 оноос хойш түр хугацаанд завсардаад байв.
Энэ жилийн Төрийн тэргүүн нарын уулзалтыг ОХУ-ын Ерөнхийлөгч В.В.Путин даргалсан бөгөөд ирэх жилийн уулзалтыг БНХАУ-ын дарга, үүний дараа Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч даргална.

Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгчийн мэндчилгээнд:
“Манай улсын эрхэм хүндэт ард иргэд ээ,
Элэг нэгт монгол ахан дүүс ээ,
Хүн төрөлхтний түүхийн хүрд нэгэн оныг үдэж буй энэхүү торгон мөчид халуун ам бүл, хайртай дотны хүмүүстэйгээ шинэ оноо угтахаар сэтгэл догдлон хүлээж байгаа Та бүхэндээ шинэ он, шинэ жилийн баярын мэндийг өргөн дэвшүүлье.
Шинэ бүхний эхлэл шинэ жилийн баяр бол гэр бүл, айл өрх, улс үндэстнээрээ ажил үйлс, амжилт бүтээлээ дүгнэн цэгнэж, шинэ ондоо эрч хүч, итгэл найдвар, хүсэл тэмүүллээр дүүрэн байхыг бэлгэдэн ерөөж, аз жаргал, баяр хөөрөөр дүүрэн тэмдэглэдэг хүн төрөлхтний баяр билээ.
Сүүлийн жилүүдэд хүн төрөлхтөн, дэлхий нийтээрээ геополитик, геостратегийн ээдрээтэй цаг үеийг туулж, зөрчил мөргөлдөөнтэй дэлхий ертөнцөд амьдарч байна.
Энэхүү олон улсын нөхцөл байдал манай улсын эдийн засаг, ард түмний ахуй амьдралд сөргөөр нөлөөлж буй хэдий ч улиран одож буй 2025 он монголчууд бидний хувьд гадаад харилцаа, хамтын ажиллагаагаа өргөжүүлэн хөгжүүлж, хөдөө аж ахуй, хүнс үйлдвэрлэлийн салбарт ахиц дэвшил гаргаж, түүх, соёл, өв уламжлалаа дэлхий дахинд сурталчлан таниулсан түүхэн үйл явдлаар дүүрэн он байлаа.
Ард иргэд, баялаг бүтээгчид, төр, засаг хамтдаа хичээн зүтгэсний үр дүнд манай улсын эдийн засаг 6 хувиар өсөж, нэг хүнд ногдох Дотоодын нийт бүтээгдэхүүн 7,000 ам.долларыг давж, худалдаа, хөрөнгө оруулалт нэмэгдэн, гадаад валютын нөөц 6 тэрбум ам.доллар болж, Монгол Улсын зээлжих зэрэглэл түүхэн дээд түвшинд хүрлээ.
Улс орны аюулгүй байдлын баталгаа болсон хүнсний хангамж, аюулгүй байдлыг хангах зорилгоор улс орон даяар хэрэгжиж буй “Хүнсний хувьсгал” үндэсний хөдөлгөөний хүрээнд 53 хүнсний үйлдвэр шинээр ашиглалтад орж, 1,000 гаруй нэр төрлийн хүнсний бүтээгдэхүүнийг зах зээлд шинээр нийлүүллээ.
Мөн буянт мал сүргийнхээ түүхий эдийг боловсруулж, эдийн засгийн эргэлтэд оруулах зорилготой “Цагаан алт” хөтөлбөр амжилттай хэрэгжиж, бодит үр дүн гарч эхэллээ.
Эх орныхоо хөгжил дэвшлийн төлөө идэвх санаачилгатай ажиллаж, ард иргэдийг ажлын байраар ханган, төр, засгийнхаа бодлого, шийдвэрийг дэмжин ачааны хүндийг үүрч, улс орныхоо эдийн засгийг хөгжүүлэхэд үнэтэй хувь нэмэр оруулж буй бизнес эрхлэгч, баялаг бүтээгчид, нийт ард түмэндээ Монгол төрийн нэрийн өмнөөс гүн талархал илэрхийлье.
Улиран одож буй 2025 онд манай улсын гадаад бодлого, гадаад харилцаа улам өргөжин бэхжиж, түүхэнд тодоор бичигдэн үлдэх төрийн айлчлалууд амжилттай болж, Монгол Улсын нэр хүнд олон улсын тавцанд өсөн бэхжиж, монголчууд бидний баялаг түүх, бахдам соёл, суу алдрыг дэлхий дахинд сурталчлан таниулсан түүхэн онцгой жил байлаа.
Манай эрдэмтэн мэргэд, хүүхэд, залуус, урлаг, спортын салбарынхан олон улсын тавцанд эх орныхоо нэр хүнд, монгол хүний үнэ цэнийг өндөрт өргөж, оюун ухаан, тэсвэр тэвчээр, эр зориг, авьяас чадвараараа дэлхий нийтэд гайхагдан монгол түмнээ баярлуулсан бахдам сайхан жил боллоо.
Эрхэм хүндэт ард иргэд ээ,
Ирж буй шинэ ондоо төр, засаг, түмэн олноороо ололт, амжилтаа улам бататгаж, алдаа оноогоо дүгнэн цэгнэж, эвийг эрхэмлэж, зөвийг тэтгэж, ёсыг сахиж, улс Монголоо хөгжүүлэхийн төлөө улс үндэстнээрээ хамтдаа хичээн зүтгэцгээе.
Монгол хүн бүрийн зүрх сэтгэл нэгэн хэмнэлд цохилох баярын энэ үдэш шинэ оноо угтахаар сэтгэл догдлон хүлээж буй монгол түмэндээ хайр хүндлэл, амжилт бүтээл, урам зоригоор бялхаж байхын өлзийтэй сайхан ерөөлийг өргөн дэвшүүлье.
Он солигдох энэхүү торгон мөчид дархан хилээ манаж байгаа эр зоригт хилчин дайчид, даян дэлхийн энхтайвны төлөө эх орноо төлөөлөн хүчин зүтгэж буй энхийг сахиулагчид, хүн ардынхаа эрүүл мэндийн манаанд зогсож байгаа эмч, сувилагч, эмнэлгийн ажилтнууд, эх орон, ард иргэдийнхээ аюулгүй байдлыг хангах хариуцлагатай үүргээ нэр төртэй гүйцэтгэж буй төрийн албан хаагчид, цэрэг, цагдаа, онцгой байдлынхандаа Төрийн тэргүүн тусгайлан баяр хүргэж, ард түмнийхээ нэрийн өмнөөс гүн талархал илэрхийлье.
Айлчлан ирж буй 2026 онд иргэн бүр энх тунх, айл өрх бүр аз жаргал, амжилт бүтээлээр бялхаж, улс Монголын минь цог хийморь бадарч, даян дэлхий амар амгалан байх болтугай.
Мөнх тэнгэрийн хүчин дор Монгол Улс мандан бадрах болтугай.
Шинэ он, шинэ жилийн баярын мэнд хүргэе” гэжээ.

“Цагаан алт” хөтөлбөрийн дүнд түүхий эдийн 70 орчим хувийг дотоодын үйлдвэрлэгчид бэлтгэлээ
Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч Ухнаагийн Хүрэлсүх “Цагаан алт” үндэсний хүрээнд хөнгөн үйлдвэрлэлийн салбарт үйл ажиллагаа явуулж буй үндэсний аж ахуйн нэгжүүдэд ажиллалаа.
Ерөнхийлөгчийн эхэлж очсон “Тод оймс” ХХК 2011 онд байгуулагдсан. 200 гаруй ажилтантай. Жилдээ 1,000 тн түүхий ноос бэлтгэх, 200 тн утас, 10 сая хос оймс үйлдвэрлэх хүчин чадалтай.
Малчдын хотноос бэлтгэсэн түүхий эдээ  12 шат дамжлагаар боловсруулан эцсийн бүтээгдэхүүн болгож, дотооддоо 16 салбараар борлуулахын зэрэгцээ Орос, Казахстан, Солонгос, Япон, Америк, Герман, Франц зэрэг 16 улсад нийлүүлдэг.
“Цагаан алт” хөтөлбөрийн хүрээнд 4.2 тэрбум төгрөгийн эргэлтийн хөрөнгийн зээл авч түүхий эдээ нөөцлөн, үйлдвэрлэлээ өргөтгөжээ.
“Цагаан алт” хөтөлбөрийн дүнд “Гоёл кашмер” ХХК хүчин чадлаа 30 хувиар нэмжээ
“Гоёл кашмер” ХХК 2005 оноос ноос, ноолууран сүлжмэл, оёмол, нэхмэл, ширмэл бүтээгдэхүүн үйлдвэрлэж эхэлсэн.  Хоногт 500-1,000 бүтээгдэхүүн үйлдвэрлэх хүчин чадалтай.
200 гаруй ажилтантай. 10 салбар дэлгүүртэй, 20 гаруй улсад бүтээгдэхүүнээ экспортолдог. “Цагаан алт” хөтөлбөрийн хүрээнд 24 тэрбум төгрөгийн эргэлтийн болон хөрөнгө оруулалтын зээл авч хүчин чадлаа өргөтгөсөн байна.
Тухайлбал 2024 онд 26.8 тн түүхий эд бэлтгэсэн бол энэ онд 81.5 тн-ыг бэлтгэжээ. Мөн хугацаанд тоног төхөөрөмжийн хүчин чадал, үйлдвэрлэлийн хэмжээ, экспортын борлуулалтын орлого тус бүр 30 хувиар, ажлын байр 25 хувиар нэмэгджээ. “Гоёл кашмер” ХХК үндсэн үйлдвэрлэлээс гадна хүнсний хаягдлаар хөрсний Компост бордоо гаргаж авсан бөгөөд нэг тн бордоо 3,000 тн нүүрс хүчлийн хий бууруулдаг юм байна.
“Цагаан алт” үндэсний хөтөлбөрийн хүрээнд төр, засгаас бодлогын болон санхүүгийн дэмжлэг үзүүлж байгаад аж ахуйн нэгжүүдийн удирдлагууд талархаж, хөтөлбөрийг цаашид тууштай үргэлжлүүлэх, ялангуяа аль болох олон ээрэх үйлдвэр барих нь зүйтэй гэдгийг хэлж байлаа.
Ингэснээр ноос, ноолуурыг гэхэд л дотооддоо бүрэн боловсруулж, нэмүү өртөг шингэсэн бүтээгдэхүүн үйлдвэрлэх суурь бэхэжнэ. Мөн экспортын болон валютын хэмжээ өсөж, малчид, түүхий эд нийлүүлэгчдийн орлого нэмэгдэн, монгол ноолуурын үнэ цэн дэлхийд улам баталгаажна гэж үзэж байна.
Ерөнхийлөгч У.Хүрэлсүх малчид, нийлүүлэгчид, бусадтайгаа хамтран ажиллахын зэрэгцээ олон арван ажлын байр бий болгон, нэмүү өртөг шингэсэн  бүтээгдэхүүнээ дотоод, гадаадын зах зээлд нийлүүлж, татвараа төлж байгаа аж ахуйн нэгж, баялаг бүтээгчдэд талархал илэрхийллээ.
“Цагаан алт” хөтөлбөрийн дүнд 6,000 тн ноолуур бэлтгэсэн нь анх удаа түүхий эдийн 70 орчим хувийг өөрсдөө бэлтгэсэн гэсэн үг юм.
2025 оны 12 дугаар сарын 15-ны байдлаар ноос, ноолуур, арьс, шир боловсруулах үйлдвэрлэлийн хүчин чадлыг нэмэгдүүлэх, үйл ажиллагааг нь дэмжих зорилгоор аж ахуйн нэгжүүдэд 493 тэрбум төгрөгийн эргэлтийн болон хөрөнгө оруулалтын зээл олгоод байна. Үүний үр дүнд ээрэхийн хүчин чадал гэхэд л 400 тн-оор нэмэгдэж 2,000 гаруй тн болсон бол сүлжих хүчин чадал 200,000 ширхэгээр нэмэгджээ.
Манай улс 2023 онд 440 сая ам.долларын үнэ бүхий ноолуур, ноолууран бүтээгдэхүүн экспортолсон. “Цагаан алт” хөтөлбөрийн дүнд самнасан ноолуурын экспорт тав дахин нэмэгдээд байна.
“Цагаан алт” хөтөлбөр 2024-2028 онд хэрэгжинэ.
Хөтөлбөрийн дүнд ноолуурын бүрэн боловсруулалтын түвшнийг одоогийн 20 хувиас 40 хүртэл хувь, үйлдвэрлэлийг 1,5 их наяд төгрөгөөс 2,3 их наяд төгрөг, экспортыг 398 сая ам.доллароос 690 сая ам.доллар, шинээр гурван мянга гаруй ажлын байр бий болох юм.
Мөн:
Ноосны боловсруулалтын түвшнийг одоогийн 25 хувиас 55 хүртэл хувь, үйлдвэрлэлийг 240 тэрбум төгрөгөөс 670 тэрбум төгрөг, экспортыг 52 сая ам.доллароос 119 сая ам.доллар, шинээр 2,200 орчим ажлын байр,
Арьс, ширний боловсруулалтын түвшнийг одоогийн 30 хувиас 50 хүртэл хувь, борлуулалтыг 57,8 тэрбум төгрөгөөс 900 тэрбум төгрөг, экспортыг 9,6 сая ам.доллароос 22 сая ам.доллар, шинээр 3,000 гаруй ажлын байр, нийт 8,000 гаруй ажлын байр бий болно.
Үүний зэрэгцээ мал аж ахуйн гаралтай түүхий эдийн экспортын хэмжээ хоёр дахин нэмэгдэж, 800 орчим сая ам.долларт хүрэх юм.

Үүний дүнд аж ахуйн нэгжүүдийн хүчин чадал доод тал нь хоёр дахин нэмэгдлээ. 53 үйлдвэр ашиглалтад орж, хүнсний 1,000 гаруй нэр төрлийн бүтээгдэхүүн шинээр үйлдвэрлэж байна.
“Хүнсний хувьсгал” хөдөлгөөн, “Атрын IV аян”, “Шинэ хоршоо”, Цагаан алт” хөтөлбөрийн дүнд хүнс, хөдөө аж ахуй, хөнгөн үйлдвэрийн салбарт 44 мянган ажлын байр шинээр бий боллоо. Дотоодын нийт бүтээгдэхүүний 60 гаруй хувийг хөнгөн, хүнсний салбар бүрдүүлж байна. Эдгээр нь дээрх салбаруудад тогтвортой, кластер системийн суурь бэхжиж байгаагийн илрэл гэж болно.
Ерөнхийлөгч У.Хүрэлсүх ”Хүнсний хувьсгал”-д нэгдэн, үйлдвэрлэлээ өргөжүүлж, олон мянган ажлын байр бий болгон, татвараа төлж байгаа аж ахуйн нэгж, баялаг бүтээгчдэд болон хамтран ажиллаж байгаа төр, төрийн бус байгууллага, олон улсын байгууллагуудад талархал илэрхийллээ.
Төр, засгийн тогтвортой бодлого, дэмжлэг, төр-хувийн хэвшлийн хамтын ажиллагаа үр дүнд хүрдэг, монголчууд нэгдэж, хамтран зүтгэвэл юуг ч бүтээж чаддагийг  “Хүнсний хувьсгал” харуулж байгааг хэллээ.
Цаашид ололт, амжилтаа улам бататгаж, аж ахуйн нэгжүүд, баялаг бүтээгчдээ дэмжихийн зэрэгцээ ард иргэдийг эх оронч худалдан авалт хийж байхыг уриаллаа.
Гадаадын улс орнууд, тухайлбал Латин Америк, Европ, Азийн олон орон хүнсний хангамж, аюулгүй байдлаа хангахад дунджаар 20-30 жил зарцуулсан байдаг.
Иймээс “Хүнсний хувьсгал”-ын хугацааг таван жил гэж хязгаарлалгүй, тууштай үргэлжлүүлэх нь зүйтэй гэж үздэгээ үндэсний үйлдвэрлэгчид, аж ахуйн нэгж, баялаг бүтээгчид, иргэд илэрхийлж байлаа.
Өнгөрсөн хугацаанд “Хүнсний хувьсгал”, “Цагаан алт”-ын хүрээнд аж ахуйн нэгжүүдэд 300 гаруй тэрбум төгрөгийн татварын хөнгөлөлт, зээлийн хүүгийн дэмжлэг үзүүлжээ.
Зээлийн батлан даалтын сан барьцаа хөрөнгийн шаардлага хангахгүй аж ахуйн нэгжүүдэд зээлийнх нь 60 хүртэл хувьд баталгаа гаргаж байна.
“ХҮНСНИЙ ХАНГАМЖ, АЮУЛГҮЙ БАЙДАЛ” ҮНДЭСНИЙ ХӨДӨЛГӨӨНИЙ ХҮРЭЭНД:
Жилийн 1.5 тэрбум төгрөгөөс доош борлуулалтын орлоготой аж ахуйн нэгжүүдийн орлогын албан татварыг 90 хувиар хөнгөлсөн,
Үр тариа, төмс, хүнсний ногоо, сүү, жимс, жимсгэнэ, тэжээл, тэжээлийн ургамал тариалсан, мах, махан бүтээгдэхүүн үйлдвэрлэсэн эрчимжсэн тахианы аж ахуйн Орлогын албан татварыг 50 хувиар хөнгөлсөн,
Хүнс, хөдөө аж ахуйн гаралтай түүхий эд боловсруулах зориулалттай, тухайн үйлдвэрийн үндсэн хөрөнгөөр бүртгэгдэх шинэ тоног төхөөрөмжийг 2027 он хүртэл импортын гаалийн албан татвараас бүрэн чөлөөлсөн,
Дотооддоо тарьж борлуулсан үр тариа, төмс, хүнсний ногоо, суулгац, жимс жимсгэнэ, гурилыг НӨАТ-аас, дотооддоо үйлдвэрийн аргаар төхөөрч бэлтгэн дотооддоо борлуулсан тураг болон шулж ангилсан мах, боловсруулаагүй дотор эрхтэн, дайвар бүтээгдэхүүнийг НӨАТ-аас чөлөөлсөн,
Дотоодын түүхий эдээр боловсруулж, дотооддоо борлуулсан хүнсний сүү, сүүн бүтээгдэхүүнийг НӨАТ-аас чөлөөлсөн,
Импортын болон дотоодод борлуулсан хөдөө аж ахуйн зориулалттай шинэ трактор, комбайн, машин механизм, усалгаа, хүлэмжийн тоног төхөөрөмж, ойн болон шувууны аж ахуйн техник, тоног төхөөрөмж, бордоо, ургамал хамгааллын бодисыг 2025 он хүртэл НӨАТ-аас бүрэн чөлөөлсөн юм.

2025/12/10 2:54:49
Улсын хоёрдугаар төв эмнэлэг ирэх оноос амьд донороос бөөр шилжүүлэн суулгана
Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч Ухнаагийн Хүрэлсүх Улсын хоёрдугаар төв эмнэлэг, эмнэлгийн Эрхтэн шилжүүлэн суулгах төвд ажиллалаа.
Ерөнхийлөгч У.Хүрэлсүх бодлогын дэмжлэг үзүүлснээр тус эмнэлгийн Эрхтэн шилжүүлэн суулгах шинэ төв ашиглалтад орж, дурангийн болон бичил мэс засал, мэдээгүйжүүлэг, лабораторийн сүүлийн үеийн багаж, тоног төхөөрөмжтэй болсон юм.
Үүний дүнд эмч нарын баг өнгөрсөн гуравдугаар сараас хойш 43-65 насны таван хүнд амьд донороос дурангийн мэс заслын аргаар элэг шилжүүлэн суулгаад байна. Мөн 11 хүнд зүрхний титэм судсан дотуурх хэт авиан  оношилгоо, эмчилгээ,  найман хүнд хавдар хөлдөөх эмчилгээ хийжээ.
Эдгээрээс гадна элэг, улаан хоолой, ходоод, бүдүүн гэдэс, уушгины хавдрыг дурангийн аргаар тайрч, залгах 1,000 гаруй мэс засал хийгээд байна.
Төв ашиглалтад орсноор эрхтэн шилжүүлэн суулгах мэс засал хөгжих, хамгийн сүүлийн үеийн дэвшилтэт техник, технологи нутагших, хүмүүсээ сургаж бэлтгэх, бусад эмнэлгийн ачааллыг хуваалцахад томоохон дэмжлэг болсныг эмнэлэг, төвийн эмч нар ярилаа.
Манай иргэд гадаадын улс орнуудад, тухайлбал Япон, Солонгост 400-500 сая, Энэтхэг, Турк Улсад 150-350 сая төгрөгөөр элэг шилжүүлэн суулгуулдаг.
Шинэ төвийг богино хугацаанд ашиглалтад оруулж, гадаадад эмчлүүлэх гэж их хэмжээний мөнгө заралгүй, эх орондоо дэлхийн чанартай тусламж, үйлчилгээ авах боломж улам бүрдсээр байгаад эмч нар болон элэг шилжүүлэн суулгах мэс засал хийлгэсэн иргэд, тэдний донорууд Ерөнхийлөгчид талархал илэрхийллээ.
Ерөнхийлөгч У.Хүрэлсүх эмнэлгийн эмч, сувилагч, ажилтнуудтай уулзахдаа, ард иргэдийнхээ амь нас, эрүүл мэндийн төлөө өргөсөн тангарагтаа үнэнчээр зүтгэж байгаад нь талархаж, ажлын амжилт хүсэн ерөөлөө. Цаашид бусад эрхтнийг шилжүүлэн суулгах мэс засал  нэвтрүүлэх санал, санаачилгыг бүх талаар дэмжинэ гэдгээ хэллээ.
Улсын хоёрдугаар төв эмнэлгийн Эрхтэн шилжүүлэн суулгах төв ирэх оноос   элэгнээс гадна бөөр, уушги, нойр булчирхай, гэдэс шилжүүлэн суулгаж эхэлнэ. Улмаар робот мэс засал нэвтрүүлж, амьгүй донороос элэг шилжүүлэн суулгахаар төлөвлөжээ.
Манай улсад элэгний хавдрын өвчлөл жил бүр нэмэгдэж, хавдраар жилд 1,745 хүн, элэгний хатуурлаар 643 хүн нас барж байгаа нь дэлхийд өндөр үзүүлэлт юм. Элэгний хорт хавдрын өвчлөл дэлхийн дунджаас 7-8 дахин өндөр байна.  Улсын хэмжээнд элэгний донор хүлээж байгаа 325 хүн байдгийн 25 нь Улсын хоёрдугаар эмнэлэгт байгаа юм.

У.Хүрэлсүх: Хүний эрхийг хангах үндэсний хөтөлбөрийг шинэчлэн сайжруулах шаардлагатай
НҮБ-ын Ерөнхий Ассамблейгаас Хүний эрхийн түгээмэл тунхаглалыг баталсан 12 дугаар сарын 10-ны өдөр буюу Хүний эрхийн олон улсын өдрийг тохиолдуулан Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгчийн Тамгын газар, Хүний эрхийн үндэсний комисс хамтран Хүний эрхийн үндэсний форумыг “Хамтын эрх-хариуцлага” сэдвийн хүрээнд Блю Скай зочид буудалд зохион байгуулж байна.
Хууль, олон улсын хүний эрхийн гэрээ, конвенцоор баталгаажсан хүний эрх, эрх чөлөөг хангах, хамгаалах, дэмжих чиглэлээр авч хэрэгжүүлсэн арга хэмжээ, түүний үр дүн, үр нөлөөг үнэлэн дүгнэж, тулгамдаж буй асуудалд анхаарал хандуулан, шийдвэрлэх арга замыг тодорхойлж, ахиц дэвшил гаргах зорилгоор 2005 оноос хойш Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгчийн ивээл дор Хүний эрхийн үндэсний форумыг зохион байгуулж ирсэн юм.
Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч Ухнаагийн Хүрэлсүх форумын нээлтэд оролцон үг хэллээ.
Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч хэлсэн үгийнхээ эхэнд, “Тэртээх найман зууны өмнө монголчууд бидний өвөг дээдэс Ази, Европын олон үндэстэн хоорондын дайн тулаан, зөрчил тэмцлийг зогсоож, өрнө дорныг төрт ёс, хууль цаазын дор төвшитгөн “Монголын их амар амгалан”-г цогцлоож, улс түмнүүдийн харилцаа холбоо, эе эвийг бэхжүүлж, оюун санаа, шашин шүтлэг, худалдаа арилжаа, соёл урлаг, шинжлэх ухаан хийгээд тухайн үеийн хүний нийгэм хөгжин дэвжих таатай нөхцөлийг бүрдүүлж чадсан түүхтэй.
“Монголын их амар амгалан” нь өнөөгийн дэлхий дахины энх тайван, тогтвортой байдал, хүний эрхийг сахин хамгаалахын төлөөх хамтын хүчин чармайлтын үндэс суурь болохуйц дэвшилтэт үзэл санааг ийнхүү агуулж байсныг илтгэж байгаа юм.
Тэгвэл манай улс энэхүү түүхэн уламжлалаа орчин цагт бататган бэхжүүлж, хүн төрөлхтний соёл иргэншлийн ололтыг хүндэтгэн үзэж, анхдугаар Үндсэн хуулиасаа эхлэн эрэгтэй, эмэгтэй хүмүүс адил тэгш эрхтэй байхыг тунхаглан, ардчилсан шинэ Үндсэн хуулиараа хүний эрх, эрх чөлөөг нэг мөр баталгаажуулж чадсан билээ” хэмээн онцоллоо.
Хүний эрхийн олон улсын “Фрийдом Хаус” байгууллагаас эрхлэн гаргадаг судалгаагаар Монгол Улс иргэний болон улс төрийн эрхийн хэрэгжилтийн байдлаараа бүс нутагтаа “эрх чөлөөтэй” гэсэн ангилалд тогтмол багтаж ирсэн.
“Дэлхийн эдийн засгийн форум”-ын жендерийн зөрүүтэй байдлын үнэлгээний 2025 оны тайланд Монгол Улс нэг жилийн дотор 20 байраар урагшлан 65 дугаар байрт орсноор Ази, Номхон далайн бүс нутагтаа тавдугаар байрт эрэмбэлэгдэж байгаа юм.
Гэвч дэлхий дахинд хурдацтай өөрчлөгдөж буй нийгэм, эдийн засаг, улс төрийн нөхцөл байдал, уур амьсгалын өөрчлөлтийн сөрөг нөлөөнөөс үүдэлтэй хүний эрхийн нөхцөл байдалд олон шинэ сорилт, бэрхшээл тулгарч байгааг Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч тэмдэглэв.
Цаашид хүний эрх, эрх чөлөөг хангаж, хамгаалах үйл ажиллагаанд тулгарч буй олон сорилт, бэрхшээлийг шийдвэрлэхийн тулд хүний эрхийг хангах бодлогын нарийвчилсан төлөвлөгөө болох “Үндэсний хөтөлбөр”-өө шинэчлэн сайжруулах шаардлагатай байгааг тодотголоо.
Тухайлбал, цахим орчинд хүний эрхийг зөрчих, цахим технологи ашиглан үйлдэгдэж буй жендерт суурилсан хүчирхийлэл, цахим болон бодит орчинд хүүхдийн эрх зөрчигдөх, хүчирхийлэлд өртөх байдал нэмэгдэж, хүний эрхийг хамгаалахад шинэ сорилтууд тулгарч байгааг дурдав.
Тиймээс улс орнууд кибер аюулгүй байдлыг хангах, цахим орчинд хүний эрх, нэр төрийг хамгаалах эрх зүйн орчныг бүрдүүлэх явдал нэн чухал байгааг онцлон тэмдэглэлээ.
Түүнчлэн хот суурин газарт оршин суугаа иргэдийн эрх, амьдрах орчинд гарч буй сөрөг нөлөөлөл, агаар, ус, хөрсний бохирдол, хэт төвлөрлөөс үүдэлтэй нийгэм, эдийн засаг, хүний эрүүл мэнд, байгаль экологийн хүндрэлтэй асуудлууд өдөр ирэх тусам нэмэгдсээр байгааг сануулав.
Цаашид шинээр байгуулахаар төлөвлөсөн болон дахин төлөвлөлт хийх бүх хот, суурин газрыг хүнд ээлтэй, хүн төвтэй, ногоон хөгжилд суурилсан, нийгмийн суурь үйлчилгээг хангасан, ард иргэд эрүүл, аюулгүй орчинд амьдрах нөхцөлийг бүрдүүлэн хөгжүүлэх нь нэн чухал гэдгийг онцоллоо.
Тэрбээр, “Энэхүү зорилгын хүрээнд Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч эртний нийслэл Хархорум хотыг сэргээн байгуулах зарлигийг 2022 онд гаргаж, төрт ёс, түүх, соёлын үнэт зүйлийг шингээсэн, тогтвортой хөгжлийг дэмжсэн, нүүдлийн болон суурин соёл иргэншлийг орчин үеийн чиг хандлагатай хослуулсан, хөдөө аж ахуйн кластер, шинжлэх ухаан, аялал жуулчлалын төв болсон эко-ухаалаг хот болгон байгуулахаар шийдвэрлэж, бүтээн байгуулалтын ажлыг эхлүүлээд байна” хэмээн тэмдэглэв.
Монгол Улсын Хүний эрхийн үндэсний комиссын тухай хуулийг 2020 онд шинэчилсэн бөгөөд Хүний эрхийг хамгаалагчийн эрх зүйн байдлын тухай анхдагч хууль, Хүний хувийн мэдээлэл хамгаалах тухай хуулийг 2021 онд тус тус баталсан. Ингэснээр Монгол Улс хүний эрх хамгаалагчийн бие даасан хуулийг батлан хэрэгжүүлж буй Ази тивийн анхны улс болсон юм.
Эдгээр хуулийн хүрээнд Хүний эрхийн үндэсний комиссын бүрэлдэхүүн өргөжиж, эрүү шүүлтээс урьдчилан сэргийлэх үндэсний механизм, Хүний эрхийг хамгаалагчийг хамгаалах болон Хүний хувийн мэдээллийг хамгаалах бүтцийг шинээр байгуулсан.
Цаашид Хүний эрхийн үндэсний комиссын асуудал хариуцсан гишүүдийн чиг үүрэг, механизм хоорондын уялдааг хангах, үйл ажиллагаа, тогтолцооны нэгдмэл бодлоготой байх, орон нутагт ажиллах бүтэц зохион байгуулалтыг оновчтой болгох, үйл ажиллагааны үр нөлөөг нэмэгдүүлэх, эдийн засгийн баталгааг хангах чиглэлээр эрх зүйн орчныг боловсронгуй болгох, хүний нөөц, техник хэрэгсэл, орчин нөхцөлийг Парисын зарчимд нийцүүлэн улам сайжруулах шаардлагатай байгааг Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч онцлон тэмдэглэв.
Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч У.Хүрэлсүх хүний эрхийг хамгаалах, хэрэгжүүлэх, баталгаажуулах асуудал нь Үндсэн хуульд зааснаар төрийн бүхий л институцийн бодлогын төвд ямагт байх ёстойг тэмдэглэхийн сацуу хүний эрхэм чанарыг дээдэлж, хүнлэг ёс суртахуун, хүний эрх, эрх чөлөөг хамгаалах хүндтэй үүргээ ямагт сахин биелүүлэхийг төрийн байгууллага, албан тушаалтан, ард иргэдэд уриаллаа.
Энэ удаагийн форумын үеэр хүний эрхийг хангах үндэсний бодлогыг шинэчлэх, тогтолцоог бэхжүүлэх, төрийн байгууллага, хувийн хэвшил, иргэний нийгмийн байгууллагуудын олон талын оролцоотойгоор хүний эрхийн тулгамдаж буй асуудал, шийдэл, арга замын талаар хэлэлцүүлэг өрнүүлэх бөгөөд Хүний эрхийн үндэсний комисс байгуулагдсаны 25 жилийн ойг угтан зохион байгуулж байгаагаараа онцлог юм.

“Нэр нь үл мэдэгдэх цэргийн бунхан”-д цэцэг өргөж, хүндэтгэл үзүүллээ
Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч Ухнаагийн Хүрэлсүх Бүгд Найрамдах Итали Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч Сэржо Маттарэллагийн урилгаар тус улсад төрийн айлчлал хийж байна.
Ерөнхийлөгч У.Хүрэлсүх, гэргий Л.Болорцэцэг болон дагалдан яваа албаны төлөөлөгчид “Эх орны хүндэтгэлийн цогцолбор”-т зочилж, “Нэр нь үл мэдэгдэх цэргийн бунхан”-д цэцэг өргөж, хүндэтгэл үзүүллээ.
Ром хотын төв, Венецийн талбайд байрлах цогцолборыг олон жилийн дайн, тэмцлийн дараа буюу 1861 онд тархай бутархай вант улсуудыг нэгтгэж, орчин үеийн Италийн үндсийг тавихад голлох үүрэг гүйцэтгэсэн Хоёрдугаар Витторио Эммануэлэ хааны дурсгалд зориулан байгуулсан түүхтэй.
Витторио Эммануэлэ хааныг Италийн ард түмэн “Улс төрийн нэгдлийн эцэг” хэмээн үздэг байна.
1885 оноос 50 гаруй жилийн турш барьж бүтээсэн цагаан гантиг чулуун цогцолбор өдгөө түүх, архитектурын төдийгүй үндэсний бахархал, эв нэгдлийн илэрхийлэл болжээ.
“Нэр нь үл мэдэгдэх бунхан” нь Италийн ард түмний тусгаар тогтнол, итгэл үнэмшил, эх оронч үзлийн бэлгэ тэмдэг бөгөөд үүрд мөнхийг бэлгэдсэн мөнхийн гал асаалттай байдаг.
Үндэсний томоохон баяр, төрийн ёслолын үеэр төр, засгийнх нь тэргүүн болон тус улсад айлчилж буй гадаадын улс орны тэргүүн нар цэцэг өргөж, хүндэтгэл үзүүлдэг уламжлалтай юм.

Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч Ухнаагийн Хүрэлсүх Гэгээн Ширээт Улсын төрийн тэргүүн, Пап XIV Лео-гийн урилгаар 2025 оны 12 дугаар сарын 04-ний өдөр тус улсад төрийн айлчлал хийнэ.
Төрийн айлчлал нь Монгол Улсын төрийн тэргүүний түвшинд тус улсад 14 жилийн дараа хийх айлчлал юм.
Айлчлалын үеэр хоёр улсын төрийн тэргүүн албан ёсны уулзалт хийнэ. Мөн  Ерөнхийлөгч У.Хүрэлсүхэд Гэгээн Ширээт Улсын Төрийн Хэрэг эрхлэх газрын дарга Кардинал Пиетро Паролин бараалхана.
Монгол Улс Гэгээн Ширээт Улстай 1992 оны 04 дүгээр сарын 04-ний өдөр дипломат харилцаа тогтоосон юм.
Өнгөрсөн 30 гаруй жилийн хугацаанд харилцаа, хамтын ажиллагаа соёл, боловсрол, эрүүл мэнд, хүмүүнлэгийн салбарт идэвхтэй өрнөж байна.
2023 онд Ерөнхийлөгч У.Хүрэлсүхийн урилгаар Гэгээн Ширээт Улсын төрийн тэргүүн Пап Францис-ын хийсэн төрийн айлчлал хоёр улсын 800 орчим жилийн түүхтэй харилцаа, хамтын ажиллагааг өргөжүүлэн хөгжүүлэх түүхэн айлчлал болсон.
Пап IV Инносентээс 1245 онд Гүюг хаанд бичсэн болон 1246 онд Их хаанаас хариу болгон илгээсэн захидал нь хоёр улс олон зуун жилийн өмнө  харилцаж байсныг нотлох үнэт эх сурвалжид тооцогддог юм.

“Чингис хаан” тэргүүн зэргийн одонт, академич С.Нарангэрэл төр, ард түмэндээ талархал илэрхийллээ
Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч Ухнаагийн Хүрэлсүхийн зарлигаар “Чингис хаан” тэргүүн зэргийн одон хүртсэн академич С.Нарангэрэл төр, ард түмэндээ талархал илэрхийллээ.
“ЧИНГИС ХААН” ТЭРГҮҮН ЗЭРГИЙН ОДОНТ, АКАДЕМИЧ СОДОВСҮРЭНГИЙН НАРАНГЭРЭЛ:
Төрөлх эх орон, Монгол Улсынхаа тэргүүн зэргийн, хамгийн дээд одон, Их эзэн “Чингис хаан” одонг эгэл жирийн атлаа удам угшилтай иргэн, багш, эрдэмтэн, судлаач, хуульч надад хүртээж байгаад Монгол Улсын эрхэм хүндэт Ерөнхийлөгч Ухнаагийн Хүрэлсүх Танд, Монголын ард түмэндээ чин сэтгэлийн гүн талархлаа илэрхийлье.
Монгол Улсын маань газар зүй, байгаль орчин, цаг уур, орон гэр, амин зуулгад тохирсон тогтвортой хөгжил цэцэглэлт, хүн ардын маань сэтгэл тэнүүн амьдралын язгуур нь Их эзэн Чингис хааны маань та бидэнд үлдээсэн үнэт сургаалийн эрдэнэсийн сан, эрхэм бээрийн цаглашгүй их өвд оршиж байгааг миний бие ухаарч ойлгоод, иргэн бүрийнхээ ой санамжид монгол бахархлыг сэргээх болон соён гэгээрүүлэх үйлсэд нэн хэрэгтэй сургамжийг нь олж авахын төлөө эрэлхийлэн хайх, судлан шинжлэх ажлыг цөхрөлтгүй хийсний үр дүнд гаргаж авсан сургамж, дүгнэлтийн заримаас нь энэ сайхан “Монгол бахархлын  өдөр” та бүхэндээ хураангуйлан товч айлтгая.
Монгол бахархал бол олон зууны туршид огт хуучраагүй аж төрөх ёс, амьдралаа авч явах монгол айл өрх бүрийн арга билиг
,
гал голомтоо залгуулан үр хүүхдээ эгэл жирийн амьдралд жинхэнэ монгол хүн болгон төлөвшүүлэх, сурган хүмүүжүүлэх өнө эртний үнэт уламжлал, элгэмсүү их монгол хэлд маань оршин байсан байна.
Монгол бахархал бас  өвөг дээдсийнхээ гайхамшигт ухаанаас цаг ямагт суралцаж, түүнд суурилан амьдралаа тодорхойлж, цаашдын ажил үйлсийнхээ зүг чиг, эрч хүчийг олж авахад оршиж байжээ.
Монгол бахархал харийн улс гүрний аж төрөх ёсыг мөнхөд өөрийн болгодоггүй, нэг л мэдэхэд буцаад буурин дээрээ эргээд буучихдаг монгол хүмүүний язгуур мөн чанар, генд нь хадгалагдаж иржээ.
Ямар ч хүн өөрийнхөө гэр оронд өвлөж, нүдний цөцгий мэт нандигнаж ирсэн уламжлалаа хадгалахыг эрмэлздэгийн адил үзэсгэлэн төгөлдөр эх орныхоо хөрс шороон дээр таван хошуу мал сүргийн аж ахуй бүхий бэлчээр дагасан соёл иргэншлийн аж төрөх  ёс, мөнхөд оршин байхыг нэгэн цагт хүн төрөлхтний дотор асаж байсан жинхэнэ аз жаргалант амьдралын гал цог бадарч, эцэг тэнгэрээс заяасан эрч хүч цогцолсон амьдралын уламжлалт хэв маягаа үргэлж хадгалж явцгаахыг Их эзэн Чингис хаан монголчууд бидэндээ хичээнгүйлэн захиж үлдээжээ.
Их эзэн Чингис хааны маань нандигнаж байсан гурван үеийнхний амин хэлхээ холбоог хэрэв салгавал монголчууд бид өөдлөхгүй гэдгээ ухаарах цаг үетэй золгосон байна.
Их эзэн Чингис хааны маань бий болгосон монгол бахархал нь өвөг дээдсийнх нь генээр дамжиж, эрхэм бээрт өвлөгдсөн  дараах билиг оюунаас ундарч гарсныг судалгааны зарим үр дүн баттай харууллаа.
Их эзэн Чингис хаан маань монгол зарим хүмүүний бүдүүлэг, цэвдэг сэтгэлийг нь эелдэг, найрсаг, зочломтгой, шударга бусыг цэх голч шударга, залхуу хойрго, унхиагүйг нь ажилсаг, хөдөлмөрч, ханашгүй шунахайрлыг нь эс шунахуй, эрээ цээргүйг нь ичиж эмээдэг болгож өгсөн байна.
Түүнчлэн хүний мөсгүйг нь жудагтай, харгис хэрцгийг нь нинжин, худал хуурмагийг нь үнэн, хэн нэгнийхээ найдвар хөсөрдүүлэхийг нь итгэл даадаг, нэр хүндээ унагахыг нь нэр төрөө дээдэлдэг, амин хувиа хичээхийг нь нийтэч, хамтач болгож өгчээ.
Их эзэн Чингис хаан маань хэн нэгнийхээ тусыг хариулж чадахгүй юм аа гэхэд эргээд гай төвөг учруулдаггүй, сэтгэлийн тэнхээ муутайг нь тэсвэр тэвчээртэй, хагарал талцал, дайсагналыг нь эв эе, үзэн ядалт, өш хонзон, хорон муу санаархлыг нь өгөөмөр, атгаг бус сэтгэл, эргэж буцдаг шарвалтыг нь урвашгүй чанар болгон хувиргаж өгч байжээ.
Ингэсний үр дүнд XIII зуунд цул нэгдмэл, хүчирхэг монгол үндэстэн бүрэлдэж, тэдний сэтгэлийн эерэг сайхан энергид харийнхан өөрийн эрхгүй татагдаж, улмаар дэлхий дахинд 100 жилийн туршид шударга ёс, энхийг тогтоох ариун үйлсийг та бидний гайхамшигт өвөг дээдэс оройлон манлайлж, энэ хорвоогийн хүн ард эвтэй найртай эн зэрэгцэн аж төрөх нөхцлийг бүрдүүлж өгч байжээ.
Их эзэн Чингис хааны маань “Хаан миний бие их хээр талд аж төрөн сууж, цэх  шударгыг эрхэмлэн тогтоогоод, бүрэлгэн сүйтгэхийг хориглон зогсоож, идэх хоол, өмсөх хувцсаа адуучин, үхэрчинтэйгээ хуваалцан, ард иргэдийг үр хүүхэдтэйгээ  адил үзэж, цэрэг дайчид, эрдэмтэн мэргэдийг ах дүүгээ мэт хүндэлж, эе эвийг сахиулан энэрэл хишгээ түгээж явна аа” хэмээсэн айлдвар нь төр, засгийг барилцаж яваа хүмүүст хандсан нэг ёсны гэрээс өнөөдөр бас хатуу анхааруулга болж байна.
Монголчууд бид бүгдээрээ төрөлх Монгол эх орноо чин сэтгэлээсээ хайрладаг билээ.
Тийм учраас Их эзэн Чингис хааныхаа “Эцгийн нэрийг үр хүүхэд нь амьдруулж, эцгийн үйлсийг үр хүүхэд нь залгамжилнам уу” хэмээсэн айлдварыг нь үеийн үед монгол хүн бүр сүсэглэн дагаж явах нь энэ хорвоод монголчууд та бид төрөлх эх орондоо монголоороо үлдэх цорын ганц боломж ч байж болох юм.
Монголын ард түмэндээ мэхийн гүн хүндэтгэл, талархлаа дахин илэрхийлэхийн ялдамд Монгол Улсын төрийн тэргүүн Ухнаагийн Хүрэлсүх Танд Их эзэн Чингис хааны тухай бүтээлээсээ англи, орос, герман, солонгос, казах зэрэг хэлнээ хөрвүүлэгдэж, гадаадын зарим улсын хэвлэлийн газар нийтийн хүртээл болгосноос нь өргөн барья.
Их Богд эзэн Чингис хааныхаа гал голомтыг сахиж суугаа эрхэм бээрийн үр сад, Монгол Улсын эрхэм хүндэт иргэд ээ.
Их хааныхаа “Миний сургаалыг мянган онд хувиргалгүй, түмэн үедээ өөрчлөлгүй, ургийн ургаараа мөрдөн журамлатугай” хэмээснийг нь чанд сахин биелүүлж чадах юм бол та бидний буян хишиг арвижиж явахын билгэтэй ерөөлийг өргөн дэвшүүлье.
Баярлалаа.

МОНГОЛ УЛСЫН ЕРӨНХИЙЛӨГЧ УХНААГИЙН ХҮРЭЛСҮХ:
Их Монгол Улсын гал голомтыг сахин суугаа манай улсын ард иргэд ээ,
Дэлхий даяар тархан суугаа элэг нэгт монгол ахан дүүс ээ,
Эрхэм хүндэт зочид, төлөөлөгчид өө,
Та бүхэнд Дэлхийн мянганы суут хүмүүн, өнөөгийн дэлхий ертөнцийг үндэслэгчдийн нэг, монгол түмний өнө мөнхийн бахархал Их эзэн Чингис хааны мэндэлсний 863 жилийн ой, “Монгол бахархлын өдөр”-ийн мэндийг өргөн дэвшүүлье.
Монголчууд бид их хувь заяатай ард түмэн. Мөнх хөх тэнгэр монголчууд бидэнд аугаа их суу билигт хаадын хаан Эзэн Богд Чингис хааныг заяасан билээ.
Их эзэн Чингис хаан бол монгол үндэстний тусгаар тогтнол, оршин тогтнохуйн баталгаа, манай ард түмний үнэт зүйл, оюун санааны эх ундарга болсон өнө мөнхийн Их эзэн хаан, монголчуудын эрт, эдүгээ, ирээдүй гурван цагийн оюун санааны алтан хэлхээ юм.
Эзэн Богд Чингис хаан монгол овог аймгуудыг нэгтгэн Их Монгол Улсаа байгуулж, Хүннү гүрнээс улбаатай төрт ёсны алтан аргамжийг бататган бэхжүүлж, Монгол төрийн гал голомтыг сэргээн бадрааж, ертөнц дахинд дуурьсагдан өргөмжлөгдсөн билээ.
Чингис хаан болон түүний залгамжлагчид эв нэгдлээ бэхжүүлэн төр улсаа мандуулж, хууль цаазын дор түмэн олныг төвшитгөн захирч, Евроазийн өргөн уудам нутагт олон үндэстэн хоорондын дайн тулаан, зөрчил тэмцэлдээнийг зогсоож “Монголын их амар амгалан”-г тогтоон, оюун санаа, шашин шүтлэг, худалдаа арилжаа, соёл урлаг, шинжлэх ухаан хийгээд тухайн үеийн хүний нийгэм хөгжин дэвжих таатай нөхцөлийг бүрдүүлсэн их түүхийг бүтээж чадсан билээ.
Их эзэн Чингис хаан нэгэн хүмүүний амьдралд хийж үл барам, мянга мянган удирдагчийн хийж бүтээснээс илүү их түүх бүтээж, эгнэшгүй суу алдраа дэлхий ертөнцөд дуурьсгаж, судлан шинжилж үл дуусах арвин их өвийг хүн төрөлхтөнд үлдээсэн түүхтэй.
Чингис хааны түүх бол дан ганц монголчууд бидний түүх биш, дэлхий ертөнцийн түүх юм.
Далай их хааны суу билиг, үүх түүх, үзэл санаа, үйл хэргээс хүн төрөлхтөн, дэлхийн улс орнуудын удирдагч нар судлан суралцаж ирсэн бөгөөд Их эзэн Чингис хааныхаа суу алдар, билиг сургаалыг эрхэмлэн дээдэлж, даган мөрдөж, төрт ёсны үнэт зүйл, өв соёлыг үр хойчдоо өвлүүлэн үлдээж, эв эеэ сахин бататгаж, улс орноо мандуулахад хувь нэмрээ оруулж, төр улсынхаа төлөө хүчин зүтгэх нь өнөөгийн монголчууд бидний эрхэм үүрэг байх учиртай.
Тиймээс Их эзэн Чингис хааны мэндэлсэн энэхүү “Монгол бахархлын өдөр” монгол түмний төрт ёс, түүх, соёл, өв уламжлалыг судлан шинжилж, хадгалан хамгаалж, дэлхий дахинд сурталчлан таниулах их үйл хэрэгт үнэтэй хувь нэмэр оруулж, онцгой гавьяа байгуулсан Монгол Улсын болон гадаадын иргэн, хуулийн этгээд, төр нийгмийн зүтгэлтэнд төрийн дээд шагнал “Чингис хаан” тэргүүн зэргийн одонг Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч соёрхон гардуулдаг сайхан уламжлалтай билээ.
Энэ жил энэхүү эрхэм дээд шагналаар ардчилсан Үндсэн хуулийг хэрэгжүүлэх эх үндэс болсон хууль тогтоомжийг шинэчлэн батлах, хууль зүйн боловсролтой мэргэжилтэн бэлтгэх, үндэсний эрх зүйн тогтолцоо, хууль зүйн шинжлэх ухааныг хөгжүүлэхэд оруулсан үнэтэй хувь нэмэр хийгээд Эзэн Чингис хааны дэлхий дахинд шударга ёс, энхийг тогтоосон их үйл хэрэг, гарамгай гавьяаг сурвалжлан судлахад олон жилийн нөр их хөдөлмөр зүтгэлээ зориулж, эх оронч үндэсний үзлийг төлөвшүүлэх олон арван бүтээл туурвин, шинжлэх ухааны болон сургалт, судалгааны эргэлтэд оруулсныг өндрөөр үнэлэн эрхэм хүндэт академич Содовсүрэнгийн Нарангэрэл Таныг Монгол Улсын төрийн дээд шагнал, “Чингис хаан” тэргүүн зэргийн одонгоор шагнан алдаршуулж байна.
Монгол Улсын төрийн дээд шагнал “Чингис хаан” тэргүүн зэргийн одон хүртсэн эрхэм хүндэт академич Содовсүрэнгийн Нарангэрэл Танд Монголын төр засаг, ард түмнийхээ нэрийн өмнөөс чин сэтгэлийн халуун баяр хүргэе.

Хууль зүйн шинжлэх ухааны доктор, профессор, МУИС-ийн эмерит профессор, Япон Улсын Нагояагийн Их сургуулийн хүндэт доктор С.Нарангэрэл нь удам дамжсан нэрт эрдэмтэн төдийгүй, багш, сурган хүмүүжүүлэгч, соён гэгээрүүлэгч юм.
Тэр бээр манай улсын хууль зүйн боловсролын ууган гал голомт болсон МУИС-ийн Хууль зүйн сургуульд 50 гаруй жил багшлахдаа хууль зүйн салбарын 30 гаруй эрдэмтэн, олон мянган хуульч бэлтгэн гаргасан төдийгүй орчин цагийн хууль зүйн шинжлэх ухаан, үндэсний эрх зүйн тогтолцоог хөгжүүлэхэд жинтэй хувь нэмэр оруулсан.
Тухайлбал, үндэсний эрх зүйн тогтолцоо бүрэлдэн тогтох, өрнийн эрх зүйг судлан суралцах үндэс суурь болсон хууль зүйн нэр томьёо, эрх зүйн тайлбар толь цуврал бүтээл, англи, орос хууль зүйн толь бичиг зэргийг зохиож нийтийн хүртээл болгосон билээ.
Түүнчлэн онол болон практикийг хослуулж прокурор болон Монголын өмгөөлөгчдийн холбооны Ерөнхийлөгчөөр ажилласан зэрэг нь түүнийг нэрт хуульч, өмгөөлөгч хэмээх алдарт хүргэсэн юм.
Шинжлэх ухааны гавьяат зүтгэлтэн С.Нарангэрэл нь түүхэн сурвалж, хөлгөн судар, эрдэмтэн мэргэдийн бүтээл туурвилд тулгуурлан “Чингис хааны ёс суртахуун – Эрх зүйн шастир”, “Монгол ёс суртахуун: Бадрал, уналт, эргэн сэргээлт”, “Ёс суртахууны цагаан толгой” хэмээх монголчуудын ёс суртахууны үнэт уламжлал, үнэ цэн, уналт сэргэлт, монгол хүний удирдлага болгох учиртай ёс суртахууны хэм хэмжээг нэгтгэн дүгнэж, улс орны тогтвортой хөгжлийн амин сүнс нь ёс суртахуун болохыг тодотгож, хүн төрөлхтний сэтгэлгээний хөгжилд монголчуудын оруулсан үнэтэй хувь нэмрийг бодит эх баримтад түшиглэн тайлбарласан бүтээлүүдээрээ Монгол Улсын Төрийн шагнал хүртсэн билээ.
Академич С.Нарангэрэлийн туурвисан “Хуулийн амин сүнс буюу Чингис хаан, монголчууд” хэмээх бүтээлд Чингис хааны хууль цаазын сэтгэлгээний онцлогийг шинжлэн судалж, их хааны үйл хэрэг, хуулийн амин сүнс нь ёс суртахуун болохыг тогтоож, хууль, эрх зүй нь ёс суртахууны эрхэм чанарыг хамгаалан бэхжүүлэх, хэвшүүлэн мөрдүүлэх хүчирхэг хэрэглүүр болохыг шинжлэх ухааны үндэслэлтэйгээр тогтоосон байдаг.
Энэхүү бүтээл эдүгээ англи, орос, герман, казах, солонгос зэрэг хэлнээ орчуулан хэвлэгдэж, дэлхийн улс орнуудад Их эзэн Чингис хааны билиг сургаал, үйл хэргийг сурталчлан таниулж, түгээн дэлгэрүүлэхэд үнэтэй хувь нэмэр оруулсныг онцлон тэмдэглэхэд таатай байна.
Эзэн Чингис хаанаараа овоглох эрхэм дээд алдар хүртсэн Танд Монгол төр, Монголын ард түмэн гүн хүндэтгэл үзүүлж байна.
Таны эрдэм судлалын их үйлсэд амжилт бүтээлийн дээдийг хүсэж, Танд болон таны сайхан гэр бүлд аз жаргал, эрүүл энх, сайн сайхан бүхнийг хүсэн ерөөе.
Дэлхийн мянганы суут хүмүүн, өнөөгийн дэлхий ертөнцийг үндэслэгчдийн нэг, хаадын хаан Их эзэн Чингис хааныхаа мэндэлсний түүхт ойн баярын мэндийг Их хааны үр сад болсон монголчууддаа дахин дэвшүүлье.
Мөнх тэнгэрийн хүчин дор Монгол Улс мандан бадрах болтугай.

“Цагаан алт” хөтөлбөрийн дүнд самнасан ноолуурын экспорт тав дахин  нэмэгдэж, 244 сая ам. долларт хүрлээ
Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч Ухнаагийн Хүрэлсүх “Цагаан алт” хөтөлбөрийн хүрээнд үндэсний үйлдвэрлэгч аж ахуйн нэгжүүдэд ажиллалаа.
“Эвсэг” ХХК 2005 онд тансаг зэрэглэлийн нэхмэл болон гадуур хувцас үйлдвэрлэж эхэлсэн бөгөөд өдгөө салбартаа “Говь” ХК-ийн дараа хоёрдугаарт ордог компани болжээ.
Жилд 500 тн түүхий ноолуурт анхан шатны боловсруулалт хийхээс гадна 200 тн ноолуур ээрч, 500 мянган ширхэг сүлжих, 150 мянган метр нэхмэл, тус бүр 15 мянган ширхэг ширмэл, оёмол бүтээгдэхүүн үйлдвэрлэж байна.

Цаашид хэвийн зээлтэй аж ахуйн нэгжүүдэд эргэлтийн хөрөнгийн зээлийг үргэлжлүүлэн олгож байх, хөрөнгө оруулалтын зээлийн эргэн төлөх хугацааг дөрөв биш, 6-10 жил болговол аж ахуйн нэгжүүдэд улам их дэмжлэг болохыг  хэлж байлаа.
Манай улс 2023 онд 440 сая ам.долларын үнэ бүхий ноолуур, ноолууран бүтээгдэхүүн экспортолсон.
“Цагаан алт” хөтөлбөрийн хүрээнд энэ онд ноолуурын чиглэлийн үйлдвэрлэл эрхэлдэг 54 аж ахуйн нэгж 245 тэрбум төгрөгийн эргэлтийн болон хөрөнгө оруулалтын зээл авсан байна.

Томоохон сүлжээ дэлгүүрүүд талбайнхаа тодорхой хэсгийг хөнгөлөлттэй үнээр түрээслүүлдэг байх, хөдөлмөр хамгаалал, тусгай зориулалтын гутлын импортын гаалийн татварыг нэмэх, эх оронч худалдан авалтыг хөхиүлэн дэмжих нь зүйтэй гэж үздэгээ илэрхийллээ.

Хөтөлбөрийн хүрээнд бодлогын болон хөрөнгө, татварын дэмжлэг үзүүлж байгаа нь хөдөө аж ахуй, хөнгөн үйлдвэрийн салбар хөгжих, малчдын орлого нэмэгдэх зэрэг олон давуу тал авчирсныг аж ахуйн нэгжүүдийн удирдлагууд хэлж байлаа.
Энэ жил аж ахуйн нэгжүүдэд эргэлтийн хөрөнгийн зээл хэлбэрээр 400 тэрбум, хөрөнгө оруулалтын зээлд 389 тэрбум төгрөг олгохоор төлөвлөсөн. Мөн Засгийн газраас хариуцан төлөх хүүгийн хөнгөлөлтөд 66 тэрбум төгрөг зарцуулна.
Өнөөдрийн байдлаар 100 орчим аж ахуйн нэгж нийт 478 тэрбум гаруй төгрөгийн зээл аваад байна.
Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч У.Хүрэлсүх “Цагаан алт” хөтөлбөрт манлайлан оролцож, малын гаралтай түүхий эдийг үнэд оруулах, үйлдвэрлэлээ өргөтгөх, ажлын байр бий болгох, нэмүү өртөг шингэсэн бүтээгдэхүүн үйлдвэрлэх, малчдын орлогыг нэмэгдүүлэх, татвараа төлөх зэргээр бодит хувь нэмэр оруулж байгаа аж ахуйн нэгжүүдэд талархал илэрхийллээ.
“Цагаан алт” үндэсний хөтөлбөр 2024-2028 онд хэрэгжинэ.

Ажлын байрны талбай 6,000 гаруй м2-аар,
Эргэлтийн хөрөнгө 20 орчим хувиар,
Борлуулалтын орлого 18 хувиар,
Бүтээгдэхүүний нэр төрөл 15-аар,
Улсад төлөх татварын хэмжээ 14 хувиар нэмэгджээ.

Мөн “Хүнсний хангамж, аюулгүй байдал-2” үндэсний хөдөлгөөн өрнүүлж, 50 гаруй тэрбум төгрөгийн хөрөнгө оруулбал дотоодын үйлдвэрүүдийн хүчин чадал одоогийнхоос 28-33, улсад төлөх татварын хэмжээ 20 хувь нэмэгдэх боломжтой юм байна.
“Жүр үр” ХХК шинэ үйлдвэрээ ашиглалтад оруулжээ
“Жүр үр” ХХК  “Хүнсний хангамж, аюулгүй байдал” үндэсний хөдөлгөөний хүрээнд бага хүүтэй, урт хугацаатай зээл авч, 10,000 кв.м талбай бүхий үйлдвэрээ ашиглалтад оруулжээ.
Үйлдвэрт Герман, Нидерланд, Итали, Испанийн талх, нарийн боов, бялуу үйлдвэрлэх автомат шугам, шарах шүүгээ, хөргүүртэй агуулахууд, гүн хөлдөөгч төхөөрөмж суурилуулсан байна.
Ингэснээр үйлдвэрлэлийн бүтээмж нь 2-4 дахин нэмэгдэж, хүчин чадал 50-200 хувиар өсөх боломж бүрджээ.
Энэ үйлдвэр бол “Хүнсний хангамж, аюулгүй байдал” үндэсний хөдөлгөөний үр дүн, аж ахуйн нэгжүүд, баялаг бүтээгчдийг бодитоор дэмжиж байгаагийн  илрэл гэдгийг компанийн удирдлагууд хэллээ.
“Жүр үр” ХХК 1,200 гаруй хүнийг ажлын байраар хангадаг, 36 салбартай, 300 гаруй харилцагчаар дамжуулан 40 гаруй нэрийн бялуу, 140 гаруй төрлийн амттан нийлүүлж байна.
Төрөөс мах, сүү, газар тариалан гээд хүнсний үйлдвэрлэлийн салбарыг тасралтгүй дэмжиж ирсэн ч гурилан бүтээгдэхүүний үйлдвэрлэл хамрагддаггүй байсан.
Тэгвэл “Хүнсний хангамж, аюулгүй байдал” үндэсний хөдөлгөөний хүрээнд энэ салбарыг анх удаа бодлогоор дэмжиж байгаад талархал илэрхийллээ.
Хүнс, хөдөө аж ахуйн салбар өнгөрсөн жилийн мөн үетэй харьцуулахад Дотоодын нийт бүтээгдэхүүнд 5.6 хувийн өсөлт авчирсан. Энэ өсөлтийн 3.6 хувийг  хүнсний боловсруулах салбарын үйлдвэрлэл эзэлж байна.
Гол нэр төрлийн 19 бүтээгдэхүүнээр дотоодын хэрэгцээгээ хангах “Хүнсний хангамж, аюулгүй байдал” үндэсний хөдөлгөөнд нэгдэн, бодит үр дүн гаргаж байгаа аж ахуйн нэгжүүд, баялаг бүтээгчдэд Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч У.Хүрэлсүх талархал илэрхийллээ.

TITLE: “Хүнсний хувьсгал”-ын үр дүнд 53 үйлдвэр ашиглалтад орлоо - Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгчийн Тамгын Газар

2025/10/28 2:10:16
“Хүнсний хувьсгал”-ын үр дүнд 53 үйлдвэр ашиглалтад орлоо
Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч Ухнаагийн Хүрэлсүх “Хүнсний хангамж, аюулгүй байдал” үндэсний хөдөлгөөний хүрээнд үндэсний үйлдвэрлэгч аж ахуйн нэгжүүдэд ажиллалаа.
Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч У.Хүрэлсүхийг “Түмэн шувуут” ХК-ийн “Агро фийд” тэжээлийн үйлдвэрт хүрэлцэн ирэхэд компанийн ТУЗ-ийн дарга Л.Эрхэмбаяр, гүйцэтгэх захирал Ж.Болд нар тоног төхөөрөмжийн шинэчлэлт, бүтээн байгуулалт болон үйлдвэрийн үйл ажиллагааг танилцууллаа.
“Түмэн шувуут” ХК урт хугацаатай, хөнгөлөлттэй зээл авч, өнгөрсөн онд “Түмэн шувуут-2” үйлдвэрээ ашиглалтад оруулан, дараагийн үйлдвэрээ барьж байна.
Энэ онд 170 сая, ирэх жил 250 сая ширхэг өндөг үйлдвэрлэх бөгөөд энэ нь дотоодын зах зээлийн 40 хувь гэсэн үг юм. 2026 онд бүрэн хүчин чадлаараа ажиллаж 50 хувийг хангах юм байна.
Тус компанийн “Агрофийд” үйлдвэр тахианы болон мал, амьтны тэжээл үйлдвэрлэж, 21 аймгийн шувууны 25 аж ахуйг тэжээлээр хангаж байна. Энэ онд 40 мянга, ирэх жил 55 мянган тн тэжээл үйлдвэрлэх юм.
Энэ онд дотоодын үйлдвэрлэгчдээс 38 мянган тн улаан буудай, хивэг, овьёос зэргийг худалдан авсан бол 2026 онд 53 мянган тн-ыг авахаар төлөвлөжээ.
Компанийн удирдлагууд мөн махны чиглэлийн “Дорпер” хонины үржлийн аж ахуйн төслийнхөө талаар танилцууллаа.
Компани 2004 онд байгуулагдсан, дөрвөн салбар үйлдвэртэй, 360 гаруй ажилтан, албан хаагчтай. 17 нэр төрлийн савлагаатай өндөг, 10 нэр төрлийн мал, амьтны тэжээл болон шувууны сангасыг боловсруулж органик бордоо үйлдвэрлэж байна.
19 мянга гаруй хувьцаа эзэмшигчтэй бөгөөд 2019-2023 онд 10 тэрбум төгрөгийн ногдол ашиг тараажээ.
Манай улс 2020 оноос өмнө хэрэгцээт өндөгнийхөө 50-иас илүү хувийг импортоор авдаг, цөөн хэдэн аж ахуйн нэгжийн тоног төхөөрөмж, барилга байгууламж нь хуучирч муудсан байлаа.
2022 оноос хэрэгжиж эхэлсэн “Хүнсний хангамж, аюулгүй байдал” үндэсний хөдөлгөөний үр дүнд аж ахуйн нэгжийн тоо өсөж, хүчин чадал, тоног төхөөрөмж нь сайжирч, энэ хэрээр үйлдвэрлэл нэмэгдсэн юм.
Ирэх хоёр жилийн дотор дотоодын 30 гаруй шувууны аж ахуй нийт 3 сая тоо толгой шувуутай болж, жилд дунджаар 650 сая ширхэг өндөг үйлдвэрлэнэ.
Ингэснээр дотоодын хэрэгцээг энэ онд 80 хувь, ирэх жил 100 хувь хангах боломж бүрдэнэ.
Гол нэр төрлийн 19 бүтээгдэхүүнээр дотоодын хэрэгцээгээ хангах зорилт дэвшүүлсэн “Хүнсний хангамж, аюулгүй байдал” үндэсний хөдөлгөөнийг эхнээс нь тууштай дэмжиж, бодит үр дүн гаргаж байгаа аж ахуйн нэгж, баялаг бүтээгчдэд Монгол Улсын Ерөнхийлөгч У.Хүрэлсүх талархал илэрхийллээ.
“Хүнсний хангамж, аюулгүй байдал” үндэсний хөдөлгөөний хүрээнд 3,000 гаруй аж ахуйн нэгж 1.2 их наяд төгрөгийн урт хугацаатай, хөнгөлөлттэй зээл аваад
байна.
